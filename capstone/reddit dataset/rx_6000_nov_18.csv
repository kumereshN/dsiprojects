On top we have holiday season so extra high.

We have COVID demand as more people are staying home and gaming in the winter is going to be the new norm, extra extra high.

Supply chain issues due to COVID, extra extra extra high.

" FROM B&H PHOTO

&#x200B;

Graphics cards are showing immense demand this year and the latest AMD Radeon RX 6000 series is yet another amazing product. Unfortunately, availability of the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT is extraordinarily limited. At this time, B&H does not know when and to what extent we will receive product to offer for sale. To avoid disappointing customers, we have decided to not accept preorders or orders for these cards. We do not know and are therefore unable to provide a date or time for when these items will become available to purchase.

This limitation is across all of B&H’s sales channels, including phone, chat, online, or even in person at the B&H SuperStore. Our sales teams are always glad to help, but will not be able to provide any information on these products at this time.

We ask that you all stay tuned for more information and bear with us as we navigate this launch. If and when we receive inventory, we will update our website.

While we know the demand for this new card is incredibly high, we want to make sure we do not disappoint our customers.",rx_6000_nov_18

Full quote:

>What you are going to see will be different from what NVIDIA has done.  
>  
>AMD MBA cards will be in short supply up front. However, where you saw NV front-load almost all its cards, AMD is backloading. Once AIB cards hit, you will see 5 to 7 times the inventory released than what NV has shipped total in NA at this time. AMD will be heavily back-loaded into the channel. AMD is shipping ASIC BOM kits nearly daily to AIBs at this point and it will continue to happen throughout Q4. There will be a decent supply through Q4.  
>  
>**Now let me say this again as it is worth hearing. There is no way that when AMD was doing its projections for supply, that it could have even fathomed that NVIDIA would totally shit the bed on 3080/90 supply for the quarter, effectively abandoning the $500 to $1000 GPU TAM. NVIDIA has left such a gaping hole in the market that there is no way it can be filled currently. From my information and analysis, AMD projected to grow its portion of the TAM and will have inventory to do that. The sad fact is that NV simply abandoned its customer in that market and there is no possible way for AMD to fill the void.**

Funny thing is I canceled it earlier in the month since I managed to snag a 3080 but I guess they forgot to cancel it. So essentially looks like cards are coming in stock now??

&#x200B;

Edit: I refused the order because you know 3080 and such. so who ever was behind me, enjoy your card if you are also still waiting :)",rx_6000_nov_18
"It finally happened to me I got the dreaded email today, saying that my sapphire 6800xt was not going to be coming (First at Barrie CC). I then proceeded to ask for a full refund and was turned down. I am honestly disgusted with both AMD and Canada computers, they both are to blame for how horrible the experience was for anyone who purchased a card from them. I am now first inline for the Nitro SE, but am not happy about it paying 400$ more for a card that I never really wanted. Anyone think it would be worth the wait to switch to a 3080 list ?

Edit: I’m new to reddit but I hope everyone who has seen my original sees this update. Also I was working on the weekend which is why I delt with this today (Monday). It seems that there was a misunderstanding and which lead me to believe that there was no way for a refund however I can confirm now that I was offered a refund for all my money back. Keep in mind however this was me physically walking into the store, not asking for one via email. I just wanted to clear things up and say thank you to everyone who encouraged me to stand up for myself. Currently have no intentions of choosing a card on this day. I may consider buying one when and if stock replenishes. For now however my RX570 will do. Currently thinking about joining the wait list for the vision 3080. 😁",rx_6000_nov_18

Rep who spoke to Manager at Centerpoint doesn't know if they get anything tmr which is unlikely. They are taking pre-orders as well but more of a mixed message on if existing pre-orders take priority over partner pre-orders.

I was given the option to move my deposit to an AIB for slightly more cost that a 3080 card.  This was the call I was waiting for to finally make my decision.  AMD, to keep it polite, you completely messed up and lost my business.  I was willing to support your product line for the first time due to a quality product at \~$300 less then a similar (but not equal) product by NVIDIA.  I bought your product at the advertised price and you did not meet your end of the deal to provide the product to me.  In most jurisdictions, this is called false advertising.

I moved my order to an EVGA 3080 product at similar price to the AIB 6800XT and will enjoy the RTSS and ray tracing  features I was willing to sacrifice for your fictitious value proposition.

I moved from 4th in line to 15th due to my choice but I am content with my decision.  May see it prior to the end of Jan 2021 as there has been a steady flow of EVGA product line into their stores.

1. CC looks they won't be fulfilling reference orders with AIB partner models.
2. There is literally no stock anywhere and this is undoubtedly a worse launch then Nvidia
3. Canada gets shafted real hard.

My only real concern though is what the hell is CC going to do if they can't fulfill reference card orders? They honestly can't expect us to be happy if they force us to order AIB models but get thrown in the back of line for them after paying our deposits in full a few weeks ahead of others right? That is legitimately unfair, we basically gave them an interest free loan.

He said that they are unsure since shipment comes in tonight and the website stock gets updated about 30 min after receiving it in-store (manual data entry I'm assuming). He didn't sound too confident that they'd even have any in stock and it's in-person orders only. My guess is they'll have a couple of the cards but the rest will be backorder/queue.",rx_6000_nov_18
"so after seeing a few of you saying you called your local Memory express and was told they wont have any cards tomorrow, I just called my local memory express and asked if they will have any at all as Im planning on camping out the store from around 11pm tonight.  he straight up said ""sorry I have no information""  so i asked, ""like you arent allowed to give info or you guys dont know either""  his response ""Sorry, no information at all""  like didnt even answer the question...   is there an embargo on stock info?? or is he just being a dick?  ill be so frustrated if i camp out for 11 hours in the wind and rain only to find out they have none at all",rx_6000_nov_18

"I think the best course of action would be to drop a link to Tom's Hardware's text review. Non-RT games seem to be where the RX 6800 and XT excel at, though I think the 10-game raytracing average is where the numbers will matter most two years later.

I do not know what to make of this myself. I guess if you A) wanna support the principle that nVidia needs viable competition and B) have a backlog to clear but also want to enjoy the newest multiplatform games, the RX 6800 will still most likely be a solid choice.

Graphics cards are showing immense demand this year and the latest  AMD Radeon RX 6000 series is yet another amazing product. Unfortunately,  availability of the RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT is extraordinarily limited.   At this time, B&H does not know when and to what extent we will  receive product to offer for sale.  To avoid disappointing customers, we  have decided to not accept preorders or orders for these cards.  We do  not know and are therefore unable to provide a date or time for when  these items will become available to purchase.

This limitation is across all of B&H’s sales channels,  including phone, chat, online, or even in person at the B&H  SuperStore. Our sales teams are always glad to help, but will not be  able to provide any information on these products at this time.

We ask that you all stay tuned for more information and bear with  us as we navigate this launch.  If and when we receive inventory, we  will update our website. 

While we know the demand for this new card is incredibly high, we want to make sure we do not disappoint our customers.",rx_6000_nov_18

Here's the more practical question, which back order will come in first - 3080 or 6800xt??? Seems like AMD is better fulfilling the Zen3 backorders than Nvidia is fulfilling the 3080 backorders...but not sure if it will be the same for the GPUs.",rx_6000_nov_18

"Somebody correct me if I am wrong. Nvidia is mocking up the RT cores into their card. However, since the new Unreal Engine is coming up, all the RT calculations will be build upon the background system.

"Feel free to sell it for $50+ to someone interested. I would not call you a scalper. You put the effort and time to order and you can reward yourself and make someone else happy. Everything has value. Think about it this way. You decide to sell it locally for some profit. Someone who decides to buy a GPU at the same time you decided to sell can end up with a GPU the same day :) They pay the premium for SAME DAY DELIVERY :)

You can also try to sell for more than that and I wouldn't call you a scalper/ripper or anything else. This is not a necessity...People can simply wait and pay MSRP one day. This exists everywhere not only when GPUs are released.

And lastly, you can try selling it for 100k....If someone has an interest in buying it...well you did nothing wrong. If it makes them happy so be it. Nobody is forcing anyone to buy anything. A GPU is an object that can make people happy via games or productivity or just having the newest thing in their hands.

I had a 3070 FE that I sold for profit...Guess what I sold my previous GPU as well. So now I don't have a GPU.

The person I sold to was extremely happy and pumped and I was happy because I spent the profit on something that was more important for me :)

Obviously then there is the extreme case where people are using this as a business. If that is the case then they should register a company and pay their share of taxes.

And last point of view...If you feel not asking for an extra penny on top of what you paid then this is what makes you happy and comfortable. 

Returning it can give you some comfort as well, maybe because you are thinking you are handing the GPU to another person who really wants it.

"IMO there is no easy decision on this right now. However, I expect the 6800xt to have a longer usable life. It will never run ""RTX"" games well, but it will run the same raytracing that is being used on console games well. It also has the extra vram. The 3080 is faster right now but next year when games start taking advantage of more vram it won't matter that the interface it uses is faster it will run out of ram.   


That's what I expect anyway. At this point if you are wanting Nvidia the best idea would be to wait for the Ti that's coming in January. At least that card is going to last for a few years as a high end card.",rx_6000_nov_18

"It depends on what your requirements are. For example, for me, AMD has nothing to offer in terms of RTX voice equivalent (which is essential to my WFH, since we are in a crammed apartment with my wife and kid). I also run the U4919, which is 5120x1440 (just a tad less pixels than in a 4K display), so I need a powerful card to drive it. Therefore the 3080 I was able to get back in September (what an adventure that was, back alley warehouse purchase!) is great for my case.",rx_6000_nov_18

"We won't know for sure until reviews of both cards hit, but historically (ex. looking at the 5700 XTs) the Nitro+ has a slightly higher end cooler, with more generous/aggressive power targets and boost behaviour, but this generally only translates to a maybe 1-2% difference in games. Pulse is still generally a competent card, and last time around (5700 XT generation) was highly recommended as a mid range offering as far as AIB options went.",rx_6000_nov_18
"Last generation, 5700 series, the pulse was the better buy as it had worse cooling, but still was more than enough capable and the boost in frequency was only like a 1-2% gain from going with the Nitro+.

However with a power hungry GPU such as the Vega 64, the Nitro+ card was something like almost 10% ahead iirc, although it may have be OC comparison. I remember it being like a different GPU from other RX Vega 64s.

I'd try and wait for reviews, but if the card you will be needing right away, its not worth gambling before reviews for that small performance gain.",rx_6000_nov_18
I think the best value proposition is 6800 XT at 4K.,rx_6000_nov_18

I'm in a similar situation building a new PC with a 5800x @ 1440p 144hz. Considering carrying over my gtx 1080 until months later when the GPU war gets sorted out and nvidia makes a counter to RDNA2's 16GB VRAM. If CC has stock I'll wait in line then see how the early reviews/weeks are before making a final decision. Otherwise I would prefer to wait since AMD hasn't fully proven themselves yet in the driver/stability department (though they're making great progress).,rx_6000_nov_18

6800xt is more future proof due to 16 gb. But i dont really see a lot of games going to need more than 10 in the next ,w years

Personally, i lean more on the 3080 to be a better card. I bought 6800xt though bc its available, ,i have a freesync monitor, and 5800xt cpu (althought smart access memory does not rrally make a big dent on performance, and nvidia is rumored to have an answer to it)

Either way, as a general user (talking gaming specifically) you probably can't go wrong with either one.  I would say if you can wait, get whatever one is cheaper (probably the 3070).

I play a lot of unoptimized unreal engine games (Assetto Corsa Competizione, Squad), so raw power and vram is way more important to me than raytracing. I already max out the 11gb of VRAM on my 1080ti. There's no way I'm going to buy a card with less VRAM.

"There are some reasonable questions left to be answered over whether or not mid-tier cards even really make sense right now/going forward. 

The current generation of consoles has GPUs better than every mid-tier card ever released, and a heavily downclocked 3700 for its CPU. For $500CAD. Mid-tier PC gaming has lost a lot of viability, because if your PC is worse than the consoles every mainstream game is being designed around...well, what's the point? It's not like you're going to manage a system that compares to that console for less than it, so you're paying more for less. 

It's painful, but it's true. *This* more than anything else, is why the quality of AMD's latest set of GPUs really mattered this time around. If they were shit, cool, we're all good. But they're not, and when availability finally gets sorted out and we have the entire lineup available for all of these architectures we're in for a pretty weird time and it's unclear whether mid-to-low end PC gaming will still have a place in the world.",rx_6000_nov_18

"You don't want to have a 500W with a PC that is using 484W.

Few reason:

* Efficiency is not as good if you PSU is near 100%
* If your PSU is near 100%, the power supply fan can be really loud.
* Maybe you'll block yourself with future yourself, always think about the future.

&#x200B;

Since a PSU will follow you for multiples builds, What I usually recommend is a 750W Gold PSU or a 850W if you can find a good deal.  Nothing below Gold. Full modular with enough PCIe cable. Some motherboard need 2 EPS cable and some graphic card required 3 PCIe cable. 5 is ideal to be future build proof, but 4 is enough.

Ray tracing (RT) is a graphical rendering technique that can enhance lighting and shadow effects in 3D applications by simulating light rays bouncing around a scene. A wide range of free software and commercial software is available for producing ray-traced images. This article lists games that support ray tracing.

Completely depends what resolution you play at. If it's 1080p the 6800 or 3070 is more than enough for you. If you're planning to do 1440p or 4k then the 6800xt and equivalents are for you!,rx_6000_nov_18

"It's not just about power draw. Higher capacity PSUs generally have better transient response behaviour for the same load, which helps with GPU/system stability, and the GPU is less likely to trip protection features. Some overcurrent protections can be sensitive to sudden power draw spikes, even if the spike doesn't put system power draw over the total capacity. A few people have observed the new cards doing this.

Recommending a higher PSU capacity is an easy way to get a (generally) better quality PSU in the system, avoid OCP issues, and without having to explain it all to the customer.",rx_6000_nov_18

It's not at all straightforward for AMD to get enough supply in this COVID era, nor is it viable to just delay until supply chains are back up to speed (whenever that will be).

They partner with companies like Samsung, Microsoft, razr, McAfee, avast, etc. If you buy from those websites, your charge may show up as from digital river. They also handle subscriptions. A lot of times what happens is people accept a free trial for a product, like anti virus, and forget to cancel and it auto renews.

That's only initial when-we-open amount. Based on how AMD CPUs went, they're expecting some additional throughout the day as well. My location confirmed 1 Sapphire reference card, but I didn't ask about the others. 

I'd expect maybe 1-10 cards on launch day for each location. 

It seems a lot of rumors are turning out very close to true. Launch day for reference cards is bad. Better than NV, but barely. But supply should improve as there's going to be substantially more partner custom cards than NV had.",rx_6000_nov_18

"It came out to $1.2k after chipping in a bit extra for expedited shipping. I was comparing it to the 3080s, so it is about $100 less than the premium models. From what I've seen with the latest hardware releases, Newegg tends to mark up the price by about $50 as well.

I can't say if it is worth, but the current stock situation makes it feel like you don't have the luxury to choose, especially if you are looking to finish your build ASAP. For me, I saw the card come up, saw it offered at MSRP (plus the Newegg premium), and jumped the gun.

Regardless though, I'm sure that the both of us, and anyone else fortunate enough to get a card at a fair price, will enjoy it!",rx_6000_nov_18

"""Without DLSS"" is a lot like saying that as long as one racer doesn't use their nitro, the other is right there with them. The problem is that the nitro button exists, and it does get used.

I'm hopeful for AMD. I'm actually really interested in the 6900XT. But they've been very, very slow to roll out any information about their DLSS equivalent. I don't think it's a good idea to assume that - this generation - they will definitely catch up. We don't even know *when* it will be available.

The cost difference is significant so if the 6800 better fits someone's needs, awesome. But for 4k gaming, I stand by me assertion that the 3080 is clearly the better card for most gamers. 

At least until the 6900xt comes out. :D",rx_6000_nov_18

Might be just biased though because I am literally one of those people and if I had to stand in line again that would be kinda bs.

I mean it would be more frustrating to those who waited in line on the initial launch and paid their full deposits to see people get their 6800XT's before they did. Also the reason why I even mentioned them rolling back deposits to AIB cards is because that is what they told us last week they would do. The thing is some CC stores didn't even allow people to backorder and put down deposits last week and told them to come on the 25th to order the card which is causing some confusion on what will be happening.,rx_6000_nov_18

And before someone says the 6800's VRAM is good for 4k, who the fuck is buying a 6800 for 4k? 4k gaming is a meme and the big ballers that do it have a bigger budget than a 6800. 

If AMD didn't have its recently earned reputation of being the underdogs that de-throned intel, this launch would've been an utter failure, less so for the 6800XT and 6900 but the 6800 would've been laughed out of the room. Instead tho, you have fanboys frothing at the mouth about how 16gb vram is so good.",rx_6000_nov_18

I asked the owner of shop. They sent the card by UPS and I will pay the GST and HST. UPS cost me 70 CAD.  After all it is not a good idea for buying from china. but if you really want one for collection it is cheaper than stockX or kijiji.,rx_6000_nov_18

"By all means, if you preordered, you are entitled to a card, full stop. Don't disagree with you at all there.

What I find unfair is that the *existing messaging* was that ""don't preorder now - this is only for reference boards"" so myself and many others ***did not*** place preorders because we were told to come back on the 25th (see image link I posted before). If that now puts us at a disadvantage for AIB cards, that is unfair, because had I (and many others, I'm sure) known that ordering a card would really translate into ordering an AIB card, there would have been many more preorders / interest. I would have definitely preordered! We could have participated in the launch / wait just as you and many others did.

So to me saying ""don't order now this is just reference cards"" and then now coming back and saying ""well actually lol jk you can get your pick of AIBs"" is a bait and switch. No doubt to the advantage of those who ordered, but unfair to those who were told to wait.",rx_6000_nov_18

Oh that's good! So do you have updates for what is happening next?,rx_6000_nov_18
"Haha, I hear you man. I'm GPU-agnostic, I just want the frames. I strongly considered AMD this gen, before finally going with an RTX card. My gaming goals were 4K, VR, and to enjoy ray tracing on certain titles. I know I can get that from the high end Nvidia, but it's not clear AMD can do all of that quite yet.

I do find the new AMD cards to be an impressive leap from RDNA1. I'd love to see them continue that growth with RDNA3 in 12-16 months, and push graphics forward for everyone.

But as you said, I don't see a ton of value in the 6800. The 6800XT does have a nice market spot for 1440p, non-RT gaming. It can sort of work as a budget 4k card too. But in a lot of cases, even a 3090 wants DLSS to push 4k to a place where it's buttery smooth...

"\>  but the customer service was nice enough to send me a replacement and its been 2.5 years no problem with it 

Honestly, that's been my experience with vendors between the low-mid tier and mid-upper tier.

Upper tier cards should not only be more reliable, but should have decent service if there are issues. I won't write off a vendor for a product which has an issue, but I will if they screw me over on said product where it should be under warranty (which is why I avoid MSI these days).",rx_6000_nov_18
