# [Legit Reviews](https://www.legitreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-founders-edition-review_222243)

>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 is the new flagship video card from NVIDIA and hands down is the fastest card that we have ever tested. It is simply the best graphics card on the market today when it comes to performance. It also comes with a sky high price tag of $1,499. That price point is going to put it out of the reach for gamers, but content creators that are familiar with professional workstation card pricing won’t be freaking out over the price tag. This card is aimed at a different crowd and fills that niche very nicely.  
>  
>Using the GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition was a pleasurable experience as it ran cooler and quieter than the GeForce RTX 3080 Founders edition. We were able to crank games like PUBG up on our 4K display with Ultra image quality settings and it actually felt smooth for once. No hitching or micro-stutters were present when we played a few matches online, which was unusual for that game title. It also ripped through the content creation workloads like no other card that we’ve ever tested.Many were expecting the RTX 3090 to trounce the RTX 3080 and while that wasn’t the case it is still an impressive card. At $1499 it will be used by those that have deep pockets and simply want the best. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 is still the card that we’d recommend to strictly gamers as it delivers basically 80-90% of the performance at less than half of the cost of a RTX 3090 card. You really can’t go wrong with either model!

>While the new NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30-series cards are certainly the most powerful GPUs ever released, it is important to understand that different applications utilize the GPU in very different ways.  
>  
>In GPU render engines like OctaneRender, Redshift, and V-Ray, the RTX 3080 and 3090 greatly out-performs the RTX 20-series cards, beating the RTX 2080 Ti (which is significantly more expensive) by a large 60% and 90% respectively. Unreal Engine also saw massive performance gains, averaging 60-80% higher performance gains over the RTX 2080 Ti.  
>  
>Applications that are more CPU-focused like DaVinci Resolve or the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, however, have much more mixed results. In Resolve, the RTX 3080 can still be up to 35% faster than the 2080 Ti in certain situations, while the RTX 3090 is on par with a pair of RTX 2080 Ti cards. However, this drops to just a 10-20% performance gain in Premiere Pro and After Effects. And in Photoshop and Lightroom Classic where GPU acceleration is much less pronounced, there is very little performance gain to be had with either the new RTX 3080 or RTX 3090.  
>  
>One thing to note is that multi-GPU configurations - which can be a major consideration for some of these applications - are still up in the air at the moment. Unlike the previous generation, these new cards (including all the third-party models we have seen so far) do not vent a significant portion of their heat directly outside the chassis which may mean that using more than 2 GPUs will not be feasible without a complex and expensive liquid cooling setup. This is something we will be testing in-depth in the coming weeks and months.",rtx_3090
Gamer Nexus absolutely destroyed the 3090 lol. No mercy shown.,rtx_3090
"I'm really curious why Nvidia didn't go with Titan branding for the 3090. Titan has always been a weird blurry line between workstation and gaming, and the 3090 just makes that line even blurrier. It honestly kinda feels like Nvidia thinks that they can squeeze money from gamers who want the best, regardless of cost, and to be fair they probably can - but it feels a little sleazy to attach a gaming brand and place so much emphasis in the marketing on gaming performance, given the very poor price to performance angle in that area.

I guess the reality is that the market of gamers with deep pockets is larger than the market of creative professionals who actually _need_ that amount of power, and so marketing to them is still an effective way to ship units. I just wish they were a little more honest about who benefits from tech like this.

P.S. That babeltechreview is pretty poorly written and really misguided in a lot of its conclusions, IMHO. Bummer.",rtx_3090
Is there anything about VR performance? I would like to see how it stacks up against the 3080,rtx_3090
"There is literally no room for a 3080 Ti or a 20GB 3080. I kept going off in this sub about how the 3090 had to be at least 30% faster than the 3080 because there had to be room to slot in one of the Ti or 20GB. Well, I died on that hill. 

They’ll probably still release one of the two at some point, but at what performance gain and at what cost. Two possible scenarios? It’s almost as fast, if not as fast, as the 3090. We get a 5-8% gain for a considerable price jump. 

There is an option 3 that I don’t even want to consider. Still only 5-8% increase, but they keep the $700 pricing, which again fucks over early adopters.",rtx_3090
"So my question and I believe this is where u/i_seen was gong as well.

It doesn't seem there's really any improvement room between a 3080 and 3090 to make releasing a 3080 TI / Super beneficial.

Granted they can add some more vram, but everything says that doesn't really matter. I have seen nothing in the current reviews that shows a notable improvement can be had by doing a ti / super modle of the 3080 based off of the differences between the 3080/3090.

&#x200B;

There's a big price difference in there, but doesn't seem to be a big performance difference outside of workstation style apps.",rtx_3090
Pugey Systems's articles are also all up - focusing purely on workstation performance. https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3080-10GB-RTX-3090-24GB-Review-Roundup-1899/,rtx_3090
"Gamers Nexus' video is the best on this chart by far. FFS NVIDIA just give us a 20GB RTX 3080 already, and let 3090 for content creators.",rtx_3090
"Im somewhat glad I overslept the launch by a few minutes. I was falling into the ""It'll be good for years"" trap, but realized a going 3080->4080 will likely be cheaper than $1800.",rtx_3090
"I snagged a 3090, I know it’s not crazy fast but if I don’t have the biggest e peen what’s the point of life?",rtx_3090
Everyone should watch first 5 minutes of Gamers Nexus' video.,rtx_3090
"I wonder if they put 10gb on 3080 to ""limit"" it so it couldn't run 8k?  That way the 3090 could differentiate itself. Seems like a very artificial gddr size for this generation.",rtx_3090
As if reviews matter when the card doesn’t actually exist lmao,rtx_3090
"Gamers Nexus basically says all you need to know. If you're looking for gaming, it's only better at 4k and above. The ""8k"" marketing is mostly bullcrap, as most of the games will have dips into single digit FPS constantly. 

At 4k, you might get 15% at best. Often the difference is smaller, and an OC'd 3080 gets within a few FPS of the stock 3090.

SO, yes, it's the best thing available. The premium is crazy, if this is a ""gaming"" card. If you using for production work, perhaps its worthwhile.",rtx_3090
I was able to grab one off EVGA due to them only selling it to exclusive members.,rtx_3090
"Why are we not seeing any 3090 Overclocks in reviews? Seeing reviews with the 3080 OC'd to  close the gap with the 3090, but it would be nice to see the OC performance.",rtx_3090
Can some do an average of the performance summary for all reviews?,rtx_3090
"I predict you will be able to order one of these online easily within 30 days.  The only reason I feel I might be wrong is I am underestimating people who might still want it for workstation duties, even though it has no SRV-IO or Titan class features.",rtx_3090

"I got the **Gigabyte RTX 3080 Eagle OC** and mine was dead on arrival. Plugged it in, no picture, just beeping from the mainboard. I tried a lot, different PSU, different wires, different PCI-E, UEFI Upgrade etc pp.

Turned out, 2 of the 12V PINs where pushed in / poorly fabricated. 

So I had to make the call, returning it or fixing it myself. I went for fixing myself due to the long waiting queue.  
I opened up the cooler and saw, that the PINS weren't even fixed on the PCB, insted, in a seperate box just crimped wires on a Molex (or whatever it was called). I fiddled with it made the wire stick but no avail. 

I ended up using a multimeter, checking 12V and GND on each PIN. I assume, while I was doing that, I must have created contact and the card works now.

Here are some picture from this operation: [https://imgur.com/a/lA4jmkh](https://imgur.com/a/lA4jmkh)

Yes, I void warrenties.

Would not recommend the Gigabyte card due to this cheap ass 12V connector block! It even comes with 0 accessories. Not even a power adapter. Noting. Just the plain card and a 1 side outdated instruction manual. 

**2/10  DO NOT BUY**",rtx_3090
"Só here in Brazil I have 2 options, can you guys help me decide?

Asus TUF and Evga XC3 ultra 

Wich one should I get? Same price for both 

Thanks",rtx_3090
"this is an irrelevant and random opinion, but does anyone think the big ass RGB bar on the FTW3 is uglier than the red accent?",rtx_3090
"Is there any possibility that driver updates, and further game development for the cards will  either widen or close the gap between the 3080 and 3090?",rtx_3090
"As expected, the 3090 has the worst performance per dollar of any modern GPU, and that was at MSRP before retailer/scalper mark-ups.",rtx_3090
"Bummer. Glad I couldn’t get one to some degree but now I’m not sure what to do. 

I don’t see where a 3080ti would fit into the lineup and it wouldn’t make sense to gimp the 3090 by releasing a 3080ti that’s faster. 

Looks like I’ll be waiting until the 40 series?",rtx_3090
"Tl;dr - If you have an obscene amount of disposable income or are a professional, go ahead and buy this card.  But for 99% of gamers, it's a giant waste of money over the 3080.",rtx_3090
"nice, seems the strix 3090 is a great card, let's hope that translates well to the 3080 (I mean everything but the chip and memory should be the same) and I'm extremely happy with my pre-order :D",rtx_3090
"If you're the type that wants maximum possible performance regardless of price it seems like the Strix is the one to go for. The TPU review mentions that ASUS says they haven't fully locked in a price yet, but retailers currently have a $1800 placeholder price and it would not surprise me one bit if that's what they actually sell at. 480W max power limit, high quality PCB and Strix cards always have a good selection of waterblocks. If you're in for this much cash already then watercooling would be the move, you should be able to get a decent (for Ampere) overclock and high sustained clocks.",rtx_3090
"The 3090 doesn't even include workstation driver optimisation, so the 3090 isn't even a workstation card.

I have no idea why NVIDIA even made this thing.

This just leaves more questions around what the 20 GB 3080 will cost. If the 3090 is double the price its not because it's a workstation card, that must mean it's double the price because of the higher v ram. So how are they going to make a 3080 with 20 GB v ram reasonably priced while still making the 3090 relevant.",rtx_3090
"In other words, just stick with the 3080, got it.",rtx_3090
Any ultrawide benchmarks?,rtx_3090
"I got 3090 and 1080p

gotta get dat sweet 1500 fps in cs 1.6",rtx_3090
"Thanks for posting the sticky! Mostly curious to see how the workstation performance is, I don't really expect a large leap for gaming since the biggest difference from the 3080 to the 3090 is the VRAM Capacity and that's very, very rarely a limiting factor in gaming. I mean, besides 8K, but I don't have the resources to get an 8k monitor.",rtx_3090
"Has anyone gotten a confirmation email? I made it all the way through to purchasing a 3090 FE this morning but no email from them, not even in spam.",rtx_3090

"Does anyone have any good knowledge about how good the 3090 is for ML? Are there any reviews by people that know this stuff? I'm wanting to do more deep learning and GANs in particular. I've been very limited with StyleGAN on my 1080, presumably due to RAM limitations. I thought the 3090 would be the perfect upgrade, but I'm seeing comments by some that it has been purposefully gimped to not be as good as the Titan or Quadro for some AI tasks. I know more about the math than the hardware though.",rtx_3090
Any over clock benchmarks comparing an OC’d 3090 TUF to an OC’d 3080?,rtx_3090
"There's some available at my MicroCenter right now but I can't bring myself to justify the price when I can get basically an Xbox Series X, a PS5, and a RTX 3080 for about the price of one 3090.",rtx_3090
"TBH I can't believe I was considering buying a 3090. Performance improvements over the 3080 seem to be in the 10-15% range on average which doesn't really justify the more than doubling of price (here in Australia) to me. I've got the money to spend, but I'm not a moron. I might've considered it more seriously if in gaming tasks it was more like a 30-40% improvement but I never really expected it to be that much better (but I was hoping).

Since hearing about the 3080 20gb model, I'm somewhat glad I didn't get the FE of it. I think I'll wait for when the 20gb models come out and try and score one then. The 3090 seems like an utterly useless card and probably serves as an incentive to buy the 3080 20gb model as people will see its obscene price as ""value"" over the 3090. I know there's some marketing term for this gimmick, but I can't recall what they call it.",rtx_3090

Where do I get a 3090 in Canada? I have 3k to spend,rtx_3090
So am I right in thinking the 3090 is a bit of a dud for gaming? Glad I went with a 3080 + monitor upgrade now instead of going all in on the 3090 as initially planned.,rtx_3090
It was already known for awhile to be ~10% better than the 3080 for double the price. I am surprised at how many people are just learning this now. Enthusiast card for people willing to pay alot extra for minimal gains for the novelty of having the fastest card out there.,rtx_3090

"I am not into conspiracy theories or anything, but the way this looks, seems that Intel and Nvidia are adopting some scummy marketing tactics. For the launch, they just produce enough parts for media, youtubers, etc. Then they hype the product, and since only a few parts were produced, there is no stock. Between the hype and the scarcity the price goes up. Then eventually they release more parts with a significant markup.

Intel did the same but they actually got real manufacturing problems to keep the demand even a few months later, but for Nvidia I think is artificial scarcity. Just my opinion.",rtx_3090

"Okay, so I'm checking out 3090 reviews as a video editor, and I'm not seeing anything for me, even though everyone is in agreement that is great for productivity.  

The Puget System benchmarks show the 3080 and 3090 basically the same in Premiere and Resolve. Awesome, at least some data. The YouTube reviews are focusing on one thing: showing how shitty 3090 price to performance is for gaming, then saying the card is great for people like them, without posting any of those benchmarks..  

Hardware Canucks basically shits on the card for gaming (rightfully so), then says it's important to his workflow, but literally not even a single rendering time benchmark.  

Anyone seeing reviews that touch on this? I'd hoped Linus or MKBHD would mention it, because they have in previous content, but they just played video games (poorly) in 8K.",rtx_3090
I was able to get a Asus Tuf 3090 I'm only able to get a +80 core boost and am constantly at power limit hitting voltage limit here and there. Msi Afterburner only allows 107% power limit which might be the limit of the 2 x 8pin. (I'm unsure of this but if someone know please let me know). I'm quite disappointed with the overclock results I was only able to get up to 10500 GPU score on time spy extreme.

"You've already received plenty of replies similar to what I've written below, but here they are anyways because I spent a good chunk of time writing them out. So here's a few reasons I can think of why Nvidia didn't go with ""Titan"":

* Nvidia knew they'd be competing with 2020 being a new console/gpu gen release year. So while they satisfy the average consumer with 499 and 699 options, adding in the ""top tier"" 3090 at $1499 was simply their way to predetermine their positioning in the next gen arena ahead of any other releases. Titan was intended to be marketed in a gray area between gaming and productivity, but it was simply priced as an entry-level productivity board. So, in a way, the 3090 exists partially for Nvidia to flex while also staying competitive.

* Classifying the 3090 as a gaming card is probably an easier story to market than to have press releases go out saying *the 3070/3080 are gaming cards, but the 3090 (which looks suuuper similar) is a workstation card*.

* The ""Titan"" name could have a negative connotation with what consumers got at the steep price point in 2018.

* Also FOMO. If Nvidia had gone to market saying the 3090 is a productivity card and they also priced it similar to last gen's Titan (at $2,499), consumers wouldn't be so ravenous at wanting to get one. But because it's an ""8K"" gaming card, you immediately get *all* interested parties with deep pockets perked up about it. This could also ensure Nvidia hits their coronavirus-ravaged Q4 earnings to satisfy their shareholders.",rtx_3090
"This is kind of letting you know that the 3090 (titan) is the early adopter fee for the 3080Ti. They laid it out more clearly this time.

you can see some of that mentioned here: https://youtu.be/YjcxrfEVhc8?t=593

just because it has more ram, doesn't make it a titan. On some benchmarks, the titan is over 500% faster than the 3090",rtx_3090
">It honestly kinda feels like Nvidia thinks that they can squeeze money from gamers who want the best

Yeah it must be this. I've fallen into the trap and as a 1080ti then 2080ti owner, just initially said ""cool guess I'll get a 3090"".   But now I'm kind of on the fence. On one hand, I can afford it and at least if I get it won't feel dumb when the 3080S or whatever comes out with more memory. On the other hand, it seems Tha toying twice the money for 15% speed, that isn't even really needed even for 4k or VR, is just dumb. 

But Nvidia got me with the 3090 naming.  If it were a titan I'd have said initially ""I never get the titan, it's a workstation card"".",rtx_3090

"I was near that mark as well. Based on numbers and power limits I was guessing around 20-25% additional performance. Then the Ti would essentially be a the full fat chip but with a lower power limit, so around 10-15% performance.

My guess is the next GPUs will be the ""super"" series. Once they get the manufacturing process down they will start pushing clock speed up and get a 5-10% performance boost.

Unless they can pull off some magic...I don't see a Ti series. UNLESS they are specifically binning chips that reach higher clock speed and slapping more vram on and calling that Ti.",rtx_3090

20 gb VRAM is more usable for a content creator though? I think people are overstating how much of an improvement that would be for gaming.,rtx_3090

"Literally a Titan in everything but name but then it sucks at Titan specific tasks.  Complete waste of money for 99.9% of users.  I see other reviewers calling it the flagship for gaming but that's just inaccurate IMO especially since Jensen literally called the 3080 the flagship card.  Stick to the 3080.  All I know is, it looks like I'm going to be sticking with my 1080 ti for a while longer since there's 0 chance I'll ever have the opportunity to get a 3080 since I work 8-5 M-F.",rtx_3090

Soo the 3090 is the new quadro?,rtx_3090
yeah man glad I got a 3080 last night incase I couldn't get a 3090. The performance jump for the cost is terrible even compared to the 2080 ti vs 2080. Much rather spend half and upgrade again whenever the 4000's come out in 2-3yrs.,rtx_3090

They also did it to have their next gen in the market before AMD delivers and have an option to release something after AMD delivered. That way they have every option and already a big piece of the cake called nerds,rtx_3090
"Just look at the PCB: https://tpucdn.com/gpu-specs/images/c/3621-pcb-front.jpg

There is literally two memory modules missing. It's clear to me the RTX 3080 was intended to be a 12GB card but NVIDIA changed their mind to give it 1GB less memory than the $1100-$1200 RTX 2080 Ti hoping some of those people would instead upgrade to the RTX 3090 which provides 24GB of memory, 12 modules on either side of the PCB.

They for sure limited it. 12GB like the PCB allows for would have been a nice upgrade in my opinion, either that or 16GB.",rtx_3090
It's because vram is expensive.,rtx_3090
"Dude, memory costs...The 3080 would have been hundreds of dollars more expensive with more memory",rtx_3090
"I honestly think they did it to save money off the card. That extra Vram will push that card at least 150-200 dollars. And like they said most games at 1440p or 4k hover around 4-6gb of actual vram use.

They just wanted the card to look like a good deal. Once AMD announced their cards you will see a whole series of 20gb cards",rtx_3090

"We need a ""One quarter later"" follow-up, especially because Ampere's just getting compared to Turing most of the time right now, not RDNA2. The real war will start in December (to me, at least), as by that point the consoles can be benched against Sequel Navi and RTX 3000.",rtx_3090

That being said, the 20gb 3080 does render a lot of its arguments pretty moot. My guess, wishful thinking, is they might roll out driver optimizations for it AFTER the 3080ti/super drops in order to keep it competitive.",rtx_3090

Buying for 1440p is stupid, but if you consider it for 4K and then say im using OLED for my monitor, i have HDMI 2.1, so with these cards i get 4K/120hz mode unlocked on my tv.                     

Now if you look at the FPS of 3090, it basically takes you to next step, so you always above 60fps and in some games doing above 100.                   

In some games the 3080 was like 58FPS, 56fps in 4k and that 3090 takes you above that to guaranteed 60fps area

I think if it wasn't for AMD's pending announcements and subsequent drops, they would have announced the 30 series as they did, but only released it around early-mid November to build up stock - because fun fact, not selling any cards at all will cost them more than they'd make with the theoretical markup.

Some of this idea is supported by the partner cards, which do traditionally come out in staggered release windows but are not typically this badly handled.",rtx_3090

His TLDR, rendering/export times are only marginally faster than 3080. Additional vram can be beneficial for working with very large projects using high-res video and effects, but this use case is hard to benchmark/test for. Essentially if you make money off of your machine and regularly find yourself running out of vram while editing it might be worth it, otherwise hard to justify over 3080.",rtx_3090
This card is not great for productivity because it is not possible for something to be productive if it does not exist.,rtx_3090
"I’m no overclocker, only a PC enthusiast, but I’d done quite a bit of reading in preparation for the 3090 launch. From what I gather, your 8-pins are rated for 150w each and the pcie 4.0 is 75w giving a total power of 375w for 2 x 8-pin cards. 

I can’t give you the source, but I think I remember certain 3080 cards drawing up to 440w with most capping out at 380w. 380w makes sense; it’s probably within error/variation for the max that two 8-pins can provide. Also supporting this is your 107% power limit - 107% of 350w (what the 3090 is rated at) is 375w. 

At launch I somehow managed to get the strix and the TUF in my basket. I had to choose one or the other to checkout. I ended up going with the strix because while the TUF is the best value 3080 imo, I worried two 8-pins wouldn’t fully utilise the capability of the card. From the one review of the strix online now ([techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asus-geforce-rtx-3090-strix-oc/30.html)) it records the strix pulling 480w and it seems ASUS has really relaxed the power limit to let the 3090 shine. 

Don’t be too disappointed though. For all that extra power available to the strix, the review says it only gains 3.4%. It looks like this generation is already running near its max at stock. To get any meaningful overclock it seems serious modding and LN2 cooling is needed.",rtx_3090
"This isn't just an issue with Asus, it's almost every AIB for the most part.  Even the Gaming X Trio w/ 3 x 8 pin runs into the same issue.   EVGA did say the FTW Ultra will go to 440W.

The only card I know of that lets you go above this threshold is the FE, which caps at about 127%.  Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.",rtx_3090

To be fair, it's still a pole vault -- we have no idea what other features Big Navi will bring that can sway people to a 6900XT (do they have ultra-sampling features?

"Absolutely not.  Lots of shader models run twice in VR (once for each eye) and take up double the VRAM space in addition to the resolution increase.  Supersampling most games (well above 4K effectively) is an extremely common configuration to get around the current crop of VR HMD’s limited angular resolution.  Stereo rendering in popular games converted for VR like Elite, Skyrim is janky and doesn’t scale the same way resolution does.

Effectively the question as to whether 24GB is any advantage vs 10GB for VR is still unanswered by any of these reviews, and we‘ve seen the 3090 scale better vs the 3080 at higher resolutions, which could theoretically continue at the effective higher resolutions in VR.

There are hundreds of thousands of PC VR players in the world, but reviewers were so eager to jump down Nvidia's throat about their shitty '8k' marketing that those reviewers neglected the main demographic that this GPU maybe makes sense for, which is ridiculous.

I concur Doctor.,rtx_3090
"Depends on who you are.

I'm having allocation issues on a nearly daily basis on my 1080Ti at 11GB, to the point where it starts thrashing and my frames tank in VR, where supersampling is really useful and things like VRC exist. When this happens, I'll suddenly tank from a reasonable framerate down to sub-10. 

I also do content creation, but I can have allocation issues even without any of that open. 

A 10GB card is a non-starter for me since I'm already running out at 11GB. My options for an upgrade path are a 3090 or waiting for a 20GB 3080. I'm undecided at this point.",rtx_3090

It would only have a bigger number on the box and satiate people who think that 10GB is going to limit 3080 in the future despite all evidence pointing to the fact that by the time 20GB of VRAM is relevant to gaming performance you're going to be limited by shaders and clocks. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me personally. I know that some AIBs have leaked a 20GB on their roadmaps but it isn't something I would personally feel like is worth waiting for.

I think what would make sense to me would be a 3080Ti (or S) 6-12 months from now when the process has improved yields that has more SMs alongside the extra VRAM that would match the 3090 in gaming perf for less money. That would fit the traditional model of a Titan (class) card being launched first and then a Ti some time later that's a better buy for pure gaming.",rtx_3090

In any case, I'm holding off for more than one reason. Aside from this model potentially coming out, I also know AMD are releasing a new card and I'm waiting to see what its performance is like and what NVIDIA's response is. Worst case scenario, I still get the 3080, but more than likely there'll be some sort of competitive move by NVIDIA if AMD produce a decent enough card (cheaper prices, new model etc).

>The RTX 3090 doesn’t offer any certifications for professional applications and it is not expected to be certified for them.  It is expected that in workstation specific benchmarks, there will be cases where a TITAN, and especially a Quadro board, will outperform the GeForce class RTX 3080/3090 boards.",rtx_3090

The 3090 is for creators who need an 24GB memory buffer.  Not for workstation, pro apps, or for scientific apps - period.  It's also Nvidia's flagship gaming card.",rtx_3090

">Absolutely not. Lots of shader models run twice in VR (once for each eye) and take up double the VRAM space in addition to the resolution increase. Supersampling most games (well above 4K effectively) is an extremely common configuration to get around the current crop of VR HMD’s limited angular resolution. Stereo rendering in popular games converted for VR like Elite, Skyrim is janky and doesn’t scale the same way resolution does.

In addition to this, the effective view frustum is much wider, meaning you have more scene traversal going on and more rendered objects in frame as well.

Some engines (UE4) have instanced stereo rendering to prevent things from having to be fully run twice, but not all do, so the performance picture is even murkier. Not to mention things like static (or even dynamic, but I think only Pimax has that right now) foveated rendering.",rtx_3090

The answer to the is 10GB enough question is easy, because it is a blatant no. Normal games are already starting push the 8GB mark at 4k: i.e. you will get non negligible fps loss. Easiest way to see this is looking at the 1080Ti (11GB) vs the 2070 super / 2080 super. The 1080Ti starts to perform closer to the 2080s in memory intense games.

"Yeah I suppose absurdly huge mod lists theoretically could eat up VRAM but you'd be surprised how far 10Gb gets you... and if you're going by VRAM alotment based on a software program it's probably not true utilization.

For instance, a benchmark might say it's requesting 9997MbVRAM when it's actually using 6800 (this is the case for Doom Eternal's Ultra Nightmare texture setting, which to my knowledge outside of FS2020 is the most demanding VRAM game stock).

I run a LOT of 4K texture packs for just about everything you can imagine (I believe I have around 120 visual mods at the moment and ALWAYS pick the highest texture options) running at 1440p. And with my 970 and an i7-4790k, I pretty reliably get 60FPS with a non-demanding ENB on. With a demanding ENB it drops more to the high 40's mid 50's, which is still not bad. And that's with 3.5Gb!",rtx_3090

"If you have a 2080Ti now then it probably isn't worth it, honestly. A 2080Ti is still a solid card. That makes more sense to me, I didn't realize you had such a recent card. That would indeed make the 30 series less appealing, no big call to upgrade as of yet. Maybe wait for the supers.

Im also in same situation as you, i had 2080ti and used to buy the top model, always had, so my mind tells me get the 3090, but now with all the issues and rumors about not worthless AMD, im thinking to maybe i should wait and see what AMD has and what nvidia does about fixing, im on iGPU now but for 2D im still doing 4K/60hz and watching 4K yt videos, even watched 8K YT video and it run smooth no issues on the iGPU \[10700K\].                                     

On the other hand, logic tells me if AMD had good performing GPU, they would be HAPPY to ruin nvidia launch \[so many people buying its out of stock everywhere\] by showing at least some official benchmarks to reduce the nvidia hype and generate some of their own.                                

But not only there are no benchmarks, the announcement is almost 1 month away from nvidia launch.



There are no rumors about 3080Ti, we have leaked info from Gigabyte about actual future models, like 3070Ti, 16GB, 3060Ti, 3080 20Gb, but not a single rumor about 3080Ti.                                

BTW, also if AMD can show at least some fight, say they surprise us with near 3080 performance, nvidia will have to fight it, either by lowering prices or by introducing better models, then all early adopters \[especially the ebay wallets\] going to cry.                              



BTW, when Pascal came out, i heard about 1080Ti, but went ahead with 1080 because i already sold my 980TI, then when 1080Ti came out i actually managed to sell my 1080 for same or tad more money then i paid for it, so honestly getting RTX3080 now and then if 3080Ti comes out is something im considering, the only thing that can ruin my plan is if AMD has good GPU and nvidia lowers prices, then ill loose a lot when i re-sell almost brand new 2-3 months old RTX3080",rtx_3090

"It really is hard to resist.

OTOH, the 3090 does have SLI, but OTOH it appears it will only work going forward with DX12, so likely not worth having SLI anymore.

Aside from that - what is the % difference for professional workloads?  Because most of the people purchasing a 3090 couldn't care less about it's gaming performance over a 3080.

The 3090 (by Nvidia's own admission) is for people who need their GPU for work and also game in their free time.  If you buy this card for professional use, it's a huge bargain.

GPUs aren't just for gaming, ya know.  Some people (like myself) require very powerful GPUs for rendering, AI, CAD, etc.  These people don't just sit at home all day playing video games.  Go look up professional grade GPUs and tell me how much they are, then compare their performance to the 3090.  You'll quickly see why the 3090 is very intriguing for that crowd.",rtx_3090

You can look at the chips last gen to figure out real quick 3090 isn't a 2080 ti replacement. The 3080 is.   


The 3090 may or may not be a full titan replacement, depends on if there's a GA102-400 hiding out somewhere or if they bust out a cut down GA100 (unlikely). They may also save the couple of SMs for a 3090 ti/super, or that could end up being a refresh.  


Titan RTX: TU102-400 (full chip, 754mm\^2 die size)  
2080 ti: TU102-300 (cut down/not good enough to be a TU102-400)  
2080: TU104-400 (545mm\^2 die size)  
2080 Super: TU104-450 (improved TU104)  


(No GAXXX-400 skus this go around, as far as we know. Those might shake out to be refreshes late next year or early 2022)

3090: GA-102-300 (near full chip, short couple SMs and I think RTX and tensor cores. 628.4mm\^2 die size)  
3080: GA102-200 (cut down/not good enough to be a GA102-400)  
3070: GA104-300 (392.5mm\^2 die size).",rtx_3090
"Titan was also not really marketed strictly as a workstation card, that's where Quadro is positioned. You can see this even on existing marketing pages for old Titan variants, which market themselves for gamers and creators (and in some newer scenarios, researchers).

Exactly this. The 3080 will be great for a while but there will be lager texture packs coming due to the new consoles being able to handle them and I foresee VRAM being more and more important moving forward.

We're not seeing it play out that way much with the 3090.

I understand it'd be better for games in the long term, but that wouldn't solve their benchmarks problem if Big Navi comes out strong, say similar performance at lower price + power, which is potentially possible with 7nm being mature now.

Maybe more VRAM can help, but thinking about it again now they'd also have to increase the price too which would might undermine say a Super version that might compete if Big Navi were to top the 3080.",rtx_3090

Honestly an extra £150-200 for the 20gb fe is a ok for me because I will use it. I mean Skyrim takes up atleast 80% of my gaming time and I have 7000 hours sunk into it, so I base my purchasing on that and other games are an ""oh well thats nice"" bonus.",rtx_3090

If it is they're clearly not marketing it as a professional card, they're even marketing it for 8k gaming, which it's pretty crap at. DLSS performs better, but that's not really 8k.

"It appears that you are catching on :)  *Read* some reviews - like TechGage - that explore it in depth. We all came to the same conclusion.

And yes, I personally am expecting a Titan replacement for the RTX Titan - the 3090 falls very short in that regard.  The Ampere Titan will probably come equipped with 48GB vRAM - just like the Quadro 7000 that many are also expecting.

My 2080ti struggled on some games with heavy detail like Project Cars and I’m curious if it was due to the 11GB of VRAM.

Edit: Researching more so, people with 2080ti nearly hit the Vram limit on high demanding games so this could be where the 3090 is a solid use case.",rtx_3090

"Yeah I really hate that as well. The 3090 is objectively the best gaming GPU right now, but unless your budget is not a limitation or someone else is covering the cost of the upgrade, it just doesn't seem worth it. The GPU is intentionally held back through a lack of driver optimizations for productivity rather than gaming.

It feels like the card could have been closer to a Titan without altering any of the hardware.",rtx_3090

"We don’t know unit pricing for GDDR6X memory modules, but high speed G6 is around the $8-9 per gigabyte mark.

If we assume G6X is $15 per gig, that’s an extra $210 over the 3080, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see a $999 price point for the 20GB 3080, and that’s assuming vram is the only thing they change.

Went through check out. Got like 20+ object and other random code errors when trying to verify the address. That took like 6-7 min. then I got to payment and went through Affirm. Thankfully I was already preapproved so I chose the finance terms and it sent me back. Had to fill out a captcha and then hit place order. It spun on that for like 5 minutes and then stopped but no success. I was freaking out. I hit place order probably every 20 seconds for a few minutes and then eventually I got a confirmation email. Yesterday I couldn't even get pages to load or get a cart. Just crash after crash. I think them adding Captchas to checkout and soft banning too fast of refresh rate knocked away some of the bots. They also gated the FTW behind Elite Membership for the first like 30 min. Definitely not the smoothest launch but I will say it was better than the 3080 by a long shot.

I wouldn't be surprised if we're running similar mods otherwise and that puts me to 3.5Gb, and the remaining 6.5+Gb is ENTIRELY LOD stuff that you have, hahaha. But hey, if it's worth it to you, then it's worth it! It definitely does feel good to have a cohesive visual experience, the original LOD stuff really does look horrific. I did load in some custom LOD stuff but it's not 4k, I staged it to look about as ""distant"" as the other LOD stuff I have so it's not jarring. That's probably the only texture I didn't max.",rtx_3090
"Interesting. I'm curious just how many mods you have installed, because even with a massive amount of them, my ooooooold 3.5Gb card doesn't struggle too much. I'm wondering if something else is going on. But! Fair enough. 

Yeah that's fair. I mean, it's always best to assess your use case and buy based on that, nothing wrong with that. I don't think it'll be only 150-200 more unless it's a while before it releases. If it really is 20Gb of GDDR6x (some rumors say it'll be GDDR6 standard, which I REALLY hope isn't the case) then that's only 4Gb less than the $1500 RTX3090, so they'd be massively cutting into their sales. I'd guess it'll probably be a $1200MSRP and be called the 3080Ti. That'd put it in line with the price of the 2080Ti and wouldn't cut into their 3090 sales too heavily.",rtx_3090

The supply curve for these products is negotiated with TSMC and Samsung up to two years in advance of the product release to allocate factory space and boosting production isnt really something that can be done quickly. And well, no one saw 2020 coming in 2018, not to mention that TSMC is already behind in manufacturing AMD CPU's and it has to produce for two next gen consoles as well as the AMD pc chips, and it looks like all three GPU's are using the same architecture.

The price of the 3090 is dictated by the massive amount of DDR6X that it has. It's not just an expensive Ti... its a whole different product skew, that honestly... no one should be buying.

The 3080 Ti or Super version will come out eventually with a marginal performance increase and either 16 or 20 GB ram. That's the card people should be looking for if they want the best of this generation.

It was inefficient and the 3rd and 4th card barely scaled, and the frametimes were a horrible micro-stuttering mess even though the average FPS was high.

I reviewed it in a massive full tower case - and it kept my house nice and toasty in the Winter.  We used to joke about plugging the cards directly into the wall then.   Of course, we were joking - and it's a very old joke.  Doubtful it will happen again.",rtx_3090

How much higher? If they're not changing the architecture at all then that's simply the difference between an XC3 Gaming and XC3 Ultra Gaming. I can raise the core and boost clock on my current card by 50mhz and claim that it performs better too. 

>If you think that the 10gb version will perform the same as the 20gb version then you are in for a surprise.

I'd try to find one of the places that are allowing pre-orders like Tiger Direct and just put yourself in the queue while you wait. If worst comes to worst you're somewhere on a waiting list. 

Then I'd check Microcenter every morning at opening if possible (people are having luck with that since you can only buy in person). Aside from that, Newegg seems to give the best odds with their bot security. 

Also, keep an eye on B&H in NYC. They just added bot protection as well and they tend to do things differently than most sites which will allow for some extra chances at cards that come into stock.

I'll do bullet points so you can try to absorb a little easier. I've heard people who aren't so sharp find them easier to take in.

You can check my previous comments and confirm the following things:

1. I've already said creatives, which includes 3D designers who use things like Maya, will see a benefit.
1. You said CAD, not me, I'm separating CAD from creative, because CAD is not considered ""creative"", it's more industrial than that. 
1. There's one paragraph about ""creatives"" with one line (3d) that ISN'T related to gaming, and that line includes livestreaming, which IS mainly a gaming thing.
1. There's not a single word about industrial stuff, like CAD, because there's little benefit on CAD as I've already explained.
1. To finish with the strongest thing that suggests this marketing is aimed at gaming: **The entire rest of the page is gaming stuff.**
