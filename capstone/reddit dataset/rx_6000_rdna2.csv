As for RTX, which people keep claiming is Nvidias advantage. You do realize that AMDs ray tracing tech is literally the industry standard now that their proprietary hardware is in every console, right? That will likely give them the  long term edge in performance tuning and compatibility.

I was all ready to jump ship this gen after a disappointing few years. They may have redeemed a customer. Really still shocked about it all.

"**16GB Standard**, *across the whole Radeon 6000 Series seems AMAZING!*

This seems like a bold architecture decision, and I'd love to know what the logic was behind it.  Does this simplify things for driver and game development?  Is this something that console developers asked for?  Does this allow for easier testing and development for the consoles?

It seems like a really interesting point to drill into.

With NVIDIA they used the 8GB, 10GB, 11GB, and 24GB to product segment the cards between gamers and developers.  There are Machine Learning Models and Professional workflows that require 11GB+ and only work on 24GB at full speed, so it's a huge product segmented to them.  Also, I think the GDDR6x is really power hungry and puts off a lot of heat, so smaller memory sizes allow for more reasonable coolers.

By Contrast it seems like AMD Radeon 6000 cards are not as power and heat constrained as NVIDIA cards.  It really makes me think the TSMC 7nm process might be better than the Samsung 8nm process.  They both have about 28 Billion Transistors ( 6900 XT has 27 Billion ), but the Navi 21 XTX has a much smaller Die Size of 536mm vs. the  GA102-300-A1 that has a die size of 628mm.  This leads me to believe that the complexity of these chips is about the same, but the TSMC 7nm process is better and smaller, so AMD has a better thermal budget.",rx_6000_rdna2
"The 6900XT beating the 3090 was unexpected and 6800XT performance also looks good. No raytracing performance was shown, however, and AMD has shown, with Ryzen 5000, that it will raise its prices above the competition if it achieves leadership performance. With the 6800XT priced below the 3080, I expect some ‚Äúextra‚Äù features to be noticeably worse (raytracing, upscaling, video encoder, etc.). With all of that said, it‚Äôs still good to see AMD back in the high-end graphics space.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Lower power with smaller form factor, the SFF might be saved by AMD. 

Price looks good for 6800XT for me. 6900XT is just too high to justify for me but it competes with RTX3090 anyway (999 EUR vs 1500 EUR!). I hope for a good driver next!",rx_6000_rdna2

"So I guess the matchups (with MSRP) are:

RTX 3070\* ($499) vs RX 6800 ($579)

RTX 3080 ($699) vs RX 6800 XT ($649)

RTX 3090 ($1499) vs RX 6900 XT ($999)

&#x200B;

It seems like on the mid and high, NVidia has AMD beat in price, so performance would have to be better. On the ultra-high end, that's a $500 difference so even if the performance is roughly equal, AMD still wins.

"6800 XT seems like a solid product at 649. However I feel the 6900 XT slide is suspect. Why are there no numbers on the 3090?  


Theoretically, the 6900 XT 80CU vs 72CU for the 6800 XT so it is at max 10% or so better. Linear scaling with same clocks is almost impossible with such wide GPUs.  


Especially when the 3090 is an additional 25% extra resources compared to the 3080 and it yields around 10-15% better.  


Also why are there no RT benchmarks. Are they so far back on it that they don't wish to show the same?  


I'd wait for the reviews to hit before putting any money down - especially for the 6900 XT. The 6800/6800 XT are nice cards though but the price difference between the 6800 XT and the 6800 is too small to make the 6800 relevant.",rx_6000_rdna2

6800 XT was really good as well but i was expecting it at $600 but it's still good enough and should sell like a hotcake as long as it is actually available on stock.

And the 6800 was a bit more expensive in my opinion. I was expecting it at same 3070 pricing but we got $580 which is a bit more compared to 3070.

Overall. I am really impressed with the RDNA 2 performance, it makes me happy that AMD has finally raised a competition on GPU side. But the pricing on lower tier such as the 6800 wasn't as good as i expected.

I've been curious for a very long time as to when AMD, as the only CPU & GPU manufacturer will engineer real symbiosis between the two. If it delivers as advertised it won't be a game-changer yet, but will cut in to that advantage. The second, software is something I think they've probably figured out since the 5700's release.

"I feel kind of bad for benchmarkers/reviewers. They're gonna have to test on 3 different platforms AMD 3000, AMD 5000,  and Intel. Not all of us are gonna be able to utilize the Smart Access Memory. Cool feature, but it is gonna make it more complicated.

&#x200B;

The 6800 pricing is odd. For only about 12% more you can get the XT. I wonder if they couldn't make it cheaper because the margins are gonna be razor thin for those or if they're going with their CPU stratagem of pointing out they are the market leader for that segment.

&#x200B;

I would have liked to see Ray-Tracing numbers. Its gonna be disappointing if it doesn't hold up in that category. Then again I've lived this long without RT in my life, I could probably go another year.

&#x200B;

The 16GB of memory might be awesome. It'll be interesting to see memory utilization in games for this. If it's only needing half of the 16GB these things will be great for the future especially with modding.  On the other hand, if it needs all 16GB to get the current performance, that'll be a little unfortunate.

&#x200B;

I wonder how much the AIB 6800XTs are gonna cost. If they actually go for close to MSRP that'll be awesome, but I half expect them to go for closer to $700-$725 kind of taking away the nice price  cut that it has over the 3080.

CUSTOM DESIGNS ARE COMING TOMOROWWWW.. WOHOOOOO",rx_6000_rdna2
"Great presentation, really looking forward to snagging a 6800 XT, if I can get one before the scalpers do.

On that same note, I would have _LOVED_ to see AMD take pre-orders for these cards. It would basically guarantee my pre-order the day they opened. Just imagine if Lisa Su ended the presentation with ""pre-orders start now"", fade to black, holy fuck, I would have been racing to my computer.",rx_6000_rdna2
6800XT looks like a good choice if 3080s aren't available or you want more ram.  6800 seems to be hoping people will make a choice over the 3070 based on ram futureproofing.,rx_6000_rdna2

"16gb is compelling. I feel like the 3080 falls short in terms of a VRAM upgrade from a 1080, but the 3090 is overkill and too expensive. Hmmmmmmmmm. Haven‚Äôt had an AMD gpu since the HD 5770 was new, wonder if that‚Äôll change. Looking forward to some benchmarks!

* for context VRAM is my biggest concern right now since I mostly just play modded cities skylines and my 8gb is always fully saturated in game. Fucking unity.",rx_6000_rdna2
Glad to see some competition. The lack of ray tracing talk is concerning though.,rx_6000_rdna2
"to me it seems like neither won across the board. AMD is easily winning in the high end with 6900xt having comparable performance at 2/3 the cost, while the 3080 and 3070 have comparable performance to the 6800xt and 6800 respectively but roughly 15% cheaper. also keep in mind that amd will likely have slightly better performance at higher resolutions with the increase in VRAM. seems from here that for 80% of people team green is better price to performance which is what most people realistically care about. if you are one of the few who is willing to spend over 1k on a gpu then amd is the way to go. also freesync monitors are usually cheaper and more common so that is one more factor, while ive seen some leaked benchmarks suggesting ray tracing is better on nvidia. hopefully amd drops prices on the 6800xt and 6800 soon, although realistically their prices right now are still probably the same as nvidia once you take the lack of stock into account. either way it will be a close call

EDIT: corrections. as people mentioned pairing with the new amd cpus gives roughly 15% boost according to LTT, and the 6800xt is actually cheaper than the 3080, not more expensive like i previously thought. nice job for amd, but that also means its unlikely we'll see a price reduction and they really havent hit the lower end gpu segment yet",rx_6000_rdna2

"Once the independent benchmarks start rolling in, we'll have a much clearer idea of what the value propositions are going to be like. Initial impressions are that:

6900XT is ludicrous and just absolutely demolished the 3090. Yes, the figures we saw were with a 5000 CPU and Rage mode enabled (OC'd) versus the 3090. But, and this is important, even if it's not quite trading blows with the 3090 in other less ideal setups, it's $500 cheaper. That's absurdly good value. 

Same story for the 6800XT versus the 3080. It will likely fall short of the 3080 with Ray tracing and DLSS is big for team green. But it's slightly smaller, slightly lower TDP, 16gb GDDR6, and cheaper. 

The 6800 seems like AMD just straight skipped out on targeting the 3070 competitor though. Even with only 8gb VRAm on the 3070, it's still a very competitive option with Ray tracing and DLSS likely enabling it to come out ahead.

"Damn, AMD coming out swinging. My thoughts:

For the 6900XT - assuming it delivers what it promises, all they gotta do is have availability (and fix driver issues quickly, if any), then they got this tier in the bag (at least till nvidia responds with the eventual 3090 super duper Ti beefcake edition). They certainly nailed the price. We'll see come benchmark time.

For the 6800XT - I don't really know - this may just come down to supply. People may want the 3080 but they won't wait forever. $50 less MSRP than the 3080 is nice, just gotta see if it really delivers what it promises.

For the 6800 - too expensive imo. They at least should have matched nvidia's price here. At most, maybe $10-20 more - not $80. I feel they're shooting themselves in the foot on this tier with that price. I have a feeling this is an attempt to snag crypto miners on one product because for gaming you're far better off either going for the 3070 if it's available or the 6800XT.",rx_6000_rdna2

Performance from the slides looks nice. I don't care much about ray tracing and they didn't mention whether they used their new tech when making those slides. But that did got me wondering, if amd can pull extra performance because they make the core components (cpu and gpu) would intel and nvidia need to merge - of course this won't happen for at least 10 years (especially if intel manages to make it's own gpu), but if amd can continue with this kind of tempo on both fronts they'll have no competition.

"So, here's my conundrum.

I literally put together my PC last Friday and had purchased a Ryzen 7 3700x but hadn't purchased my GPU yet (I was waiting for a new Nvidia card, but the 6000 series looks incredible and am leaning towards the RX 6800 XT).

My question is this...does the increase with Smart Access Memory and a 5000 series CPU and 6000 series GPU make it worth it to swap the 3700x for the newer Ryzen 7 5800x? Based on what's been released so far, it doesn't seem like the performance increase was that much.

I'm really puzzled by the crazy excitement over their top end card detrhoning Nvidia's though - a moral victory for sure and great news but clearly, 3090 was never meant to be a mass market popular card nor would a 1000$ GPU regardless of it being cheaper by a margin. I might be in a minority but I was very much looking forward to a great competitor on a 3070-ti level. While de 6800XT appears to be a good competitor for the 3080 at 50$ less MSRP and as such, covering the unkowns (drivers, RT, DLSS) a bit, the 6800 at 580$ is a no-go. Sure, it looks better than the 3070 (possibly closer to the hypothetical 3070TI) but the price isn't exactly mid range.. and they know it - instead of pitting it against the 3070 price wise, they compared it to last years 2080TI's price... a bit convenient. At 500$ the 6800 would have been an absolute killer deal. At 530$ probably a good one vs the upcoming 3070TI which I guess will be priced around 550$.

The 6800's price point is a disappointment. RTX 3070 is a better overall deal.

6800 XT seems nice. Not thrilling but nice. It'll sell pretty well, especially with the crappy availability of the RTX 30-series.

I also don't know how infinity cache will age once we see Directstorage and RTX IO supported games hit. The GDDR6X memory in the RTX 3080 and 3090 might end up giving those cards a better boost in newer games.

>AMD tells me it has a new super sampling feature in testing, which is designed to increase performance during ray tracing.

I have an existing 600 Watt power supply in my build that im looking to buy the 6800 non-xt for. However, the presentation today said 650W starting PSUs.

Until the benchmarks come out to validate AMDs claims, the best overall card is still easily the 3080.

I'm hoping their claims can be backed up. Would be an exciting time for PC gaming if that 6800xt can keep pace and if the 6900xt can do what they claim.

"I think AMD most kicked it out of the park.

**PS5/Xbox**

One thing that I think will give AMD a huge leg up this generation is both the Play Station 5 and Xbox both have AMD CPUs & GPUs meaning game developers will be use to working on RDNA2

**Pricing**

6900XT: Right on the money IMHO looks to be a 3090 competitor at $999. Although if they really wanted to kill it I think maybe a bigger infinity cache with more ram...maybe 20 or 24 GB? I think having all GpUs at 16 GB is a mistake.

6800XT: I wish it was lower...but it appears to be faster then a 3080 for $50 less so that's a win

6800: I think this is the biggest mistake in terms of pricing. It shouldn't have been anymore then $550 if I was in charge I'd have set it at $539.99 or $529.99 that way someone looking at a 3070 will be like ""3070 for $499...or $20-$30 more for a card that's 15-20% faster* also by having being a little bit less it would set a bigger price difference between its bigger brother

**AMD CPU CONNECTION**
Yesterday I was actually thinking ""It would be cool if AMD said ""Buy both CPU/GPU together and get a $25-$50 discount on the package""

But I think by having AMD CPUs have an exlusive feature with their AMD GPU is great!

Imo GPUs need to be able to pull off at LEAST 60fps+ at the target resolution (generally 1440p or 4k with the current lineup of mid to high end cards) with ray tracing turned on, if they want to provide a true next gen experience.

I see a lot of people downplay ray tracing and my question to them is, have you even tried it?

Ray tracing is what makes next gen feel and look like next gen.

Obviously it makes a massive difference in a game like Control, but even where it's not a big presence like in warzone or metro exodus, it's the little things like the lighting through the fog at night, or the reflections in floorboards as you move across them, the atmosphere of which can't really be captured fully in a screenshot or even a youtube vid, that totally change the way the game feels. Even its showcase in games like Quake II and Minecraft show how dramatically ray tracing can change the feeling and atmosphere of a game. You really have to have your hands on the keyboard and mouse while you move through these ray traced worlds to understand how awesome it is. Ray tracing has been the biggest breath of dynamics and realism into gaming since...I don't even know and I have been gaming for over 25 years.

However an unreasonable sacrifice in performance  for ray tracing is not worth it - we saw this with the 2000 series. Turning ray tracing on was just not worth the performance hit unless you have a 2080ti and even there it's not always great. It's gotta be smooth and buttery for it to work.

For the sake of gamers and for the sake of healthy competition between NVIDIA and AMD, I hope AMD has pulled this off.

Nonetheless they have killed the 3090 imo (as a gaming card), but that was always a bad purchase relative to the 3080.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Props to AMD for not falling for the 8k gaming meme fiasco when presenting the 6900XT, advertising it as a 4k gaming card instead of falsely promising 8k gaming performance like Nvidia did with the 3090, even though we would need a card twice as fast as the 3090 for 8k to become viable.",rx_6000_rdna2

There wasn't much discussed about ray tracing performance, despite the showcase of games partway through.

I'd wager that the hardware isn't that optimized for it, and that the benchmarks leaked as of late are accurate in Radeon's falling behind with RT.

On the other hand, the RX 6800 seems like it is priced a tad too high for my liking for it to make a meaningful impact. Sure, it outperforms the RTX 3070 and RTX 2080 Ti by a claimed 10-20 performance lead and it has a juicy 16GB, but it costs more. In terms of optics, hitting that $499 price point I think would have done more for AMD here to make inroads since $499 is the stretching point for many people's budgets, especially with the current world situation. If an RTX 3070 Ti comes in at $599, yeah, I will feel the RX 6800 succeeded in the end. As it is, though, I feel like the crown jewel of the line up is the RX 6800 XT.

The 3090 and the 6900 xt are confusing products all around for gaming. Extremely impressive that AMD was able to build a very similar card for that price though.

I still think that the 3800 is superior to the 6800 xt. I feel like if someone is going to fork out $650+ for a new card, they'd be willing to shell out another $50-$75 to get the better product.  

Raytracing and DLSS are no joke and are significant gaps IMO. Excited to see how AMD responds in the future to these techs.

3070 still seems like the best bang for your buck at that tier of card. Surprised at the price point for the 6800. Real performance tests and non-cherry picked benchmarks can swing the dial on this point.

I feel like AMD is going to win a lot of people over if their supply comes near the demand for their new products. Nvidia really fumbled the ball in that respect. Just really happy all around that there is some legit competition in this space. Thank you AMD, you're going to make everyone better because of this... Looking at you Intel.",rx_6000_rdna2

Yes, the 6800 has more VRAM which is already part of the current performance equation, will it be better in the future? Possibly.

The 3080 in the 6800XT comparison slide had quite lower FPS than actual performance numbers. Same with the 3090 with the 6900XT. The 3090 pulls around 160 - 180 in 4K in Doom Eternal, yet AMD has it near 150. SoTTR likewise lists the 3090 tied at 96 fps in 4K, while it runs between 100 - 110. 

I'd wager the 6900XT will be more in line with the 3080. Also keep in mind these benchmarks are with RAGE and SAM enabled too.

I still think the best value is the 6800, u can probably OC it on water to get within 10-15% of a 3080 minus the RT and DLSS. Still, much better than I expected.

"While I should trust AMD, the way they presented the benchmarks just made me seem suspicious.

One thing they never did was show the actual number for the Ampere cards and only showed their numbers, which makes me suspicious as to how they scaled it. They could have made a 1-2 frame difference seem much bigger. They also never mentioned which card this was and if this was after the issues with AIBs (which they could have totally attacked). Not only that, but they just sneak in the fact that they were using overclocking (in the 6900XT vs 3090) and their new smart storage technology.  It just seems like their numbers for Ampere and their own numbers were messed with a little and presented so that their gain over Ampere was much smaller than what was shown. I may be wrong, but this is what we attacked NVIDIA for in their presentation.

Not only that, but they completely skipped over raytracing without any performance numbers which makes me think that their raytracing is absolute garbage.

I just really think that their testing methods and presentation could have easily changed the actual performance numbers you would get in a more realistic scenario.",rx_6000_rdna2

Obligatory.. .. But will the drivers be garbage?,rx_6000_rdna2
"So... let me get this straight, RX6800 has pretty much the same rasterization performance as an RTX 3080 at the same price, but worse ray tracing performance (no details provided so safe assumption) and no DLSS equivalent.  Same deal for the RX6900 -> RTX 3090..   but.. $400 less... Which will be negated by the rumoured 3080ti...   I don't really see this as a win for AMD imo",rx_6000_rdna2
"To really win this, all AMD had to do was to handily beat the 3000 series in price / perf.  They did this with the 6900, but how many people are going to throw 1k at a GPU?  They *really* needed to hit hard with the 6800/XT, but I'm just not seeing it.  The only way AMD succeeds here is to have plentiful stock day 1 of launch, which, I can't see them doing as badly as Nvidia but still, it's gona be hard.  I'm kinda luke warm on this release.  They should have done better with pricing.",rx_6000_rdna2
[deleted],rx_6000_rdna2
"Expensive imo. The RX 6800 for 80bucks more than a RTX 3070? No way, c'mon AMD.

For now, RTX 3070 is what looks like the best spot for new GPUs... but the third party comparative benchmarks will say. Let's see what brings to the arena the future RTX 3060/RX 6700, too.",rx_6000_rdna2
Drop all cards down 100$ and you'll win the market.,rx_6000_rdna2
"6800XT is the only one that somewhat makes sense compared to 3080 (altough still  -with Ryzen 5000 and 500 series chipset). 

6900XT doesn't really compete with 3090 because RTX is a semi pro card with more RAM and CUDA optimisation and AMD won't touch it, it doesn't compete with 3080 either because it's $300 more. It's a show-off card.

Regular 6800 is too expensive. It's 5-10% faster than RTX3070 but costs 15% more. It offers worse price to performance ratio, nVidia is a better buy.",rx_6000_rdna2
"So... what do you guys think about the announced perf and prices of the RDNA2 6000 series?

Looks like Turding prices confirmed to me, more or less.

* xx70 class @ 579$ ( 80$ higher )
* xx80 class @ 650$ ( 49$ lower )
* xx80ti class @ 999$ ( same as Turding 2080Ti )

So much for competition on pricing...

If there's no competition on pricing, competition doesn't help consumers.

And I expect this utterly stupid xx70 class pricing is to jack up the price on their eventual xx60 class offering.

To think you could buy a xx60 class for 250-300$ not so long ago. Now... I expect 450-500$

Pure utter stupidity. Makes perfect sense for AMD's bottom line and the shareholders pockets tho. But for consumers? Lol, GET REKTED.

If AMD has a DLSS 2.0 competitor which is just as good or better, and the performance is as good as they have shown, this card is looking like the clear winner unless a 3080 Super comes out very soon, which seems unlikely.",rx_6000_rdna2

Investing in AMD: What to consider
Despite existing for nearly 50 years, semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Dynamics (AMD) is not a market leader in its two main manufacturing categories: CPUs and GPUs. The general notion towards the company is that is offers products with slightly lower performance at significantly lower prices. After struggling for several years, AMD stock price quadrupled in 2016.


On the GPU front, AMD‚Äôs main rival is NVIDIA, which is considered the market leader. However, while NVIDIA has a firm grasp on the high-end market, AMD presents significant competition due to its superior performance-to-price ratio, which is alluring to those who wish to build high-performance gaming PCs on a budget.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Everyone complaining about the rt speed compared to Nvidia, these cards have a lot of turbo clocking headroom and let's not forget they are cheaper by a good margin. Also driver improvements are likely coming.

You're getting a cheaper card that almost runs as good as waaaay more expensive ones.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Performance overall is higher than I was expecting which is good, but I dont think the lower prices versus the Nvidia counterparts are worth the loss of RTX and DLSS (plus other) features. I genuinely see RTX and DLSS becoming widespread over the next 4 years, so if you're somebody who likes to keep their GPU for a good while I think its generally worth paying the small premium for Nvidia for those features personally",rx_6000_rdna2

There is just no way I could justify spending $550 bucks on a GPU alone!! That is just insane, and it shows just how ridiculous prices in this industry are getting in the last couple years. 

It's to the point where I'm not even considering upgrading my PC anymore and just saying fuck it and going with a Playstation or something.

It not that I don't have the money, it's that I just can't justify paying the insanely inflated prices these companies are pushing on consumers now, just for something to play games on and do a little rendering and video editing.

I remember when $200-250 was the sweet spot for a nice mid-range GPU. Now the entry point is over $550. Fucking ridiculous.

"I personally thought there might be a bit of a catch to the performance graphs shown, and I think I know what it was.

IIRC, the graphs shown comparing the 
RX 6000 series cards with the Nvidia cards showed the difference in performance with SAM and/or Rage Mode turned on, and the graphs don't take into account that not everyone will be able to use SAM if they have older CPU's to pair. Their graphs might also disregard the software features that boost performance on the Nvidia cards, which means in titles where the AMD card outperforms, the performance difference will realistically be smaller, such as between the 6800XT and RTX 3080, for example.

Unpopular opinion but I think both prices are $30 too dear... i.e.

6800 XT should be $619

6800 should be $549

I'm sure they don't want to increase the gap between the two cards because I think they want buyers to look and go for the 6800XT because it's not that much more expensive. But for me who games at 1440p, I will be bargain hunting for a 6800 come summer and if it fell under the sub $500 mark by then it would sell like hotcakes.

"AMD has proven that they can beat Nvidia on price to performance ratios pretty easily, no doubt about it.  Where they fall down is reliability.

Look up ""<any AMD GPU> crash"" and you'll find the same thing over and over:  people experiencing the exact same thing, CTDs, hard crashes, green screens, etc.  Everybody goes through the exact same troubleshooting and MAYBE manages to find the driver version that doesn't crash constantly.  That has been the story over and over and over with every generation of AMD GPUs.

I had an RX 5700 xt, price to performance it was outstanding, no question, but after WEEKS of trying to get it to work reliably I finally got utterly sick of it and got a 2070 Super.  Yeah, I had to pay a couple hundred more for the Nvidia card, but you know what that couple hundred got me?  Flawless reliability. Over the last 16 years with around 10 Nvidia GPUs I *never* had issues like I had with AMD.

Buying an AMD GPU is a gamble because all too often their drivers suck.  At the end of the day what does it matter if their price to performance ratio is great or their specs are better than Nvidia's when you can't play half your games?

And not to be rude, but please spare me the ""*MY* 5700 xt works great!"" comments.  Trust me, I know.  Some of you are the lucky ones that get the perfect confluence of events and win the AMD GPU lottery.  Far too many people aren't that lucky.  Just because *you* didn't fall victim to AMD's problems don't mean they don't exist.  If you didn't have to go through all this troubleshooting and frustration you're lucky, but you're also unaware of just how ubiquitous it's been.

Also, RTX on or off in those benchmarks? That will affect numbers too, and I think they should have made that clear in the slides at the end with the specs and settings.

Edit: Lots of people seem to be pissed about my DLSS comments, and about ""turning off the gimmicks."" Realistically, nobody is going to be running a GPU with the gimmicks off, unless they get absolutely garbage performance, like in the early RTX 2000 days. In addition to stuff like hardware ray tracing and DLSS, AMD doesn't have the ""gamer"" and streaming features that Nvidia has, with stuff like Geforce Experience, Shadowplay, NVENC, and CUDA-based compute for professional applications (Blender, Premiere, DaVinci Resolve). I still want to see AMD's ray tracing experience, performance with DLSS on, raw compute performance for workstation stuff, and thermals before I make any kind of decision.

That sounds good but really I see no reason to buy the 6900XT. For gaming the 6900XT and the RTX3090 are price performance wise just not very good. They are too expensive for the performance gain they offer over the 6800XT and 3080. The RTX3090 at least seems to have a niche in the field of machine learning and probably other work related use cases.

"Just in case no one did the math, because I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else post the number yet. 

Adding on the rage mode and SAM percentages for the 6800 XT and comparing it to the 6900 XT numbers given with those turned on, the 6900 XT is 6-10% faster in the titles shown. 

That‚Äôs a decent difference, but obviously not 35% better and there is litterally no other difference other than CUs, so there really doesn‚Äôt seem like there is as much of an advantage. At least there is some reason people would go for the 3090 in high memory use applications. They probably should have tweaked just a little more on the 6900 XT. If everything else is even on the two cards, something tells me they are running this card at the limit, so we will see what OC overhead there might or might not be.

But I am pretty set on the 6800 XT as my next card, given availability. Wish the AIB cards were available though. Would have loved like a TUF gaming based card. Or one of sapphires pulse cards. Dot know how long that‚Äôs going to take, though I may have to wait that long anyway.",rx_6000_rdna2
">6900 XT is 3090 performance

I will wait for reviews to check that because in the graphs they showed comparing the 6900 XT it was using ""Rage mode"" which is OC and it isn't fair when the card you are comparing to doesn't also have OC applied.

Still it is cheaper so in the end it will probably have a better performance/price ratio.",rx_6000_rdna2
"My concern is that it was clearly leaning towards slightly less performance than the 3090 with 16GB of VRAM and no RTX benchmarks.

It still seems like a far better choice but it's not as clear cut as you make it out to be.

"More likely nvidia will release 3080ti with 3090 die, 12gb vram and 3090 level gaming performance. 3090 still got more vram than 6900 so it's actually worth it for professionals (3d rendering/machine learning forks).",rx_6000_rdna2

"Uses G6 instead of G6X memory but also has 8GB less of it as well. Not saying the 3090 is a great deal but will still be the top for content creators I feel. 

On top of the RT and DLSS concerns (which are pretty big tbh), I‚Äôd like to see drivers not being a catastrophe for months post launch. I was going to go with a 3080 but stock has been nonexistent but now that I see AMD has actual competition (at least in the FPS department), I‚Äôm gonna hold off till the benchmarks are out for the 6000 series cards before I make any purchase. Looking like I may potentially run a full AMD set up now and get a little bonus in performance from SAM. Currently on a 8600K 1080Ti, I‚Äôm thinking a 5900X and potentially a 6900XT would be a killer set up!",rx_6000_rdna2
"3090 is still a better value than 6900xt for the people who want those features. 3090 is only incidentally a gaming card. It's really for productivity workloads that can make use of 24GB DDR6X. 6900xt doesn't have the memory bandwidth or capacity to run those workloads. Oh, and no CUDA is a pretty big deal.

6900xt is more like a 3080 ti than a 3090. Expect a 3080 ti to come out shortly after the 6900xt, probably at the same $999 price point.",rx_6000_rdna2
"3090 was never really intended for gaming tho, people who need it for AI will still eat it up, esp because of that 24gb vram",rx_6000_rdna2

Good point.,rx_6000_rdna2
"I think so too. But the impact of that will only be visible in a year or so when the larger triple a titles on console will have been released and had some updates.
It‚Äôs not something that we‚Äôll see clearly in the benchmarks now I think.",rx_6000_rdna2
That‚Äôs something that has been blowing my mind about people saying nvidia‚Äôs rtx tech is better- like they can make that claim if they want but AMD‚Äôs RT tech is what is going to be utilised and optimised for in consoles and games ported either way which is a HUGE advantage,rx_6000_rdna2
What does that mean? What benefits can we expect from that?,rx_6000_rdna2
"With that pricing, I don't think they actually want to sell that many 6800 non-xt:s.

"> might as well 70$ more for huge performance boost and get the xt. 

It's the same with the 5800X and 5900X. The 5800X only exist to make the price of the 5900X look better.

The want to harvest people that have the money first and later introduce more reasonable priced version in that performance bracket.",rx_6000_rdna2

Nah 6800> 3070,rx_6000_rdna2
Well they want you to choose the higher options,rx_6000_rdna2
nonsense for the 6800 non-xt,rx_6000_rdna2
It's depends on if the 3070 is actually available for $500 or if the real price for most consumers will be closer to $550.,rx_6000_rdna2
Yeah it's good. If my 3080 order won't go through I might look at this one.,rx_6000_rdna2
6800 has double the vram of 3070 so it cant really be cheaper can it.,rx_6000_rdna2

7. drivers. Not only are Nvidia‚Äôs driver regarded to crash less frequently, but also Nvidia supports gpus much longer with driver updates.

Kind of? There‚Äôs still a lot of conflicting reports about 5700XTs crashing with black screen, but FWIW I have a 5700XT and haven‚Äôt had any crashing issues.

"We didn't really get technical details on how this is possible, but the fact that AMD develops and manufactures both CPUs and GPUs allows them to bake in this sort of functionality. Nvidia doesn't manufacture CPUs, and Intel doesn't manufacture GPUs, so they would require some sort of partnership in order to develop technologies that work hand in hand.

Found this comment by /u/doommaster:  
"" they are basically expanding heterogenous memory access, where the CPU can read/write from VRAM and the GPU can read/write from CPU-RAM...

"I suspect that you are right but at the moment AMD doesn't have a NAVI 22-based GPU ready (which is what the 6700 and 6700XT would be built on). 

The 6800 is a cut down 6800XT which is itself just a cut down 6900XT so they've done what  they can to respond to each of Nvidia's announced offerings with the only chip they have ready today. 

Nvidia has a bit of advantage (at least on paper) by having both GA102 (3080 and 3090) and a separate smaller GA104 (3070) which can be sold more cheaply. 

The 6700 products should be able to offer more competitive pricing but I'll bet the 6800 will overclock very nicely as it looks like they've limited clocks in addition to disabling CUs in order to hit the lower performance and power targets.  I think it will be very hard for Nvidia to touch 6800 level performance with a GA104-based card (e.g. 3070 TI) assuming that 6800 will have at least 200mhz in OC headroom to match it's siblings and perhaps even more with a higher power budget.",rx_6000_rdna2

So no, I think you can safely keep your 750w psu and won't run into any problems under normal high load circumstances.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Quite honestly nobody knows except AMD. It's possible AMD are being conservative with their power recommendations or alternatively they could be keeping quiet about it being an watt munching beast. 

Ultimately it depends on the power consumption of your pc as a whole. If you're slapping the 6900 into a rig with a 15W laptop cpu you'll probably be fine. If you've got an old AMD FX9590 overclocked you're gonna have issues. 

The RTX 3090 [uses a bit under 400W according to Guru3D](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/geforce-rtx-3090-founder-review,7.html) if it even uses that much I don't see the 6900 using much more. [As an example, the Ryzen 3900 was measured at a peak of 142W](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14605/the-and-ryzen-3700x-3900x-review-raising-the-bar/19#:~:text=The%203900X%20is%20also%20impressive,consumption%2C%20peaking%20in%20at%20142W.) Add 100W leeway for the rest of the system you're looking at roughly 650W actual power usage. A good quality 750W psu will manage that all day.

A higher power psu may run more efficiently, efficiency curves tend to look like a gentle hill with the peak around 60% of their max power. You would also be putting less load on the components of the psu so may get a longer lifespan from your psu. 

However I don't personally think it's a huge issue, you will probably get away with 750W.",rx_6000_rdna2
"You will be fine with a 750w, just make sure its a good PSU from seasonic\\corsair",rx_6000_rdna2

Without a nvidia card you are not only loosing gsync but depending on your monitor you are only going to be able to run it at a maximum of 100hz or 85hz.

You may disable gsync in the nvidia control panel and set the refresh rate to 85 hz to check if you are fine with it. But I personally would either try to sell my old display and get a new used one with freesync for the same money or pay 50$ more to get a 3080.",rx_6000_rdna2

"At  Hardware Unboxes, at 1440p the average across 14 games...the 3070 was exactly the same as a 2080Ti, while the 10 game averages AMD shared it looks to be somewhere around 15% faster and those games are mostly in HU's 14 game  suite as well.  Obviously all of us  need to wait for real reviews, but for sure the existence of a 3070Ti is more than likely that the 6800 handily beats the 3070 overall.

For the few articles I could find that *did* mention it:

>The other question is whether AMD will have an alternative to DLSS. The  answer: It's working on what it calls Super Resolution, **but it's not yet  ready**. Super Resolution will be part of the hardware-agnostic  FidelityFX suite, just like the current CAS (Contrast Aware Sharpening).  We've seen quite a few games use FidelityFX with CAS, and uptake is  basically at about the same rate as games using ray tracing and/or DLSS.

"We knew that they would have some form of ray tracing, nobody is saying that it doesnt support RT at all, but the fact that they showed literally 0 comparisons for ray tracing, which is one of the most hyped features of this generation kind of hints that the ray tracing performance wouldnt stack up well versus their Nvidia counterparts.

"This is really tough to say. 

Right off the bat, I would say yes, without a doubt they will sell out right away. 

But TSMC is manufacturing the gpu which they've been doing for years, and have a well fleshed system. 

While Nvidia just switched over to Samsung (from TSMC) for the ampere cards. 

Now this is just speculation, and I have no evidence to back any of this up, so feel free to disagree, but I feel like the switch to Samsung is a large part of the stock issues. 

Not so much because I think Samsung is a bad company, or can't handle the demand, but I just think switching over manufacturing companies like that will always raise issues and problems. I'm sure with time Nvidia and Samsung will have a good partnership and everything will be fine. 

But I definitley think that and sticking with TSMC, and also sticking with the 7nm process, could certainly mean that they have a decent head start with things, and that and will be able to bounce back from a supply shortage much quicker. 

Also, amd will likely not see as high of a demand, since Nvidia has a very large market share on the PC side of things, it's no secret that Nvidia is a ""color brand"" where people buy them because if the name, and not so much for the performance, or the price to performance. Essentially, they see a green card and they buy it. 

And one final thing to consider. AMD has been manufacturing rDNA 2 chips for the upcoming consoles for a while now, which could be a benefit in that they have a good grasp on the architecture and the manufacturing is operating quickly and efficiently, or it could mean that they have been taking up manufacturing space from the PC market to meet demand for the consoles.

But it‚Äôs weird because the 6900XT seems ridiculous good value compared to the RTX 3090. AMD really messed up with the pricing. But I suspect they want to reserve the 399-499 space for the RX 6700XT.",rx_6000_rdna2

If you have a good quality PSU (think reputable brand 80+ Gold and up) 600W should be fine at stock speeds. Keep in mind it depends on your CPU too.

I got dips and needed to lower settings to about Medium or High in other titles like Half Life Alyx, or ReVive Games like Lone Echo or Stormland to stay locked at 90Hz. But that could probably be fixed if I didn't have the Supersampling set so high.

"How so? The 3090 was basically the same thing as the 3080, but nearly double the price and only a few percent higher performance. The 6900XT is a much better deal by comparison for gaming.

I think the 3080 is the real sweet spot here. Nearly 6800XT/3080 performance for <$600 and way better than the 3070 is awesome. It'll be interesting to see how OC is on the 6800, hopefully we'll get another 1700 vs 1800x situation.",rx_6000_rdna2
It's the sku that makes the 6800xt look like a deal and acts as a halo product competing at the top.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Still overpriced for what it offers but at least it's much better when you think of the 3090's price. Problem is Nvidia has long since opened the door for the sky high prices.

Stick with the 5700. It's about as powerful as the next gen consoles. Next gen AMD will have a better ray tracing solution and the performance jump will be bigger. I bought my card in January and I've liked it a lot. It runs rainbow six and other esports titles in 4k already.,rx_6000_rdna2

"Instead, amd is using a new technology they developed called infinity cache, which allows for similar bandwidth as gddr6x while using regular gddr6",rx_6000_rdna2
The 128MB of infinity cache compensates for the speed difference between GDDR6 and 6X. Speed will be the least of your worries if you fill your frame buffer however so the amount of RAM available for higher resolutions is a far bigger potential concern for future game titles.,rx_6000_rdna2

Except with missing the DLSS and with a completely unknown RT performance.",rx_6000_rdna2
But do you want DLSS/RTX/Nvidia software?,rx_6000_rdna2

yeah.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Not really.

"" FASTER than 2080Ti"" Is marketing talk, we would need real-life benchmarks.

That amount VRAM will hardly be a decider for the average consumer.

There is lack of comparable ray tracing performance along with DLSS type technology which makes ray tracing viable to begin with.

Nvidia driver support is far better atm too.

There are overall fewer features.

Nvidia's mindshare and game developer support is tremendously greater than AMD's so having a competing card that costs more than the Nvidia option is in fact silly imo. If anything is DOA it would be the 6800.",rx_6000_rdna2
Anyone who needs that much will clearly be getting a ~~Quadro~~ RTX A.,rx_6000_rdna2

I mean sure it has -2%-10% according to slides. Lets say 5% performance when benches come.

I have the money where I am willing to pay more without being concerned when a game with Raytracing/heavy features comes and I could get roughly 70% more performance when it matters. 5% even if true is not much to me on an average game when I dont need it.",rx_6000_rdna2
"For someone who is just gaming, they don't care about 24Gb. 16Gb won't be a limitation over the lifetime of gaming with either GPU. The niche users that need 24Gb will get the 3090.. it's not a major contention point.",rx_6000_rdna2
"I remember how people speculated that AMD would barely be able to compete with the 2080 Ti, it's funny because all AMD previous recent generations were absurdly overhyped and ended up being a massive disappointment, while this time it was the other way around, the expectations were extremely low and yet AMD managed to deliver what according to their benchmarks appears to be their best generation in way too many years and their first absolute win over Nvidia since forever, beating Nvidia at everything and having a direct competitor at even the highest end.",rx_6000_rdna2

Also it is yet unclear when they will release their DLSS competitor Super resolution and it is unclear if the image quality will be as good as DLSS 2 or even better. If it is going to be as bad as DLSS 1.0 it would be totally useless.

So you should probably wait for benchmarks from third parties and until their release of their DLSS competitor, if you are able to wait till probably next year or whenever they release their competitor/you are actually able to buy a card.

Do you expect a BMW with less features to be priced the same as a high performance Toyota? No. The honest truth is that companies won't bat an eye at feedback such as lowering the price because they have a target market they know are willing to pay the cost.

the 6800xt competes with the 3080 and undercuts by  50 dollars. Pretty good value

the 6800 cannot in any way compete with a 500 dolar 3070 with a price of  580 dollars. But at the same time it should not be able to compete with the 3080 in performance. sooooo whats that card for?

If you're rocking 1080p, not sure you'd get much benefit from upgrading 2060 should be plenty, though I guess you could benefit with 8gb vram, but 1080p is super low requirement on vram compared to 1440p or 4K",rx_6000_rdna2

"Very doubtful. Very good titanium 700w or good 800 gold.. if the 6800 non xt peaks at 300 for whatever reason. Plus 150 over estimate for CPU and ram that's already 450. Plus mobo and other shit U are dipping into serious power drop territory.

That isn't even including amp draw from the 12v rail. 
If it's too high(and the 6800 will most likely peak at 40-60amps if it's anything like a 5600xt(it'll be more)) it'll trip the over current protection and ur PC will just shit down. 

That isn't to say it's not possible. you might get away with it. I mean you can just try. The worst that will happen is the PC will shutdown when the PSU can't deliver power to the GPU.

"At a guess, that would be to keep costs down. They seem to be targeting a specific value and going with larger quantities either means more complexity on the PCB (384 bit bus for example), or obscene costs for VRAM to increase die size.

"Yep I‚Äôm very happy with my decision to go console instead of upgrading. Amd cpus are more expensive this gen, and gpus on both side are super expensive (especially in Canada). Hopefully things get better in a couple years. Worst case I hope the used market has better deals by then because this is horrible.",rx_6000_rdna2
It's supposed to compete with the RTX 3080 ($699),rx_6000_rdna2
Looks a little bit faster than the 3070 for a little bit more money.,rx_6000_rdna2

24gb GDDR6X vs 16gb GDDR6,rx_6000_rdna2
Facts,rx_6000_rdna2
"to be fair, the 6800 was compared to a 2080ti. WHY? because all the independent reviews for the 3070 show the 3070 is actually SLOWER than the 2080ti in most titles.... the FACT that the 6800 is bitch slapping the 2080ti, means its bitch slapping the 3070..... which no one will realize until after the independent reviews for the 6800 hit",rx_6000_rdna2
"As they haven't mentioned raytracing performance at all and they have no competition to DLSS...

I would say, AMD will lose quite badly. The rumours of raytracing performance being 2080 Ti levels for the 6800 XT are probably true.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Good question, but I assume that after aome time the AMD cards will catch-up, since new consoles use the same architecture and will also use ray-tracing and other tricks to have playable framerates! So I wouldn‚Äôt worry to much!",rx_6000_rdna2
"consoles are on the same RDNA2 architecture as this so I can't imagine there isn't going to be a huge discrepancy in the RT experience.

None of the consoles are going to utilize DLSS so in many cases, multiplatform titles will be using an rdna2 type of RT unless the developer goes out of their way to support it.",rx_6000_rdna2
The RT on the AMD gpus should be about the same as the RT offered on consoles. It's the same architecture. Give it a bit. Nice thing about sharing architecture with consoles is the tricks console devs will be figuring out to optimize RT on consoles should translate to the dGPUs.,rx_6000_rdna2
25 min and we all know that it will not be as good as ampere but slightly better than turing.. as for RT tbh dude we will need to wait for MCM rdna 2 and nvidia hopper,rx_6000_rdna2

"Xbox Series X destroys anything in terms of value, it's a godsend to gaming, offering 4K/60FPS gaming for 499$, combine that with Gamepass and it's golden!",rx_6000_rdna2
There's no way PC gaming will ever come close to newly launched consoles in price/perf. Sony and MS are willing to take losses over the hardware so they can encourage game sales.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Well, better take console out of the price equation. Console always sell at a loss or breakeven. You should compare it with 3070. 15% more perf compare to 2080Ti and 3070, it's reasonable to ask a bit more.",rx_6000_rdna2
"WTF are you smoking bro? WTF compares GPU specs with consoles?

BTW, by your definition RTX 3070 doesn't look good either. Since it's basically similar value to the RX 6800.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Agreed, i'd have liked to see the 6800 a bit lower in price as it's currently too close to the 6800XT - I couldn't justify not spending the extra $70 and getting 20% more CU's and higher clocks",rx_6000_rdna2
"My worry is that the software is Mediocre as has been the case on AMD gpu's for a while. For me personally, that 50 dollar difference isn't that big of a deal when I consider the performance improvement and software implementations of Nvidia technology in applications I use for working and developing. I'd *like* for that to change, but I'm not sure if I'd hold my breath for it.",rx_6000_rdna2
We need to see nvidia's reaction to this first.,rx_6000_rdna2
the 6900xt is actually,rx_6000_rdna2
I don't think the 6800 is supposed to rival the 3070. I think that'll be the 6700/XT,rx_6000_rdna2
"I've been looking at 5700xt around $410. I absolutely would have made the jump to a 6800 at $499. But that is probably why it's launching a bit higher. The 5700xt is still a very good card. 2060 supers are hard to find. So there isn't a lot of competition in that range.

Plus AMD has some wiggle room to cut the price if the 3070 has a stronger launch than the other 2 3000 cards.",rx_6000_rdna2
It has 16gb of vram. I‚Äôm sorry it wasn‚Äôt $70 cheaper. It doesn‚Äôt compete with the 3070. Those cards are coming next year.,rx_6000_rdna2
"6700xt and 6700 coming January, 6500/6600 haven‚Äôt even been leaked",rx_6000_rdna2
They'll probably bring out a 6700xt for around that price point in a few months,rx_6000_rdna2

"3070 also beats 2080ti, for $500.",rx_6000_rdna2
But what about DLSS? It's a big feature of the 30 series cards and in games where it's enabled the AMD cards can't compete,rx_6000_rdna2
"I'm loving the competition. If I didn't get lucky on snagging a 3080, a 6800XT sounds great. Still does since I plan to grab a 5000 CPU so I'll be curious to see how they work together. Regardless this will force nvidia to release the 3080Ti at $1000 I think.",rx_6000_rdna2

Supposed to,rx_6000_rdna2
"i am not an expert, but it sounds like they did some ray tracing stuff with direct x tech, it sounds like a 'weak' way of including it. the rtx 3080 price is still very close to amd, I will have to decide which one to go with depending on benchmarks and reviewers. personally I like the AMD software more, I really like the record desktop and instant replay stuff.",rx_6000_rdna2

"It's not impossible they will announce a 8gb version at some point.

though IMHO it's unlikely. At those performance levels 8gb would be a waste, more likely 8gb will be on on the lower priced ""budget"" cards (assuming they announce those later...)",rx_6000_rdna2
"First half? correct. Second half? Wrong. There is one rt core per ""cu""..reducing their number wouldn't make the gou faster at all, only slower in rt, since they can do it concurrently.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Interesting point. It's a bit of a gamble. Back when Rasterization first started in the early 2000s, nay-sayers scoffed and said ""why the heck would we change how we render? This tech is just a gimmick that won't catch on!""

"I would expect the 40 CU 6700 XT (which should be no more than 10% slower than the 2080 Ti) at about $450, with the 6700 at $400. The 6700XT will surely lie within the $280-$350 range.",rx_6000_rdna2

"If you plan on playing next gen titles at 4k, 8Gb of RAM is starting to become a bottleneck. It's fine for 1080p or 1440p, but I wouldn't buy an 8Gb card for 4k. Other than that, the 6800 looks like it could be a few percent faster on average.",rx_6000_rdna2

I seriously doubt it.

Having been watching the white papers nVidia has been generating from their Research department in the last 5 years, unfortunately AMD has an insurmountable hill to climb.

2-Minute Papers has been covering some of nVidia's tech over the years, https://www.youtube.com/c/K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai/search?query=nvidia

This video is a good example of just what the AI cores in the nVidia cards will be a huge deal,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NUVPwmofU

As much as I applaud AMD this round, and I love to pick up an AMD card to pair with my AMD CPU,

They just won't be able to compete against nVidia's AI tech. It's such a game changer on so many levels.

And not only upscaling, 

but 

- procedural generation

- Noise Cancelling in Audio

- Physics simulation

All of which will use those Tensor Cores to an extreme.",rx_6000_rdna2

I sure hope so. Because the current looks of the prices of the 6800 (which is what i think you are referring to.

The driver situation and mindshare just ain't there yet. But if they...to coin a verb...ryzen it along...they can get there in 3-4 years of intense market disruption.",rx_6000_rdna2
It depends on how well AMD software matches NVIDIA. If dlss 2.0 and RTX is still better (which I suspect it will be by a lot) I think 3070 and 3080 are safe,rx_6000_rdna2
Sorry noob question? Is the direct competitor of the 3070 the 6800 ?,rx_6000_rdna2
"Definitely not RIP 3070, still amazing performance and cheapest new gen card for now.",rx_6000_rdna2
"AMD literally opted out of showing benchmarks with ray tracing, and nvidia has DLSS going in its favor.

I was kind of expecting them to come in more than $50 cheaper than the 3080; esp when not showing RT performance honestly. /shrug",rx_6000_rdna2
"Interesting take considering they showed no Raytracing benchmarks and no DLSS competitor for now. I would pay $50 extra for those 2 features, ez",rx_6000_rdna2
They mentioned super resolution. its still in development,rx_6000_rdna2
"Super Resolution is literally that, they did talk about it... For like half a second.",rx_6000_rdna2
So the fact that 6900xt is 30% cheaper with basically same 4k performance means nothing.,rx_6000_rdna2
but it's $500 cheaper..it is a WIN anyway,rx_6000_rdna2
RX 6800 has double the amount of VRAM.,rx_6000_rdna2
8GB More VRAM so probably more suitable for 4K than the 3070 is.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Yeah, everything else at least made sense to me except for 6800 pricing.",rx_6000_rdna2
Most of the charts showed the Smart Access and Rage Mode so yeah.,rx_6000_rdna2
AMD are probably banking on the 3070 not selling for 500 but at a much more inflated price.,rx_6000_rdna2
Could be in response to an expected shortage of 3070 stock given what we've seen with 3080 and 3090 supply.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Not to mention no DLSS competitor was mentioned, unless I'm blind. RIP AMD's budget market control.",rx_6000_rdna2
"6800 has twice the vram of 3070. Might be banking on the value of that to some people.
Plus I suspect a price drop to come for it after Nvidia releases the 3070TI.",rx_6000_rdna2
what they showed for the 6800 was maybe 10-15% better than the 3070.,rx_6000_rdna2
"AMD said the 6800 is ~18% faster than the 2080ti, so it should be 17-19% faster than the 3070, at 16% higher price and with double the VRAM. Seems pretty fair to me.",rx_6000_rdna2
I think it‚Äôs the RTX 3080 which is similar in performance to the 2080Ti.,rx_6000_rdna2
Right now the 6800 only exist to make the price of the 6800 XT look better. They will introduce cheaper models or drop the 6800 price later.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Not barely beating it, did you even see the same charts? it is the better card by far.",rx_6000_rdna2
ML is still Nvidia's game with most framework using CUDA,rx_6000_rdna2
"A hole CUDA Ecosystem, and they established themselves early",rx_6000_rdna2
Exactly what I'm waiting for. AMD didn't really mentioned or show any specifics about this area. Tis why I wait.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Yeah what about encoding for Streaming on Twitch, Gamer these days want to Stream,",rx_6000_rdna2
649 lol,rx_6000_rdna2
drivers are definitely the massive issue with AMD gpu's in the past. Wonder if they will improve,rx_6000_rdna2
"Drivers stable??? hahahaha

I love AMD but their drivers suck donkey balls",rx_6000_rdna2
"yeah it's not an easy sell, Most likely better raytracing performance and DLSS for 50 bucks more?",rx_6000_rdna2
You would pay $50 more for a card with 6 gb less vram that uses more power and performs near identically?,rx_6000_rdna2
But you can't. AMD and Nvidia are both going to be completely OOS for months. They could have charged $900.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Gotta wait for Gamers Nexus, Jayz and Linus on that one",rx_6000_rdna2
RTX is propietary...,rx_6000_rdna2
"More like the RTX 3070 has been made DOA due to the 6800, that is why Nvidia is comming up with the 3070 Ti",rx_6000_rdna2
Agreed 100%,rx_6000_rdna2
"Pricing is indeed borderline. You get 16gb but no dlss, then again if you get zen3 you get better performance. But 650$ if 50$ more than I hoped for.",rx_6000_rdna2
"I think if they have a good stock situation at launch the pricing on the 6800xt is fine( assuming actual reviews back up their claims) as for the 6800 I agree, it should be $500 or slightly above.",rx_6000_rdna2
I'm hoping the pricing means they have actual supply to avoid the Nvidia launch disaster.,rx_6000_rdna2
You can't expect them to always undercut Nvidia at this point anymore (the prices of Zen3 reflected that already). They have somewhat of a competitive product with the promise of more features coming out later in the future. You're kinda banking on that.,rx_6000_rdna2
pricing might change after Nvidia gives its response.  We need to wait.,rx_6000_rdna2
"That's what I was saying while watching it -- the biggest edge AMD could create with the 6800 XT is to have better shelf availability than the 3080 and they'll win. 

If they struggle with availability and the pricing is only $50 less, it's not as compelling

That being said, it's really impressive how much ground they gained in one generation. RDNA 1 didn't complete with nvidia on the high end at all",rx_6000_rdna2
"\> The 6800 at $580 is priced too close to the 6800XT. I don't see a compelling reason to get it over the 6800XT.

This is probably what they are banking on lol",rx_6000_rdna2
Probably deliberate - if defect rates on TSMC 7nm are as low as people predict they‚Äôd be disabling otherwise 6800XT/6900XT chips to fulfill demand,rx_6000_rdna2
"They'll likely announce Microsoft's ML AI as their scaled, Nvidia based DLSS around Microsoft's idea.",rx_6000_rdna2
AMDLSS will come just not at launch. They're still working on it and most likely will be a software update (thankfully).

"> The 6800 at $580 is priced too close to the 6800XT. I don't see a compelling reason to get it over the 6800XT.

Wonder why you feel all of a sudden the urge to spend 50 bucks more....
Kinda like the 6800 only exists for that reason, huh?

And on DLSS, ye it is great if the game has it. But since its tied to NVIDIA, more games will not have it than will have it, just like with RTX so far.",rx_6000_rdna2
"No way AMD is going to show DLSS results, that gives NVIDIA a 40% advantage. Plus ray tracing must be tanking their cards since they didn‚Äôt show any numbers for that.",rx_6000_rdna2
The gap is going to widen with rtx.  They would have made a point to tell us it was on.  I hope they are pretty close but didn't want to show a bunch of losses on the graphs.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Same, most I can spend on a GPU is like 400$ and that's if it's amazing",rx_6000_rdna2
"What do you mean? Like a discount for 5700XT owners? Because they never did anything like that, nor Nvidia.

If you mean new features for the 6000 series that might trickle down to RDNA 1 cards, it doesn't seem that way as of now. The new features seem hardware bound and are exclusive to the new generation.",rx_6000_rdna2
Your resale value is still decent because the 6800 is $580. Does that count?,rx_6000_rdna2
Need more spatula!,rx_6000_rdna2
Its the card most in need of AIB designs. Despite AMD saying it uses 300w its going to use way more then 300w.,rx_6000_rdna2
"What? AMD is not like Nvidia. They don't make their own GPU boards, they traditionally partner with sapphire to make their reference models. We most likely get AIB models.",rx_6000_rdna2
I‚Äôd buy the stock if I‚Äôd get the 6900XT tbh.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Probably will but not at launch, supply's limited",rx_6000_rdna2
"I was actually a bit surprised by their lineup. I mean, I'm very impressed but I totally expected a 6700 as well. Personally I tend to go for the ""middle"" card - not the lowest/cheapest model but also not the flagship top-of-the-line model either.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Their lower tier chips are undoubtedly being used in next gen consoles, so it should be a while before we see 6600 or 6700 cards.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Except for maybe the 6800. I think it being $80 more than the 3070 will make it a bit of a harder sell.

Of course wait for the real world benchmarks as well, but I might have to get a 3070 due to wallet reasons.",rx_6000_rdna2
6800 is 15% more than 3070.,rx_6000_rdna2

"I haven't tried it for streaming, but isn't VCE a reasonable solution? I'm not saying it's as good as NVENC, but I use my 5700xt for my non-streaming video encoding, and it works better than my 1070 did (like 50% faster).",rx_6000_rdna2
"NVIDIAs nvenc codecs are a godsend, but I think AMD is doing what they've always done. They're late to the game but they play it well, they'll catch up eventually with a better answer but for not your best bet is probably NVIDIA.",rx_6000_rdna2

"I agree but I don't stream, so it doesn't bother me.",rx_6000_rdna2
"There are zero benchmarks outside the ones from AMD. You should really wait and see what those 3rd party benchmarks look like first. That might mean you don't get a 6900xt on launch, but that's preferable over selling what you have now vs. taking a gamble on a product no one knows anything about.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Mate just wait it out and sell the 3080 later, that's what I'm going to do, 3080 is probably going to be 1000$ until January 2021",rx_6000_rdna2
Just hang on to it. Odds are the scalpers are going to go crazy with Big Navi as well.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Unlikely, at least for now. They still keep 5700XT in production, and it is a totally different price bracket. Until they stop production and add 6700 XT then we will see.",rx_6000_rdna2

"I doubt cards of either manufacturer will reach such low budget this generation as MSRP goes. You have plenty of options already, though.

I think I got like 7-8% on my 3090 with overclock.. Its really not that much different since its essentially a GPU overclock on top of that. This was just an excuse to put GPU overclocks on a slide as far as I can see. One game went outside normal bounds but that was it.

Still sticking to my 3090 and getting a 5950x though. Lack of ray tracing being talked about and DLSS on top of that makes me wonder how the little difference will change when it matters.",rx_6000_rdna2
"The 3070 has less vram and is roughly a 2080ti. 3070 is a scam by marketing it ""2x perf"" when real third party benchmarks showed that the 3070 only beat the 2080ti by not that much. Sometimes the ti is even better than the 3070.

When AMD release proper benchmarks and not just ""2x perf"" it actually show that the 6800 just boss the 2080ti (3070). 6800 has more vram better clockspeed. AmD are not the market leader in gpu so if they Price the 6800 at 580 dollars then it means they are really confident about that card",rx_6000_rdna2
They compared it to a 2080ti cause there aren‚Äôt any numbers for the 3070 yet,rx_6000_rdna2
Think they compared it against 2080ti due to Nvidia pushing back the launch and obviously amd aren't exactly being sent reviewers samples for the card,rx_6000_rdna2
Nvidias msrp is a lie though... sure a few people will get a 3070 for 500 but the majority will be paying $550-$600 because they can‚Äôt find a founders edition. Also the 6800 looks to be the more powerful card so I really don‚Äôt think the pricing is bad,rx_6000_rdna2

3070 is equal or worse to the 2080ti. 2080ti still has considerable more VRAM and much more tensor cores.

Comparing 6800 to the 2080ti was the only choice, but also the best one. 3070 is a 2080ti killer not because it's better, but because it's roughly the same for less than half the price.

6800 for 550$, with more performance and double the VRAM the 3070 has, is extremely competitive.",rx_6000_rdna2

Their charts definitely showed more wins than losses, but the language they used didn't back that up. They showed the 6800XT beating the 3080 is most of those graphs but still just said ""it's competitive"". Still a very good chance they lose in the overall average in 3rd party benchmarks, and when you consider it's only $50 cheaper and will definitely be slower in RT with a DLSS competitior far off.

[deleted],rx_6000_rdna2
Not really. It's pretty fair when you consider it around 15-20% faster than 2080Ti (and of course 3070). And has double amount of VRAM,rx_6000_rdna2
"For way better performance then a 2080ti, I wouldn‚Äôt really say so",rx_6000_rdna2
"The XT has 20% more CU, and some higher clocks, but only costs 12% more... it's a bit out of line yeah",rx_6000_rdna2
It because they want you to buy the 6800XT,rx_6000_rdna2
Hard to say until we see some benchmarks. It looks like the argument is going to boil down to raw performance vs. DLSS/RTX.,rx_6000_rdna2
"If you want to look at it backwards, the 6800 non XT has the most VRAM per $",rx_6000_rdna2
"You do know, ton of ppl had problems with 3080? Like manufacturers not getting enough time to test and therefore some cards might have hardware problems?",rx_6000_rdna2
Exactly. My 5700xt was the biggest headache I've ever had in my PC. Sold it to someone who wanted to tinker with it and bought a 2070s and haven't looked back since. I love Ryzen processors but I just don't know if I'll be able to go with AMD card for a while.,rx_6000_rdna2
They don't look to be the same level of performance to be fair.,rx_6000_rdna2
6800 seems to be a clear winner vs 3070 with 16gb instead of 8... The question is why am I not paying 70 dollars more for the 6800xt.,rx_6000_rdna2
Double the vram though,rx_6000_rdna2
">Because performance wise they are the same.

That's not true at all based on the charts. Yesterday's reviews show the 3070 virtually tied with the 2080ti, while AMD claims the 6800 is 18% (?) better than the 2080ti.",rx_6000_rdna2
Only games where 3070 was equal to 6080 was division 2 and wolfenstein young blood.,rx_6000_rdna2
"The 6800 could be upto 15% faster, they are not in the same tier. + 16GB VRAM",rx_6000_rdna2
How are they ‚Äûsame‚Äú performance-wise?,rx_6000_rdna2
"Because it is a way better card, the 3070 is at best a 2080ti.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Because you're getting 16gb of DDR6 vs 8gb, that's a lot of memory for $50. If you plan on staying at 1080p, you're 100% fine and 8gb will be plenty. Othetwise, don't expect to be able to enable ALL the bells and whistles in big gpu intensive games.",rx_6000_rdna2
"The 6800 is far superior to the 3070 in performance, looking to be 10% to 20% faster. Plus, 16gb VRAM. Definitely worth the $80 extra.",rx_6000_rdna2
supply n demand,rx_6000_rdna2
"I‚Äôm wondering if it has to do with supply. Maybe they intend to drop the price later as manufacturers are able to make enough of them on the cheap. 

But that‚Äôs just wild speculation from me. Lol",rx_6000_rdna2
meh my buddies only turn on RTX to show it then disable it for performance. (they own 2080Ss),rx_6000_rdna2
"People dont realize how important ray tracing is. Ray tracing and path tracing is the last step towards photorealism.

We view the world through lights. Ray tracing basically reverse engineers that. Meanwhile rasterization converts 3D into 2D images",rx_6000_rdna2
"DLSS and ray tracing or equivalent is an absolute must have for any new card.

When the 2x series released it was just something cool, but now with the 3x and the new consoles doing ray tracing it is mandatory. If these cards can‚Äôt do ray tracing to match nvidia then they are a fail imo.",rx_6000_rdna2
Add to the fact that DLSS is a future proof tech that AMD doesn't have yet.,rx_6000_rdna2

AMD's next wave will be a smaller die as well and be a lot cheaper to make -- 12GB GDDR6 and 40 CU at high-ish clocks,  It will probably be slightly slower than the 3070  (think 2080S) but about $429 for the higher end variant (6700XT) and 36CU at about $379 (6700).

Down stack from that, and likely released after all the above, we'll be getting 8GB cards in the $200 to $300 range with performance better than the 5700.  Think 5700XT performance, with RT , etc, at 5600XT prices, and 5600XT performance at 5500XT prices.

We know Navi 21 (256bit bus), Navi 22 (192 bit bus), Navi 23 (128 bit bus) and Navi 24 (64 bit bus) all exist and will likely release in that order, about 6 to 8 weeks apart.",rx_6000_rdna2

Nevertheless, the 6900 XT price is too good, and it makes sense, anyone looking to get an 6900 XT will probably upgrade their other parts as well. 

While NVIDIA innovated early with RTX/DLSS, AMD is going their usual route waiting for broader support, and Microsoft + game devs to implement DX12 features for DXR. Still awaiting word on DLSS equivalent.",rx_6000_rdna2
"To be clear the graphs showed smart access, and rage mode on the 6800 and the 6900xt. 6800XT doesn't show any of those things turned on. So I think the comment you quoted is slightly misleading.

Also yes DLSS and Ray Tracing does matter but to what extent it largely depends from user to user. Some people want all of the features and want it with ray tracing. Others value higher frame rates above anything else. It's why 1440p is considered the sweet spot because you can achieve higher visual fidelity than 1080p but still hit 120fps+ in games.

DLSS is something quite frankly AMD doesn't have an answer for and the longer time goes on the better DLSS gets
So will have to see how that plays out.

All in all I think this is healthy competition. if anyone thought for a second that AMD was going to come out and smash nvidia then they were playing themselves. Nvidia has been pushing the boundaries and setting the bar. What we saw today was what we hoped for which is better competition across all pricing skus though admittedly the 6800 is definitely a weird one.

I think the 6800XT head to head against the 3080 looks pretty damn good. The question comes down to availability and how much a person values those other features. The 6800 I probably wouldn't go for seeing as how the 3070 is a better value proposition. The 6900XT im just excited because AMD is willing to get into the ring against nvidias biggest and baddest.

Personally im still going to lean towards the 3080 for the rig im currently building. The biggest issue is not being able to actually give them my money for one.

But obviously wait for reviews and benchmarks. With that said I think this is a great thing for pc gaming overall.",rx_6000_rdna2

Not quite true.

The 2080ti vs 6800 chart had SAM enabled, the 3080 vs 6800XT had nothing enabled, the 3090 vs 6900 had SAM + Auto OC enabled.

When its competitive online multiplayer, ray tracing will be rarely used if ever due to the impact in FPS performance. I can see where it can be great for non competitive games or in single player campaigns.

With DLSS, it's basically up to to the developers if they will implement it. So for the games I've been playing like Warzone, Apex Legends, and other competitive games--it hasn't been implemented in either of those as of now.

Because it's not an entry level card,rx_6000_rdna2
20% better than 2080ti puts it half way between a 3070 and 3080 so it should be $600 but they are selling it for $580. It's not over priced but it's not as much of a saving compared to the xt vx 3080,rx_6000_rdna2
"Well it's $50 cheaper than the 3700, but the 3700 has 8GB and the 6800 has 16GB, so the idea there is that people will spend the bit extra to get significantly more.  


Overall yeah this time around the range is more expensive, but that's because AMD can actually compete on the same level for once.",rx_6000_rdna2
maybe $549 would be more appropriate.,rx_6000_rdna2
"OK, what 16GB card is faster and costs less?

Both cards are based on the same silicon, and have the same amount of memory. Some cores are disabled, and clock speeds are slightly slower. The 7nm TMSC process is pretty mature, there may not be a lot of slightly defective/lower performing dice they can harvest for 6800. So that would make the 6800 cost AMD about the same to make as the 6800XT, which explains the relatively narrow gap between the 6800 and the 6800 XT. AMD wants you to buy the XT, because that extra $70 is gravy to them. When the 6700 and 6700XT comes out next year you'll get the sub $500 card you're looking for.",rx_6000_rdna2

seems like the comments say it was typo,rx_6000_rdna2
"I think they made a typo and that it is the 3090. Look at borderlands 3, the rtx 3080 delivers 62.1 fps according to nvidia, wheras in amd's slides the card delivers around ~68 to 70 fps, which would be more in line with 3090 performance",rx_6000_rdna2

Gddr6X is Nvidia developed. Amd literally couldn't have implemented it if they wanted to. 

Gddr6X on the 3080 supports up to 19.5 GB/s compared to 16 on ddr6. This difference only matters if the card can actually process and push enough data through. 

Gddr6X isn't inherently better if AMD have an answer to it. Which it does. In infinity cache.

Very few games support ray tracing as of right now and even in some games that do the effect is so minimal (looking at you COD modern warfare)

Side note:  I owned a 2080 and now own a 3080, mostly for performance. Had I known AMD would match in performance I would not have purchased a 3080.

No concrete dlss competitor yet and not much RT news or benchmarks shown. Seems a bit fishy 

I hope it's gonna be close but we will have to see

I would say the rx 6800 is the best deal of the stack. Since as you go up in price the more key those AI cores Nvidia has becomes.

So while on launch day a Ryzen 5900x and a Rx 6900xt will be a screaming deal in raw performance and top end performance it will not age as well as the 3090 in productivity. And that is who is looking to drop that kind of money on a gpu mostly.",rx_6000_rdna2

"I disagree. Zen 1 was WAY behind Intel equivalents in clock speeds and gaming, while price was much cheaper. That seems more like RDNA1 or even GCN which are both way cheaper than they cards they seem to compete with. But, they both offer decent performance just not up there with NVIDIA's offerings.

2080Ti was a 1200$ card and a lot of people have bought it. Same can happen with 6900. Having a card that matches best competitor's card is a nice marketing overall and may pull the buyers. Also nVidia have shortage problems so there is that too.,rx_6000_rdna2

"Nvidia would need to increase supply and show that consumers still want their cards, then prices would drop.",rx_6000_rdna2
They don't need todrop prices. They are already beating nvidia. All it comes down to is availability. If you can't even find a 3080 you wont get one for close to msrp. If amd keeps up with demand you alrady get your extra 100 less ;),rx_6000_rdna2
"IIRC the 3090 doesn't have any professional optimizations.

It's not a Titan, no matter that Nvidia likes to compare it to one.",rx_6000_rdna2
Why is the 3090 being priced $500 above the 6900XT okay because it has 8GB more VRAM but the 6800 being priced $80 above the 3070 is not even though it also has 8GB more VRAM?,rx_6000_rdna2
"I think AMD missed their pricing with the 6800. But it makes sense, I think they don't want to price it too low because nobody would buy the 6800XT without lowering the price of that. I mean I don't see the reason to buy a 6800XT because I game at 1440p, but for not a lot more I can get it instead of a 6800. I think AMD wants to shift more of the 6800XT GPUs.",rx_6000_rdna2
"The 3070 uses 50 less watts as well. Better price/performance and less power consumption. It only uses 50 more watts than my Rx480 to get double the frames.

So I still think the 3070 is going to be my next upgrade.

Currently only at 1080p 144hz but there's some games like Squad where I'm only getting 50fps at 100% GPU usage and 60% CPU usage. And that's with settings already turned down and my GPU overclocked. 

Still on an i7 4790k which I will upgrade to a 5000 series AMD CPU eventually. But re-investing in ram and getting a new motherboard plus an M.2 SSD is a bit out of reach for me right now. But I can swing $500 for a GPU. 

Something like this but with a 5000 series CPU ~ $1500 total so $500 now for the GPU. $1000 later for the CPU/platform upgrade. Then another $500ish for a 1440p monitor further down the line.

Depends on use case for the 6800. It'll be a better 4k card in the long run than the 3070 by a long shot as it has double the VRAM,rx_6000_rdna2
what did u expect man. they are both corporations,rx_6000_rdna2
"The price climb we are witnessing has more to do with the huge increase in gamers we have seen over the last decade and founderies (chip ""printers""), like GlobalFounderies, backing out of the new advanced nodes like 7nm etc. Resulting in more demand and less suppliers. Covid probably also had an impact on graphicscard production, making it even worse.

The way Nvidia and AMD are handling this is predictable. They want to sell all the cards they make at the highest profitmargin they can get away with.   
But with demand going up, the founderies backing out of more advanced nodes. This is the way the wind is blowing and will continue to until TMSC sees some competition in the Foundery space.

6800 XT >= 3080 (and $50 cheaper)

Tbh I wonder if this AMD's strat this gen of gpu might end up with them losing the gpu battle much more than they think. They still have the inferior feature suite relative to nvidia in terms of CUDA, DLSS, and likely in raytracing as well. The price to performance ratio isnt significantly better enough to necessarily warrant the switch for lots of nvidia gpu users. If anything, the 5700xt vs 2070(s) has shown that even with somewhat sjmilar performance at 20%/25% price difference, people will still end up picking nvidia.",rx_6000_rdna2

They are analogous to nvidias sm units,rx_6000_rdna2
AMD Compute Unit = NVIDIA Streaming Processor.,rx_6000_rdna2
Each compute unit (CU) has many different stream processors inside along with other components (might be where they are putting the ray tracing bits too). The stream processors are similar to cuda cores and I believe it is 64 stream processors per CU. This would mean an increase of 512 streams going from 72 to 80 which seems to translate to a pretty decent performance uplift going from the graphs.,rx_6000_rdna2

Why are people making out like blurring the fuck out of your image is some fantastic feature?

I'll buy the card that works at the speed I want in native res and ignore shit that blurs my image quality to claim to be higher res. If it's blurry it literally doesn't mean anything.

"\> 6800 xt is better than 3080 hands down

I have a 3090 so I gain nothing from saying this but...

Its debatable. One - we need to see benches.

Two. Its very likely these cards underperform with ray tracing - ignore DLSS. It doesn't have the hardware that NVIDIA has for raytracing \[RT Cores\]. It wouldn't surprise me if they are a gen behind with ray tracing without DLSS brought into equation.

I do think 6800 XT has a place and it can be better for many / perhaps most. Hands down?

That remains to be seen. I am going to say its unlikely.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Wasn't the 3090 not original billed as a gaming card, but a workhorse card for 3d rendering and such? And the only reason the slapped '4k gaming card' on it was because of the amd leak? I could be wrong but I remember Moores law is dead or gamers nexus talking about it.",rx_6000_rdna2
">6800 xt is better than 3080 hands down.

Serious question, I've been trying to buy a 3080 with no luck. The Nvidia guys are saying the 3080 is better because of dlss and ray tracing along with other software features. Why do you say the 6800 xt is better?(real question as to the features that make it better)",rx_6000_rdna2
"It's better on avg in those gamers they chose to show, but they never outright claimed it was faster than the 3080...you really need to pay attention to wording. We know Nvidia is even more guilty of this. For Zen3 they said something about ""the fatest gaming performance"" every other sentence. For this reveal they were very careful to just say ""competitive"" and ""faster than any of our previous cards"" even if their graphs clearly showed it was better.",rx_6000_rdna2
So Nvidia graphics still remain superior?,rx_6000_rdna2

Thing is, with all of these marketing names, it is hard to tell whats what. Though I have to say, comparing to a 3090 while the own card is overclocked is a bit misleading. 

I think I will consider these cards...after a lot of reviews. 

The lack of digs against nVidia when it comes to availability is a bit concerning.

We shall see. I got time. I can wait.

Steve Burke is probably already at it.

Edit: sUpErReSolUtiOn and SAM and rAgE ModE. Goddamn! What does any of that mean? Rage Mode seems to be some weird factory overclock. Which makes no sense. If it is their card and they know that is their headroom, why not make it the default?

But it isn't? They showed very close performance between the 3080 and the 6800XT, they showed the 6900XT clearly beating the 3090 by a comfortable margin (about 10%) and they showed the 6800 demolishing the 2080Ti (roughly equivalent to the 3070 which by now we know is ever so slightly slower than the 2080 Ti, like 2%), a very decent margin that looks like at least 15%.

All that could make a significant difference is DLSS and when/if AMD comes up with a worthy competitor to it, which in the video they did say they are working on such a technology.

When it comes to rasterization, you could compare the 6800 to the rumored 3070 Ti, but  it definitely beats the 3070.",rx_6000_rdna2

It seems to be a better way for the CPU to reach the VRAM in the GPU.

On a normal scenario, the Memory controller inside the GPU manages what is written on VRAM, this is probably going to skip that and let the CPU write directly to VRAM, letting the GPU work more on graphics. It may be a special/new instruction on the CPU, so the driver knows this instruction and when the CPU executes it the GPU knows to let it write it directly to VRAM. When Dr Su said that Developers can optimize this, then it sure sounds like a special/new instruction that can also be coded in the game and not let just the driver do it.",rx_6000_rdna2

Most Nvidia features are cool but with flaws, drawbacks, or extremely game specific which make them hard buy unless you like those specific games or buy into marketing. That's why NVENC is so good, great performing and it doesn't have specific requirements.

I'm not sure if that means those features were used or adding them would give more perf. but I think in this example you might be right.

This is a good point. This is a marketing move to push people towards a 6800xt or a 6900xt. The 6800xt beats the 2080 but third party benchmarks will probably reveal very similar performance. The 6900 trades with the 3090 and does so at a significantly lower MSRP. 

And with an 80 dollar price hike over the 3070 which will inevitably be scalped into oblivion, is it really a huge loss that their *lowest performance* GPU thus far suffers a 16% higher price than its direct competitor when the 3070 will remain unavailable UFN?

mad lads indeed,rx_6000_rdna2
"I mean this is probably exactly why Nvidia is already working on a 3080ti for around $1k. They got wind of the 6900XT, saw the boost clock, lower TDP, and probsvly figured it would be very close to the 3090.

"AMD conceded that their RT performance penalty is greater than Nvidia's by not talking about those penalties; at the higher end, people will care more about RT than in the lower brackets so the 6900XT will not take too much business away from the 3090.

BUT, my interpretation is that their plan is to have a DLSS answer in Q1-2021, which means that the picture will be very different if they can remove themselves from its implementation; that is to say, if AMD can improve RT performance without requiring studios to partner with them for some machine learning solution like Nvidia does, the picture drastically changes once there is a 3080ti even if the penalties are still somewhat higher, since more games will benefit from a (most likely) less performant DLSS-like solution...

If I'm reading this correctly, the 999 price is meant to force Nvidia's hand on the 3080ti a few months into the future, and does not reflect an intention of capturing 3090 buyers right now.

Now, I don't know how the RTX 30-series RTX performance scaling compares to its DXR performance scaling, we would need to see their numbers in this DXR test.

"AMD does have hardware based RT though. Linus stated in his new video that every compute unit has a ""ray accelerator"" built into it. That sounds like hardware to me.",rx_6000_rdna2
"I'm just speaking for myself. I care about ray-tracing at 4k. I want all the rays traced. I want every pixel in HDR. I want frames on frames on frames. If I could find a 3090 at MSRP, I would have already bought one by now. I've had Cyberpunk 2077 preordered for over a year, and I want to crank everything to max for the best experience possible.

Honestly, if the 6900XT or 3080 can pull a rock solid 60fps at 4k raytracing on in that game, I'll buy one. Otherwise, if I find a 3090 before benchmarks come out, I'm buying one of those.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Yes really. It's going to be a more common feature of games going forward. And I care about it, so it's relevant to my interests.",rx_6000_rdna2
"If you're spending north of $500 on a GPU you're an enthusiast. Most enthusiasts that early adopt do care about features that will future proof them. AMD has definitely beaten Nvidia big time on price vs performance, and will likely eat up market share big time if they can get supply out. That being said, it's not like Nvidia sat on their asses and did nothing, they did come out with some sick cards even if they are to some degree overpriced.

Overall, the consumer wins in this instance. AMD is going to force Nvidia to start aggressively pricing and not gouging the shit out of everyone like per usual.",rx_6000_rdna2
Really? That's super awesome to hear!! Streaming and driver support are my to areas of hesitancy with Radeon graphics but if those are both cleared up you'll find me in line on launch to grab a 6800XT!!,rx_6000_rdna2
"That's false. Newer AMD cards have [dedicated video encoding and decoding pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Coding_Engine) that's supported pretty widely nowadays.

You can configure the encoder to use VCE in OBS, ShareX etc.

(Granted, NVEC encoding produces visually clearer video w/ similar settings)",rx_6000_rdna2
"AMD VCE has been in the pipeline since the 7900 series.

How do you think you can record the last few min of gameplay?

The same way you stream, with the VCE code. Have you actually streamed on an AMD GPU because that‚Äôs just outright false information at best.

And of course it works with OBS, it‚Äôs a codec installed by the GPU drivers so it will work system wide not just in the driver software:",rx_6000_rdna2
I know right. Sadly I've heard of some stability problems with  AMD GPUs. Hopefully they are fixed with the new cards.,rx_6000_rdna2
"at 1440p I think the 6800 will be actually a pretty decent offering. Amd claims 18% higher performance than the 2080ti at 1440p (albeit with smart access memory turned on) on average.

Meanwhile hardware unboxed tested the 3080 to be 21% faster than the 2080ti on average at 1440p.

I think they priced it like that because the 6800 is closer to the 6800xt than we think, especially at 1440p. Taking amds numbers to be optimistic maybe it'll be more like 10-15% ahead of a 2080ti and so offers a mid point in performance.",rx_6000_rdna2
"But it also has no DLSS and probably worse RayTracing, so it's a heavy tradeoff. Not to mention that at 1440P (where this card would fully shine) 8GB is going to be plenty for the next 2-3 years.

The 6800xt tdp is only 20w less than the 3080 right?,rx_6000_rdna2
That's only 15% price reduction compared to 3080. Considering that they have already done a 32 - 35% price cut over 3090 with 6900 XT. I would say $600 6800 XT is far from unrealistic.,rx_6000_rdna2

"I get that if we trust AMDs numbers it beats the 3070 in straight rendering but no DLSS and we will see about other things like raytracing, but also it leaves AMD with their cheapest card at $579 in a likely pretty bad price/perf when compared to the 6800xt and probably 3080.",rx_6000_rdna2
Yea that's probably what I'm most in the market for but rocking an R9 390 right now so hard to be patient,rx_6000_rdna2

and who said it was?,rx_6000_rdna2
"yeah not quite 20%. Amd claimed about 18% uplift vs the 2080ti at 1440p with smart access memory enabled. Still that's a pretty decent margin, and maybe not that far off the 3080/6800xt",rx_6000_rdna2

That's exactly what my thoughts were when seeing the price.,rx_6000_rdna2
Not the slide comparing the 3080ntonthe 6800xt. Those benchmarks were done without rage mode and smart access. It was a direct head to head.,rx_6000_rdna2

"I have a 1080 ti with 11gb of ram and I just think it's weird that the higher end 3080 has less vram. Before all these announcements, I thought all the high end cards would have 16 gb of ram. Also, the gap between the 10gb 3080 and 24gb 3090 is really big.",rx_6000_rdna2

Yea. Im just confused why people are complaining about the price when we have all of that vram and better performance. I just dont see the 6800 as aiming for the 3070 target audience. As its clearly a sort of middle ground card between 3070 and 3080. (Maybe a 3070ti),rx_6000_rdna2
Apparently the 3070ti got canceled,rx_6000_rdna2
"**It‚Äôs cheaper than the 3080** which launches at $699, I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs disappointing.

Nvidia would just lower prices to $599 and then **nobody would buy the 6800XT** unless AMD forces their own prices down thus hurting themselves.

Also $599 back in 2016 is around $649 in todays money, and keep in mind the R9 Fury X released around 2015 for $649(INF: $713) & compare that in todays money you‚Äôre get** 16GB VRAM, 4k60 ready Smart Memory Access, Ray Tracing, etc.**

For $60 less.

I‚Äôd say the 6800XT is at a pretty good price especially **considering the 3080 costs more.**

">1. Nope. All those fancy bar graphs gonna fly out the window with DLSS 2.0 turned on

"That's true as well. 
I'm mostly looking to build a 1440p and/or 1080p high refresh rate build as well.

Availability might be a factor but lets see. In my country 1$=1.5 times the currency due to import duties etc.

If this matches or is just a hair behind 3090, with less power consumption and no GDDR6X setup, it is a major win for AMD

"Most reviews show about a 3% fps in decrease from the 2080ti to the 3070, which seems to suggest that they are basically equal cards.

 Also one of the biggest things these cards (Ampere and Navi 2) was ray tracing, since their implementation is basically becoming more mainstream. As much as I want to applaud AMD for an amazing job, they completely ignored this performance metric. 

Lastly, we don't know whether we don't know if they ran DLSS for those benchmarks, which is quite a big performance uplift for Nvidia. Also they had some graphs with their AMD boost thing (i forgot what it was calles) which shifts things further into their field.",rx_6000_rdna2

In the meantime, I'm eyeing a monitor at Black Friday (IPS with good response time): either 1080p 144Hz for 200$ (or less) or 1440p 144Hz for 400$ (or less) and take it from there.",rx_6000_rdna2

Those consoles are an insane value. I grabbed a vega 56 months back when it hit $199 and just can't justify spending $600 on a GPU so I'll be sitting this one out. Luckily this card still pushes my monitor just fine for the time being and could do so for another year if that's what it takes. These GPUs are monsters but the entire value proposition has been skewed.,rx_6000_rdna2
"> gaming is dead from a value perspective, it's all about enthusiasts dropping 999$ for GPUs right now considering it ""a great value"" and ""price war"".

This is facts. I'm not trying to spend over 650 CAD, but it seems that's just not possible. Seeing the sheer amount of neckbeards screaming and cooming over these prices makes me cringe so hard. There are people saying the 6900XT is value. Like no, just because it undercuts the 3090 by 500 dollars doesn't make it ""worth"" the fact is that it's still 1k USD. Both of these cards are basically the equivalent of designer clothing at this point, the performance they advertise are basically null as less than 0.1% of pc gamers will play ray tracing supported games at 4k above 144hz. The people on the live and on this reddit saying ""rip nvidia"" are so fucking cringe it's crazy, anyone who even entertains buying gpus at this price point doesn't care about value or cost to performance--despite some of them acting like they do.",rx_6000_rdna2
"I wouldn't call it dead but PC gaming is not a clear value winner today. GTX 970 was released 7 years ago for a bit over 300$ - that card absolutely killed games in 1080p and it's usable today in that resolution (my friend is playing Battlefield 5 60fps in High to ultra settings, wtf). 

If I wanted to buy a 4k capable GPU today... 500$ RTX 3070 is good enough if I skip ray tracing in most demanding titles and go for high instead of ultra in some games today. But what about next year? Or 2022? 500$ doesn't futureproof me at all. And that's just the GPU - the new Ryzen lineup is not cheap either. I guess it will takes us one, two, maybe more more generations of GPUs to see that true 4k value card (just in time for decently priced DDR5 ram too!).

 I'm sure that 1440p players will get their 3060/6700 soon - 1440p looks kinda strange on my 4k tv though so dropping money on this resolution is not for me. But I'm sure it will be worth it for those who enjoy this res.

4k/60fps in not going to be a standard (still hoping!) but the upcoming consoles are awesome when it comes to value right now - I'm sure it will change over the years when they will start to struggle and PC will once again become relevant for frugal gamers but for now PS5/XSX are the way to go for budget oriented people.",rx_6000_rdna2

I think the 'multipurpose thing' may be it - it's their attempt to deflect miners from buying up 6800XTs, especially if they put the lion's share of stock on that card. Gamers will either go up or down, you get so much more with the 6800XT or save $160 between the XT and the 3070.

I actually can't wait to see benchmarks for these cards with and without their extra features.

We know how Navi performs with SAM and Rage mode on but Ampere's killer feature, DLSS, was flipped off and it was running at stock clocks so Navi had a bit of an advantage.

I'd like to see them benchmarked on Intel systems to see how much Rage mode and SAM boosted Navi.

I have a feeling that nvidia is going to come back with a vengeance once the 3000ti versions of Ampere are ready, especially if they use the same TSMC 7nm node as Navi.

As it stands now, 6900 XT and 6800 XT seem like the better choice for people that don't care as much about Raytracing.

3080 is the best choice for people who care about Raytracing.

3070 is the best overall bang for buck card but only barely. 6800 is practically tied with it.

With AMD, I just installed the drivers and started X. Of course, I was much more familiar with the inner workings of X by then.

Also, I'm a huge fan of Sway and Wayland compositors in general, so I'm pretty heavily invested in AMD.

In fact, the only thing that could make me buy an Nvidia card would be if they added [SR-IOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-root_input/output_virtualization) to their consumer cards before AMD. Something I doubt will happen anytime soon. But that would only make my buy the card for my Proxmox server, not my gaming PC.

Changed cables, PSU, entire systems and Vega would still crash. Even bought a second card and sent the original one in, but none of those 3 cards were able to run more than an hour of CS:GO while recording.

They all crashed. Bought a 2080 on clearance: haven't had any problems since.

Do you think after Vega was such a disappointment I would even consider Navi? Especially since there were a bunch of reports about flickering, DX9 games not working properly and crashes. Even the HWU survey showed that AMD had a serious problem back then. And now that I've seen the green side I might not even consider Radeon for a long time, since fiddling with drivers and Wattman is just not as fun to me as a working GPU.

"Right now I have a 5700 XT and an i7-7700k. I'll have to say, using x264 on ""very fast"" settings is taxing on my pc. Getting a host or raid drops FPS like mad for a good 3 seconds. I also get consistent frame drops just doing regular gaming while streaming. So I recently ordered a 2070 super from EVGA after reading about the step-up program they have (to get maybe a 3080) and then I planned on selling the 5700 XT.

"> ima guess that the 3090 is gonna blow the 6900XT out of the water

I mean, look at what Ryzen did to Intel's overpriced processors.

If the 6900XT provides performance anywhere NEAR to the 3090 AMD doesn't have to make it as good as a 3090, the price:performance ratio is going to blow the 3090 out of the water.  $1499 is a ludicrous price that NVIDIA is only charging because there isn't competition on the high end.",rx_6000_rdna2
"What is this based on? AMD's presentation indicated that the 6900xt was on par with the 3090 in rasterisation if not better.

The 6800xt was in a similar state against the 3080, except in 1440p it took a 5 percent lead.

And the 6800 was clearly ahead of the 3070 (by an average of apparently 17 percent.), as the 2080ti in most benchmarks is as fast or 5 percent faster than the 3070.

All this said, I'm really disappointed not to see any RT performance, and even more disappointed to hear they're simply ""working on"" a super resolution/DLSS competitor. For me DLSS is where the battle is won. If the 6800xt can come within about 15-20 percent of the 3080 at 1440p with RT and DLSS/super resolution on, then I'll be happy to buy.

You might look at exchange rate and say that it's close enough but that's not the case. That $580 6800 will retail in the UK for around ¬£550-580, which in turn will cost me around 610-650 euro. At the very least that's 110 over what I wanted to pay. 

If I can snag a 3070 for ¬£469 it will cost me just over 500 euro which is about as good as I can get for this current gen. 

Will the 6800 be a better card that could potentially hold up for a longer period of time? Yeah it could be, absolutely. 

But will the 3070 fulfil all of my needs for now and the near future for close to my target price? Also yes. 

End of the day, regardless of what I get, it's a win.",rx_6000_rdna2

"Adobe driver crashes are on Adobe, and tbh I wouldn't trust adobe to put out stable products anymore. Ever since they went to a forced subscription model their stability and feature set have been pretty lacklustre.

"Just barely and it costs more too. People are looking at >2080ti performance as the only meaningful metric and they both have that. Nvidia does it for less $$ though.

At least my year has been pretty consistent lol.",rx_6000_rdna2
Really isn't. Raytracing means fuck all in a big ship right now. DLSS is very nice but AMD have adaptive resolution scaling... I'd expect something like DLSS to come along sooner or later from AMD.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Except you can't buy ampere reference, and AIB is way above MSRP. Nvidia launch prices were bait&switch. 

If Navi actually sells for 650 that'd be pretty grand.",rx_6000_rdna2
"We haven't seen the crazy AIB Sapphire and liquid devils cards yet. And big Navi has the headroom power over Nvidia this time. Let's wait and see. 

Unless dlss is supported as a driver feature that can be enabled across most games, big meh. Raytracing on ampere was a disappointment. Excepted 2x better raytraced IPC in games but only got like 20-30%

I don't agree with the 3080 pricing either. And availability remains to be seen for the 6800 series also.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Sorry but it's 2020,not 2010. Mindshare changes much more rapidly now, as the average consumer becomes more of a prosumer and people want value for their money in an industry that's been dominated by a single player for 2 decades. If you want evidence of this shift towards value > brand loyalty, look no further than ryzen's rapid.. ryze (sorry I had to) in the consumer segment.

If these performance claims are even remotely close, amd will reap profits at these price points. Only the consumer loses in a market that has a forthemostpart, single metric performance leader and... The guy in second place at a discount as your only other option.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Which is essentially just a promise of a feature.

And thus isn't a competitor to DLSS, because you can get it right now, but you can't with Super Resolution or whatever. You can't compete with Nvidia if you are just promising 'in the future...'",rx_6000_rdna2
"Which didn't give me much hope to it. If it was actually almost finished or a really good competitor vs DLSS, they would have shown it more.

I think that not talking about it more shows a lack of faith in it.",rx_6000_rdna2
"It's the same 4k perfomance if you count those features and requirement. Smart Access Memory requires a Zen 3 CPU, so if you plan to have one already, then that is cool, otherwise you shouldn't consider it.

And Rage Mode is overclocking, you shouldn't compare overclocked cards(even if it's a feature by the company) vs non overclocked cards.

Then there is also DLSS, NVenc, NVidia Broadcast and etc etc, stuff that AMD has no answer to. And also of course, CUDA itself as that is vastly superior to OpenCL and so anyone who would want to do something like heavy video editing with a top card like the 6900XT or 3090 would view the NVidia option far more favorably.",rx_6000_rdna2
"If all you care is rasterization, then yeah, it's a huge win. Those top cards are overpriced anyway.

I don't really see the 3080 vs 6800 XT as a win though, as in that one, it's only $50 cheaper.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Sure, but this is *with* the new 5000 series CPU's and Smart Cache enabled across x570 boards. I agree on the double VRAM, I missed that and there's obviously some cost there...

AMD simply must be very confident to be a leader in the ""budget"" market now since they're not trying to be the budget option anymore.",rx_6000_rdna2
No. Linus even released a video yesterday showing that the 2080TI is within 2% on average to being a 3070. RTX 3080 is better than 2080TI across the board.,rx_6000_rdna2
Not all gamers.  Not most.,rx_6000_rdna2

The last 2-3 releases already improved massively the stability and bugs in my experience.,rx_6000_rdna2
"I'm eagerly awaiting for the day tech jesus goes live with big navi reviews. I've already gotten a 3080 but it still excites me because nvidia needs a competitor to stop being so damn pompous. Back when AMD was direct competition, nvidia actually had good pricing. The competition this year could cause an arms race. (Which is sorely needed)",rx_6000_rdna2
You're correct and prior to this I just referred to ray tracing as rtx. I corrected it.,rx_6000_rdna2
"How come? It is better then the RTX 3070 yeah, but there are a few caviats here. One is the ray tracing performance which is supposed to be better on Ampere(they also conveniently not mentioned it), the other is no real DLSS competitor.

And DLSS is really a big one, it gives you the ability to get more FPS without much lose of quality(maybe after DLSS the performance is equal).

For the price difference the 6800XT is also a better  option, so there really is no point in getting the 6800.",rx_6000_rdna2

"Neither does nvidia, they also have a partner (probably pny)",rx_6000_rdna2

"Yeah, but its not as close as NVENC when it comes to live encoding at low bitrates.

For example AMD VCE (what the Encoder is called) looks similar to x264 veryfast/superfast, which is really ugly at lower bitrates.

Since NVIDIA's Turing Lineup, they made the NVENC Chip better, and it is on par with x264 medium. 

x264 medium is a huge load when it comes to CPU Encoding. (That's about 80% Usage on a Ryzen 7 3700X on a 1080p 60FPS Encoding)",rx_6000_rdna2
"Yeah, people who don't stream and don't need RTX / Raytracing (for now) can just go with the Radeon GPU's. Before turing GPU's came out I really wanted to buy an AMD GPU, but then NVIDIA came around the corner like the ""Hello motherf\*cker"" meme and brought up RTX Broadcast, better NVENC, etc. and I was like ""Hell nah, I won't get an AMD GPU for now""",rx_6000_rdna2
True. Wouldn't be the first time AMD looked super promising only for it to be smoke in the water,rx_6000_rdna2

Same here mate. Convinced my research group to use our funding to get us 4 3090s but now we need to look into power requirements etc. So we might end up getting 2 or 3 max......if we can given the lack of stock,rx_6000_rdna2
"hah, there's no reason to regret, it's such a small bump that any game playable on 6800XT series will be just as easily playable on 3080. The real difference might end up being raytracing, or if you like to play games with textures set to insane settings where you need a jumbo 4k monitor and to pause the game to see the difference. Yeah, nobody is going to buy a 6800 for machine learning. OpenCL ecosystem just didn't happen, barely made a dent in NVidia markets. Then Apple abandoned it just to spite it I guess.",rx_6000_rdna2

"Double the RAM is huge, but so is DLSS. If they come up with a DLSS competitor soon (they did mention they were working on a new super sampling technology), then it's a huge win for AMD, otherwise the 3070 might be the best choice for below 4k gaming.",rx_6000_rdna2
"VEC is there by default. Has been. If anything that's entirety down to them working out the hardware kinks that were there in the 5000 series

I understand that but I feel like it ignores the fact nvidia‚Äôs bottom card is cheaper. If you were really trying to save you would want the 3070 which has the better encoder and features anyway. Maybe it‚Äôs a bet on nvidia having continued poor stock. Who knows but  performance wise there isn‚Äôt much room for them to decrease for a 6700/xt,rx_6000_rdna2
"Ok so vram isn‚Äôt the be all end all. 

You‚Äôve made up your percentage differences in performance because the 2080 ti figures were left off the 6800 slides. The 3070 performs better in some titles than a 2080ti. Finally the 6800 slide states the figures are with smart access memory on. I‚Äôll wait for real benchmarks but yeah it seems a bad deal. If I want the cheapest new gpu I‚Äôll get a 3070. If I have more to play with I‚Äôll add an extra 80 and get a better 6800xt",rx_6000_rdna2
"Rage mode isn‚Äôt actually an OC. Gamers nexus released a video straight after the release. It‚Äôs effectively the power slider being pushed up (not to the max) 

I definitely think the 3090 is better but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs $500 better. If I wasn‚Äôt a console gamer as well I‚Äôd probably care a lot more About DLSS and RTX and put the extra money I spent on a PS5 on my GPU choice and get a 3090.",rx_6000_rdna2
This is the truth ^,rx_6000_rdna2

"People aren't skeptics of DLSS because they can't see how performant it is, they just don't have a use for it.

For example, if you want to play Cyberpunk, DLSS is worth considering if it takes you from 50fps to 70fps at your desired resolution. If you don't plan on playing a DLSS compatible game, or you already get the framerate you want out of the games you play without it, then you would be just feeding your own FOMO by thinking that you.must.have.DLSS

When you look at it objectively and take off the ""I WANT THE BEST!"" lenses, the only good reason to have a DLSS-or-bust mentality is if you go to Nvidia's website, you look at the list of future DLSS games and your conclusion is ""I will play these games in the future and my current GPU won't give me the framerates I want at the resolution I want""

Software development in general comes with tough choices because you have a finite budget and a finite timeline to deliver; so you choose (and often fight internally) to do the things that will be more valuable to your customers and give you better ROI.

For DLSS to be THAT feature you're thinking of, it should be so easy and cheap to implement that a development studio won't have to cut other things in order to implement it, resulting in generalized adoption.

The same applies to AMD: if their feature involves a similar effort to implement as DLSS, then both features will have a harder time getting widespread adoption and the games that support either tech will just be bullet points on corporate slides.

"Because nobody cares about a couple percent extra performance, which is what the difference is with the normal cards. And in the case of the RX6800/RTX3070 it's 15% more expensive for what looks like at most a couple percent extra performance.

You should take off those red glasses, because I can tell you from someone who doesn't give a fuck about brands that we the consumers are the big losers today. This almost smells like collusion.",rx_6000_rdna2

"if it doesn't exist, then it shouldn't impact your buying decision.  Never buy anything for some promise of future support",rx_6000_rdna2

"That'd leave AMD with a $200 gap between the 6700XT and the $580 6800, which is HUGE.  To me, the next price points are probably:

$479 or $499 : 6700XT  
$449-ish: 6700

Assuming AMD's performance numbers turn out to be true (and they've been basically spot-on for years, so no reason to think otherwise), that kind of pricing is fair considering how well they compete vs. Nvidia at that price point.",rx_6000_rdna2
"That remains to be seen, they showed the comparison to the 2080ti with SAM, which wasn't on for the 6800XT slides. We really need benchmarks.",rx_6000_rdna2
"It's $80 more and for a lot of people, they might not want to spend $500 on a GPU at all.    Going from a $400 5700XT to a $500 3070 looks like it'll net you HUGE performance gains so some people might be talked into the extra $100.  Going the extra $80 might just be too much of an ask.

I'm a little surprised that AMD is willing to concede the $500 GPU market to Nvidia this holiday season.  A $479-$499 6700XT could have been a compelling offer.  (My bet is that the 6700XT will use the same chip as the 6800, and that AMD's yields are good enough where they won't have any substantial # of chips on offer for the foreseeable future.)",rx_6000_rdna2
It doesn't destroy it's less than 10% faster on average but it costs 15% more. That's worse price to performance ratio.,rx_6000_rdna2
"People want and expect value from AMD, especially for the middle gaming segment.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Maybe, but you're looking at $400 for a 5700XT or $499 for a 3070 - the 3070 offers WAYYYYY more than a 20% bump in performance for the 20% more money, not to mention features like ray tracing, etc.

Frankly, if someone asked me what card they should buy next month for **max** $500, I'd tell them a 3070, hands down.  If they couldn't get or couldn't afford a 3070 and they needed a GPU *right then,* I'd probably point them way down the stack to like, a 5500XT for $180 or a 1660 Super for \~$210 or something to tide hold them over until RDNA2 and/or Turing parts in their price range are available.  The performance difference is just that big.",rx_6000_rdna2
Actually for value 3070 is worse due to its low VRAM. However if you don't want to pay that much then you can only do 3070,rx_6000_rdna2
"There are 18 games that support any form of DLSS at all, less that support DLSS 2.0. Based on Steam Hardware and software surveys, DLSS is probably relevant for less than 5% of users.

If you're trying to make that argument, you would be better off enabling CAS since it's supported on both platforms and all games. It provides a similar uplift.",rx_6000_rdna2

Meanwhile 3070 and 6800 are purely gaming cards for enthisuast and 8GB is perfectly enough or even too much for 1440p gaming in all titles  on highest settings.

Encoding  makes the video quality better and the better the encoding the better the quality if you go to nvidia YouTube channel you will see doom eternal gameplay recorded on rtx 3080 and its pretty good and nvidia said on it's site that the rtx 3080 can be used by YouTubers because of the recording quality and I want to know if the 6800xt has the same features,rx_6000_rdna2

80 bucks more for similar performance.,rx_6000_rdna2
"Kinda.  It's $80 more, though.",rx_6000_rdna2
"It's more expensive, while offering a 2080Ti level of performance. We can rationalise the higher price however we want, but ultimately this won't matter much for those who are aiming to buy a 3070 for two reasons: a) it's amd and b) it breaks the $500 barrier. The rtx 3070 buyers are already price conscious and the 6800 doesn't offer much to them except a higher price.

I guess amd wants to present itself as not-the-budget-gpu-maker, but their previous performance as a gpu maker speaks otherwise. Most people won't bite and will instead wait when the 3070 becomes (more) available.",rx_6000_rdna2
Yes and no. It's not a direct competitor considering it's pricing and perfomance slightly above. Could be that they gonna sandwich the 3070 instead of pushing out a direct competitor. Or that a competitive 6700 xt will release later based on a chip they can't deliver yet. We will see. But probably not before next year.,rx_6000_rdna2
No because we haven't seen any DLSS and RT benchmarks. There must be a reason those weren't shown.,rx_6000_rdna2

"I'm more interested in a good encoder for streaming and RT performance. DLSS is perfectly fine and looks good.

Yeah RAW performance is better but there are so many games coming out with RT and I want to experience them with it, I played through Control with full RT and DLSS and it was just too good.

Those are just my preferences.",rx_6000_rdna2

There will definitely be stock by the time the 6800xt releases. I‚Äôm sure there will be stock in less than two weeks. You think Nvidia would possibly let gamers have no other choice than to buy the 6800xt?,rx_6000_rdna2
Dlss and rtx performance are gimmicks? Lmao you wanna know why they didn‚Äôt show ray tracing performance? Because it gets stomped by the 3080,rx_6000_rdna2
"Ray tracing sure, it's a gimmick and will probably remain one for the forseable future but DLSS has been moving away from being a gimmick and is becoming an actually useful feature that actually gives you more fps.",rx_6000_rdna2
DLSS isn‚Äôt a gimmick when it literally doubles your framerate and improves the image quality,rx_6000_rdna2
What happens when you turn ray tracing on? At 1440p. Compare that to the 3080 with much better native ray tracing AND DLSS,rx_6000_rdna2
"In ray tracing it definitely is, if it wasn‚Äôt AMD would have released the ray tracing numbers. Plus look at the benchmarks that they did release, they‚Äôre all on overclocked cards with ryzen 5000 series CPUs. If you overclock the 3080 and put it on the same CPU it‚Äôll do better.",rx_6000_rdna2
MHW used DLSS 1.0 which was trash. Lots of upcoming AAA games are utilizing DLSS 2.0 and raytracing.,rx_6000_rdna2
"I don't understand why you're being so rude --- he's voicing legitimate concerns. AMD will most likely take the crown in availability and raw memory size, but for $50 more, an RTX 3080 is pretty much guaranteed to give you better drivers, DLSS, along with a suite of other features. However, we still need to wait for benchmarks.

This is coming from someone who is still on a 290x; the 5800x is going to be a close competitor with the 3080. But with all the issues that I've had over the 290x's life and all the problems people have had with the 5700xt, the 3080 is still looking like a great option to me, bar availability.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Implying 80% of the appeal of AMD isn't lowering prices for Nvidia. Look I love their CPUs but ill pay $50 more for driver support, DLSS, and RTX voice",rx_6000_rdna2
"But we don't know how they compare in RT (the 3070 will most likely close the gap quite a bit if not match it or perhaps even outperform it) and AMD doesn't have a DLSS alternative yet. And The performance gap will be smaller in practice, that figure is with the new *smart access memory* tech which most people don't/won't have. 

The price is so close to the XT (which has a great price) that there is no reason to not cough up a bit more and buy that.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Ya but we have no real details or timeline. If Amd was anywhere close to finished surely they'd show off a prototype or give some numbers to attract consumers. Nvidia is a Ai company with massive experience in the field with things like self driving cars and it took them years to develop Dlss 2.0 so i doubt Amd can just show up with a comparable solution any time soon. Who knows how long it will take, could be close to the RDNA 3 release by then. And it may just be comparable to Dlss 1.0 which is significantly inferior to 2.0. I really hope Amd will knock it out of the park though, more competition is better for everyone. It would be amazing if RDNA 3 is superior to Nvidia in every way lile Ryzen is now. Then Nvidia will be smashed out of their complacency and will have no choice but to seriously improve upon their pricing, and behavior in relation to their customers. For me I might just hold on to my 1080 and wait till Rnda 3 if it does come out in a year.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Well that's good to hear. That'll be very interesting, i think most pc gamers are sick of Nvidia not having enough competition, it would be amazing if in a year or two from now Amd's gpu's are superior or matching to Nvidia in almost every way just like Rzyen now. Would really push Nvidia from their complacency and current behavior and pricing. But if it's going to take a while then Ampere might still be a bit better this gen for the time being.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Thats why AMD pushed them into consoles and games are coming out that utilize RT and DLSS. Yeah man, gimmick.",rx_6000_rdna2
People who say this most likely don‚Äôt have a 3000 series card.,rx_6000_rdna2

6800xt has more vram. More is better for 4k gaming,rx_6000_rdna2

There are a lot of applications that run on cuda only (I personally can't find a good free photogrammetry software that supports AMD, all of them use CUDA exclusively, also things like faceapp are a pain to run on AMD) for games, if we can believe AMD, it looks like it depends on the game. For 3D rendering, I'd assume they'll be similar once the amd denoising gets implemented, maybe amd carrs will be a little better since they have more vram.",rx_6000_rdna2

A little bit of both actually. My fiance does a lot of 3D Rendering and I am a bit of an enthusiast. Not to mention the drivers tend to perform better.

"The support doesnt matter as they all use the same DirectX 12 features dont they? Its not about software support for ray tracing, its about whether the raw performance of the cards can handle it",rx_6000_rdna2
"The technology Nvidia uses for DLSS is proprietary to Nvidia. That means that manufactures are going to have to add in a secondary system.  
  
My understanding is they use AI to go thought the game and enhance scenes. Then that AI enhance meant is used in the game. That is the case. Then its not as simple as just slapping it into some software and saying we are good to go.",rx_6000_rdna2
"It has ray tracing but the fact that they didnt really mention it at all or show any clear comparisons makes me think that they arent quite there yet with RT performance seeing as its their first attempt, which is fair

It doesnt have DLSS",rx_6000_rdna2
Super resolution?,rx_6000_rdna2
Ray tracing support doesnt mean it will reach Nvidias RTX cards performance. Nvidia are on their second attempt and their RTX + DLSS combo will absolutely widen the gap between the Nvidia and AMD cards in games that support those. If these new AMD cards had great ray tracing i think they'd have made a bigger deal of it in the show,rx_6000_rdna2
It has its version of DLSS too. But I doubt either of those will be as good as nvidias.,rx_6000_rdna2
"It is just branding but the two companies have taken different approaches to solving the problem, and Nvidia are a gen ahead on their second attempt. Happy to be proven wrong but I'd be quite surprised if the 6800XT came close to the 3080 with ray tracing turned on. If it does, why would they not show that in the presentation?",rx_6000_rdna2
"Yeah agree that VRAM is definitely a positive for AMD, but that becomes more of an issue at 4K rather than 1440p which is where AMDs cards seem to shine the most, so I'm not sure how many games will make the most of that VRAM.

dlss is quite something. imagine in 3 years from now you could just turn on dlss because max details isnt possible anymore and you can play another 3 with that on max details.  its like the magic wand of harry potter. no one beats that :p,rx_6000_rdna2
The 5800 has twice the RAM of the 3070 and the 5800 XT has 60% more RAM than the 3080. They will likely preform at similar levels but that extra RAM is going to give those card a longer life before becoming obsolete with newer games.,rx_6000_rdna2

But, almost.",rx_6000_rdna2
Several big titles before end of this year already have it. Why wouldn't developers include DLSS support when it's so much easier than sitting there optimising. You're getting free juice you'd otherwise have to really hunt for. Especially if you consider the big titles that actually *need* high performance GPUs are produced by teams that will include it. It's just a flat out solid business and development decision.,rx_6000_rdna2

"I did cover that with ""slightly better non RT/DLSS performance"" but it's fair that 10-15% can be seen as more than slightly. Its not gonna be faster with ray tracing though, no way thats why they didn't focus on it. Nvidia is just ahead in that regard especially with DLSS.",rx_6000_rdna2

Then I reinstalled the OS, didn't help. I tried 20.8.3, didn't help, tried 20.4.2 it solved the problem, for 5-6 hours, then lights/reflections started to become too aggressive again. Checked youtube to make sure, videos are broken again.

If drivers truly were faulty, all cards would exhibit similar issues instead of only a portion of them. As far as I know, the biggest suspect in the issues is Freesync in some monitors but I haven't really followed up on it.

What I mean to say is that it would be a mistake for AMD to ""acknowledge"" they had driver issues when not even they can be sure that it was actually true.

I just have reservations about not just raytracing performance but also the absence of a DLSS alternative and most importantly historical VR software support. The 5700XT really couldn't compete with the 2070/s in VR properly because reprojection systems, VRSS, and even stability wasn't up to par. I just hope the inclusion of type-C which is presumably virtuallink means AMD is ready to get serious about VR.",rx_6000_rdna2

Inflation, global market trends, etc. It can't be the same price forever. In 5 years I'm sure the new norm will again be higher.

And the 2080ti was an outlier not because some people foolishly think they wanted to scrape everyone for what they were worth, but rather they had to cover the development cost of RT cores, tensor cores, and AI tech that makes DLSS possible, which were all insanely expensive.

That's just anecdotal, and I'm glad for the people who are able to appreciate the difference and enjoy it.   


That being said, I'm not personally upset with AMD's ray-tracing being abysmal, since I barely even take advantage of RTX let alone DLSS (which I would love to be able to use, but I don't know of a single game I play or am planning on buying that is even implementing DLSS 2.0, which is still graphical wizardry).",rx_6000_rdna2

Nearly none of the actual gsync displays do. There are ""gsync compatible"" once which are just freesync monitors called gsync compatible.

Beginning last November nvidia started to ship out Gsync modules with an updated firmware which do support adaptive sync and gsync/adaptive sync over hdmi. But there are no updates for older monitors and even if you buy a new monitor today you might get one with an old firmware depending on when it was produced/how many old chips the display manufactures still has.

If you want to know if you have a new gsync module which works with amd gpus you may connect your gpu using hdmi. If it shows up as ""gsync compatible"" your monitor does support adaptive sync. If not then it does not.

I can see Xilinx supporting, memory controllers, IO, infinity fabric, and super computer intra chip networking, so you can have say 4+ Epic chips on a daughter board and then connect them all together.

AMD likewise get's new customer's, new channels, and new verticals to get into.  Also, with Xilinx AMD can pursue RISC-V.  I wonder if they will buy a networking company as well, and possibly SiFive.  If they do they could cut NVIDIA off on dominating mobile CPUs / GPUs.

Xilinx would also be baller for PS6, and other next gen consoles as they could fix some CPU architecture bugs at launch or afterwards, or ..... support crazy levels of backwards compatibility by just dynamically uploading old CPU designs to a Xilinx chip.

So my options as of today are to get something low-mid range for just Nvenc and bit of performance increase over my old 390 (like a 1660 Ti/2060) or go for a more lasting purchase with a 3070. For some reason 2060 Super and 2070 Super are insanely high priced atm so they are not even reasonable options.

Plus, you can always get any number of FPS, and it gives you a great picture of the performance.

In 2 generations when developers are using ray tracing for as many lighting effects as possible, you don‚Äôt want the only GPU‚Äôs capable of running the game decently at all to be the newest generation only, you need prior generation support when using new visual technology.

You would get 30% performance increase for 32% cost increase vs the 3070. (barring the value you get from nvidia software)

So many variables unchecked of course such as supply availability, settings consistency, and value of nvenc+dlss+etc, and precision. honestly, dlss might be the thing that makes me consider a 3080 vs 6800xt at this point",rx_6000_rdna2

Intel doesn't need a K chip to be fast enough, while AMD does need an X chip. and the 400f is usually much cheaper than a 3600 non-X anyway. 5600 non-x and 10400f will probably trade blows in pure gaming at the 3070 level. 3080 and 3090 levels will change that up a bit.",rx_6000_rdna2

If I ever feel the need to turn it on again, I'll probably do it, and just not have the motivation to turn it back off until I notice something weird happening or if for some reason a driver update disables it.

3090 is a gaming card with Titan class performance. The 24G memory is there for production tasks. The 3090 is the successor to the 2080 Ti. 3090 is around 10% faster than 3080 in gaming.

Sure, we need to wait for benchmarks on cache - it could be amazing, or it could be problematic - the only way to know is to test.

this means you either don't even know what DLSS is or just chose not to believe it.

When the news came out that 3dfx were in financial trouble, I remember a lot of people jumping to nvidia, because they worried that they would be without driver support. If more people had supported 3dfx at that time, we might have had ATI, 3dfx and nvidia to choose between. Now we are down to two, and somehow people expect the smallest GPU company to be just as advanced and have as many resources as the big GPU company. Yes, AMD still doesn't have the amount of engineers that nvidia and Intel has, but it's a sure way to screw yourself over if you don't support the competitors and think of the bigger picture. I can't believe people have already forgotten how Intel milked consumers just a few years ago. 

Besides of this, nvidia has done a lot of scammy things in the past that makes it hard to support them.

""Why would you ever need 16gb ram...""

The 2080 Ti was highway robbery already, and the 3090 is just shameless beyond belief. The 1080 Ti was a $699 card and the 3090 should be in the same ballpark, if maybe $750 for the beefy cooling system engineering.

It's obviously wise business sense to get  a piece of that juicy pie for yourself as a company, but without Nvidia's shamelessness, AMD couldn't have dared to charge a grand. 

That's just the nature of a duopoly: no need to fix prices, if one side raises theirs, the market prices ain't coming down ever again.

Edit: it's cute how people think the 'discount' was somehow a benevolent move, though. It's what AMD think they can maximally charge with the mindshare they have vs. Nvidia. It's a company, guys, they try to maximize profits.",rx_6000_rdna2

In addition, you are forgetting one important growing gaming sector: VR.  VR is very demanding, and as of DLSS 2.1 VR is supported.  Having DLSS in VR games would drastically help move that sector into full swing.  Not only would more people be able to get into VR and not need the best of the best cards, but it would also allow headset makers to make awesome headsets that were previously unfeasible to use due to the GPU limitation.

AMD is touting ray tracing, but without DLSS, it will run at 30FPS and is therefore essentially useless. 

If you don't see the enormous competitive advantage that DLSS gives going forward, then I don't know what to tell you. The most hyped game of 2020 is Cyperpunk and the 6900XT is not going to run that at 4k@60FPS with ray tracing on, while the 3080 will easily do it with DLSS.",rx_6000_rdna2

"Here's my thought process:

The consoles are both using a Ryzen-derivative CPU and RDNA 2-derivative GPU. In short, consider them both using an 8c/16t CPU with an RDNA 2-based GPU approximately around a ""6700 XT"" (roughly 40 CUs.)

If you are going to build a new PC for gaming and want it to last, say, 5 years with good performance matching and/or exceeding the consoles, then you should match the console's raw hardware performance, if possible. You do not want to have fewer cores (or threads), nor a weaker GPU, because the consoles will have some optimizations that a PC will not have access to.

Thus, at minimum, I recommend you look at 8c/16t Ryzen 5000 series, paired with a 500-series board (so you can enable SAM.) Hypothetically, a 6700-series GPU (coming next year) will put you right around console-level quality.

"All of those games are shit except for Cyberpunk 2077. Did you actually play the COD:Cold War beta on PC? Looked like shit, ran like shit.. didn't matter if you had a graphics card capable enough to run it well. RTX can't make a shitty game look good.

Early game play of Valhalla was the same way. Ran well, but looked like shit even with the graphics tuned up. I guess you could make an argument for Watch Dogs but I haven't personally played it any early releases of it or seen any benchmarks on it so maybe your computer will benefit from having RTX?

For the record, I currently have a 3080 and I know for a fact RTX is a gimmick right now that I'm 100% going to be turning off when its not needed. I had a 2080ti before this 3080 and never really used the RTX features then, and I doubt this will change with any new games in the next 1 -2 years. By the time RTX is standard and makes an impactful difference on graphics of video games people like myself will be upgrading to more powerful gpus anyway.

So in conclusion, no RTX is not really a selling point of CURRENT gen Nvidia cards and this is specifically why AMD didn't waste their time on Ray tracing.

Considerations of value are entirely personal, so it's up to you to decide if paying 250 more makes sense for your usage.

"I assume you're talking about the thread where someone was talking about their 2600x. CPU and GPU have to communicate very well for workloads such as gaming. At 1080p the graphical demands of the workload are much lower than say 1440p or 4K resolution, and as a result the GPU is able to clear its workload and end up having to wait on the CPU to process elements and communicate to the GPU, meaning the CPU acts as the performance bottleneck. At higher resolutions this becomes less of an issue as the GPU is more heavily loaded while the workload on the CPU is not greatly changed, so the CPU is not as much of a limiting factor. Older ryzen CPUs didn't necessarily excel in those workloads, and would end up as a limiting factor paired with these cards at lower resolutions as a result. Hope that helps",rx_6000_rdna2

"Hi Blake. I am! If you wanna do gaming on Linux, I suggest the following after modern engineering has simplified the process:

1. Getting a second ssd.
2. Installing pop\_os! for your GPU flavor on that SSD
3. Installing Steam, proton, etc. 
4. Playing your games since they almost all will run natively! (minus those that use special anti-cheat also known as spyware)

Pop\_os! has the most advanced GPU tools of any operating system, and you will be able to update all of your software that you need to handle gaming like this, within the app store by pressing the update button.

If the AMD cards still have a decent amount of room for tweaking, then they're going to be the overclockers choice this time around, and - trying to put my hype aside - could even end up pulling slightly ahead of their NVIDIA counterparts when they're both manual OCd.",rx_6000_rdna2

"The goal of raytracing isn't to make games prettier. It's so developers don't have to make 10 layers on everything to get it pretty.  
The result is that much less time has to be spend getting it pretty. The difference in prettiness depends on how much effort was put in with the old way. RT mainly being used by AAA games, that difference is little today because they started out with beefed graphics.  

For big developers it means they can fire people and tell their shareholders how much more money they're making. For indies it's a breakthrough in saving time on learning and implementation for the developers and major graphic updates for their players.  
But only once there is market saturation of RT hardware is it possible. For the time being the old way has to be implemented. Learning and adding RT on top doesn't make financial sense yet.

"I get that $80 is a premium, but my point is that it's a ~16% increase in price for what is purportedly a similar increase in performance and double the memory. If you're value conscious then they seem to both have a case - and simultaneously these are $500+ cards we're talking about so I don't think we can argue much about $80 being a lot of money since both products are expensive to begin with.

I mean, hell, I game at 1440p and I'd be concerned about buying a pricey GPU with just 8GB of G6 since some games are already using up that much before the new consoles even release...

I'd also argue that there's a considerable amount of people out there who aren't bothered about ray tracing - I'd personally count myself among them as from my perspective I think it's failed to deliver a step change in graphical quality despite the huge performance hit. 

But - and this is important - I think it just comes down to the individual. I think you can make the case for both of these cards at their relative price points, and I don't think it's so simple as 'A product beats B product' - I think they're fundamentally different value propositions. If you want to game at 4K the 6800 might take it, if you desperately want ray tracing then maybe the 3070 takes it, etc. To my eyes these two cards are essentially in two different brackets entirely.

You've completely ignored that the 6900 xt exists to match the 3090. So i'll dumb down the quesetion for you.

ahem

If the 6900xt exists to match the 3090, why would AMD allow the 6800xt to match the 6900xt in performance? Ergo, why would they let you buy essentially a gpu for $650 with equivalent performance to the 6900xt, while also selling the 6900xt for $1000?

In other words, if 6900xt=3090, and you claim 6800xt=3090, then you're claiming 6800xt=6900xt, and equivalently $650=$1000.

First of all, wow, what the fuck. $150 over MSRP? Sounds like a rip off for an AIB card, why didn't you go for the much cheaper FE? I would guess availability, but even then... waiting sounds like the more reasonable choice over that price hike.

But... you would have to sell it. The MSRP no longer quite applies, right? Or are you counting on the limited availability making it so your purchase didn't lose any value from your use?

Regardless, the 6800XT wouldn't offer a lot of more performance, if any, over it.

DLSS might not be available for whichever game you currently play, but it definitely is available in a modest list of over 20 of the latest games, and support will very likely increase each passing month with new realeases.

Keep in mind that the raytracing is supported in all the consoles and such already.. and on mac.. So devs should have an easy time of getting their programs out.. i suspect nvidia will eventually be more of an outlier then a standard going fwd.

AMD using more open standards will hopefully win out over nvida cuda/rtx eventually.. giving the industry a better playing field and the customers more choice.,rx_6000_rdna2

For example, OP could be working on their PC while their significant other games on the console, something that wouldn't be possible with the acquisition of just a new GPU.

"100%.  Though I guess we'll see if the tin-hat people are right, and Nvidia's been holding back supply until AMD laid out its RDNA2 hand.

A non-fanboi position might well be ""well, even AMD says that the 6800XT trades blows with the 3080... and that's with Zen 3 on a 500-series board.  I can get a 3080 today for $699, but who knows what the supply will be like for a 6800XT when it comes out.""

Frankly, I think AMD's shooting itself in the foot by not showing performance numbers with smart access memory and ""rage mode"" turned off, because for anyone who isn't planning on upgrading their CPU any time soon (or who wasn't planning to get a 500-series mobo), we really have no idea how RDNA2 will perform for us.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Right. There's 2 theories I've got here:

1) Both AMD and Nvidia did a great job with pricing since they REALLY push you towards their high-end (non-halo, they know most of us won't spend $1k or $1500) cards: I think a lot of people who bought say, a 1070 and are looking to upgrade might now convince themselves that the 3080 is a better deal (than the 3070): ""Only"" $200 more gets you more RAM and considerably more bandwidth, a significantly faster processor overall.  Ditto with AMD - if the numbers they showed are remotely accurate, stepping up to the 6800XT from the 6800 is a no-brain $70 to spend.

2) AMD's got a trick up its sleeve with 6800 pricing.  Not sure if it'll just be a Black Friday deal or something like what they did with RDNA1, but as it stands, the 6800(non-XT) doesn't look like that smart of a purchase, and AMD probably knew that, because they've known the 3070 pricing for months, and Nvidia always stated that the 3070 had ""2080 Ti performance,"" which turned out to be true (AMD's slide deck even used the 2080 Ti since they didn't have 3070 numbers when putting it together).  

Now, I think AMD is somewhat limited in how much of a discount they can offer, b/c 16GB of GDDR6 ain't cheap, but I guess we'll see, but AMD clearly was looking at all the same numbers we saw today for a while, and had to have realized how the 6800 looks in the stack.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Trying to read into a crystal ball is probably a mistake. 4 years ago, Ryzen hadn't launched yet and we were on universally 2-to-4-thread AAA titles. 

I would be more charitable towards it if AMD hadn't already leaked a competing upscaling tech, *and* there's already something out there with much better compatibility.

Image sharpening upscaling works just fine and is backwards-compatible, which will be relevant for high-refresh or 4k gaming in the mid-range for the next generation or two. As of right now, it's still relevant on the high-end to prevent framerate dips, even without RTX.

[Edit] Put another way, I just want a card that I can play Fallout 4 on at 4k, and I'm in the majority here. I may be wrong, but my math says there are more people using RTX cards than playing DLSS games.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Right, and you can just use image sharpening upscaling with an 80% render scale to get 50-70% of the uplift, or at 60% render scale to get an even better uplift with a hit to quality. 

It's completely independent of game, or even AMD/Nvidia hardware, so you don't have to worry about predicting your interest in future games or how long you're going to be keeping the card. I already use it in Fallout 4 when piling on the visual fidelity mods.

Focusing on DLSS just seems like a very bad idea to me, when at least right now there's a better and more certain option that makes it irrelevant to most people.

Even then, I still included some diminishing returns in my calculations.

It kinda feels like you're overpaying about $100-150 for a future-proof amount of VRAM, which is probably not even relevant if you buy this for sub-4K gaming. As you've just mentioned, DLSS is a really big deal, capable of basically turning 3070 into a 3080 in games that support it, and actually allowing you to be perfectly fine with having less VRAM (because you always upscale from sub-4K with DLSS). 6800 just doesn't make any sense to me.",rx_6000_rdna2

">You're confused. So according to you....it's both a Titan....and a 2080 Ti successor? Lol pick one dude. Or call 911 because it seems like you're stroking out.

3090 has 24G memory just like the Titan. Nvidia basically merged the two together, except 3090 doesn‚Äôt have Titan drivers. Nvidia is charging $1500 for it because it was the fastest card and only the fastest one with that much VRAM. It‚Äôs a 2080 Ti successor with Titan specs. It wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt possible for nvidia to go any higher. Also childish insults really shows who a person really is.

>You've completely ignored that the 6900 xt exists to match the 3090. So i'll dumb down the quesetion for you.

I know that. I‚Äôm saying 6800 XT / 3080 can be overclocked to match it. 


>If the 6900xt exists to match the 3090, why would AMD allow the 6800xt to match the 6900xt in performance? Ergo, why would they let you buy essentially a gpu for $650 with equivalent performance to the 6900xt, while also selling the 6900xt for $1000?

Why would nvidia allow the 3080 to match the 3090? That‚Äôs a question you gotta ask them, not me.

>In other words, if 6900xt=3090, and you claim 6800xt=3090, then you're claiming 6800xt=6900xt, and equivalently $650=$1000.

No i claimed 6800 XT + aib + oc = 3090. 6900 XT is the binned full die 6800 XT version. Those 6900 XTs that have a few dead cores are binned into the 6800 XT pile. It‚Äôs an 8 compute unit difference.

The feature is coming eventually in a driver update to compete with DLSS. It will be discussed during the upcoming architecture deep-dive.

">First of all, wow, what the fuck. $150 over MSRP? Sounds like a rip off for an AIB card, why didn't you go for the much cheaper FE? I would guess availability, but even then... waiting sounds like the more reasonable choice over that price hike.

>But... you would have to sell it. The MSRP no longer quite applies, right? Or are you counting on the limited availability making it so your purchase didn't lose any value from your use?

Because I can buy it lol? I need to upgrade from my 5700 xt in one way or another, and I can easily sell this card for exactly what I paid for it. The card maxes at 65 deg and is a champ for what I need it for. Also lose value? I've used it for under a month, it's not a car where it depreciates immediately when I drive it off the lot, it's not beaten or any damage in anyway to it or the packaging.

>Regardless, the 6800XT wouldn't offer a lot of more performance, if any, over it.

Yeah..? I never said it would, the 6900 xt would. I said I would either be saving money or gaining performance for an equivalent price increase.

>DLSS might not be available for whichever game you currently play, but it definitely is available in a modest list of over 20 of the latest games, and support will very likely increase each passing month with new realeases. As a technology, it is nothing short of a marvel: it increases performance while not affecting or even increasing visual fidelity. It's definitely a feature that is worth having, regardless of whether you will use it right away or not.

By the time 4k144hz monitors are affordable, GPUs are going to be able to handle it, regardless of brand. 20 latest games? A few major titles and a bunch of indie games aren't that impressive, regardless, I don't need to use it and don't want to. There are 2-3 games that are using it within the next few months of releases that I would consider it but a 3080 will do fine without it in terms of 1440p. AMD is going to have their own version as well, it's not the end of the world, even ray tracing is barely used and unimpressive in the vast majority of implementations. If it becomes something that's actually impressive in terms of difference, I'll just buy a new card?",rx_6000_rdna2
"That is a fair point and I just accepted that as well. Although I'm not sure how much it really matters. People who buy high-end cards won't really go for a budget option, because it won't have the performance. People who buy budget cards don't have the budget to afford high-end cards(as well as a monitor+CPU to give any reason to own a high-end card).

There's also an interesting contrast between CPU and GPU announcements that AMD had made. With CPUs, they've announced models on the higher end, but also 5600X, which I would consider a mainstream offering. Meanwhile, with GPUs, they've essentially announced only their enthusiast cards. Even a high-end option like 6700 wasn't mentioned, let alone a more mainstream card(like a potential 6600).",rx_6000_rdna2
"Just because there might be something better coming out later does not means that the 3090 should not be treated like a content creation card and not a gaming card.

The VRAM on the 3080 is not gimped, they chose to go with faster GDDR6X instead of having more VRAM, we have to wait and see how it performs in comparison. Which one was the best option? Fanboys on both sides will tell you different things. 320W Vs 300W is not that big of a difference considering the VRAM difference too, and the cards trade blows in rasterization, still no word on RT.

">Sure that‚Äôs fair.  I think the 3090 will peak at well over 400 watts with the power limit cranked up.  I wonder how the performance would look if the 6900 could use 400+ watts.

Most people are not interested in how much watt the gpu draws and only care how many fps they get. And if you do care about that than you should definitely not be using rage mode and rather lower the power target even more. 

And for all we know the 6900 could use 400 Watts if rage mode is activated. AMD only published the stock power limit is 300 Watt, but there are cards out there which allow you to crank the power limit up to 140% over the stock limit. If that is the case with the 5900XT it would draw up to 420 watts. But as we do not know the power target of rage mode it might also might only be 330 watt.

But the point still stands having one card running at stock while having the other one at a higher than default set powerlimit is simply unfair and  misleading. Either set both to the same watt usage, by either decreasing or increasing the power target of one of them, have both run at stock or max out the power target on both cards.",rx_6000_rdna2

"The big thing that skews the argument is how close the 6800 is in price to the 6800xt. Only 70 dollars seperates them, it's a less than 15 percent price increase, and the performance gap is almost certainly higher than that. (My bet its 15-20 percent.)

Even with the 3070 vs 3080 that 40 percent price increase for the 3080 very nearly makes up that performance difference between the cards, especially at 4k where I wouldn't even consider a 3070 with it's 8gb vram.

The 6800 then enters this weird 3070ti spot, where it's viable for 4k for it's vram, and it's likely more realistic 10-15 percent lead over the 3070.
But being just 80 usd cheaper I don't see why not to go with the higher end card unless you're really squeezing the budget.

All of those tricks and features only resulted in 10-15% performance lead in SOME games compared to a 2 year old GPU that uses 12% more power.

Well that's the thing, usually the more expensive AIB models, the ones that deviate the most from MSRP, are the one that depreciate more, proportionally, but it's all good, it was just curiosity.

>Also lose value? I've used it for under a month, it's not a car where it depreciates immediately when I drive it off the lot, it's not beaten or any damage in anyway to it or the packaging.

When availability isn't an issue, it 100% depreciates as soon as you are talking second hand market. Of course, the more you use it the more it depreciates, but there is always a difference between first hand and second hand market. People always prefer to buy new if availability isn't an issue and the price isn't significantly different.

>Yeah..? I never said it would, the 6900 xt would. I said I would either be saving money or gaining performance for an equivalent price increase.

Sure, you said you were thinking of buying either the 6800XT or 6800XT previously. That's why I mentioned the 6800XT. Assuming a 3080 that costs $700, the \~15% performance increase a 6900XT would provide for $999 would definitely not be very much worth the \~42% price increase. That's what I meant with terrible idea, in either case you are deviating from price/performance significantly.

There are 2-3 games that are using it within the next few months of releases that I would consider it but a 3080 will do fine without it in terms of 1440p.

"By the time more VRAM matters there would already be a 3070 Super or something. Yeah sure 15% is a lot better but keep in mind that the benchmarks were using smart access memory and the 3070 is faster than the 2080 ti which the 6800 was compared to. In reality, it's gonna be less than a 5% difference at 4k for like $80 more than the 3070. Better to just get the 6800 XT as that's better than the 3080 but costs $50 less, the benchmarks also showed that it outperformed the 3080 without smart access or rage mode all with a lower power draw.",rx_6000_rdna2

"Definitely.  There's a ton of pent up demand since you could realistically have had say, a RX 480 or like, even a 980 or something, and been sitting on the fence because though there were performance improvements you could buy, they weren't cheap.  These new cards will get a lot of people to pay for one of the current gen of cards.

I think its *really* telling that, by far (IMHO), the most compelling card AMD released today was the 6800XT, which really does compete at the high end for a smidge less money (the 6900XT and 3090.... exist but I mean, how many of us are *really* going to spend $1k+ on a graphics card?).  The last time that AMD released a card that was performance AND feature-comparable (sorry, Radeon VII) to Nvidia's 80-series was what, the R9 Fury X? And even then it frequently fell behind while also using a lot more power.

AMD's really aiming for the high end here - though I also wouldn't be terribly surprised if AMD didn't have a trick up its sleeve for the 6800 (non-XT) pricing, either like what they did with the RDNA1 cards or as part of a Black Friday deal or something.",rx_6000_rdna2
"Real-time ray tracing is the path forward, everyone agrees on that. However, it is equally easy to argue for it as against. 

For example, ray tracing is insanely computationally expensive, and is only ever more so as we push higher and higher resolutions. Jumping from 1080p to 1440p and then to 4K is already adding a big load on GPUs; ray tracing only exacerbates that. Essentially, enabling ray tracing halves performance. It is a huge performance hit, I think you'd agree.

And for that hit, we are (generally) getting ray tracing effects in certain areas; for example, ray traced environmental lighting, but not effects, like muzzle fire. There's a trade-off in what lighting options can be used, because of a severe performance penalty.

Further still, the computational cost is so high, that at best we can cast 1-2 rays per pixel, which is an enormously far cry from ""realistic"" rendering, which (theoretically) says we need to cast \~500 rays per pixel to simulate.

So, we're trying to move things forward, but we're struggling to do so because the performance hit is severe, and casting an abysmal amount of rays ends up in a massively noisy image, which then requires further effort to denoise‚Äîand to make performance not awful, supersampling to upscale.

Honestly, I think ray tracing is premature. It is the way forward, I completely agree, but the amount of rays we can cast, and the limitations of types of lighting it can apply to, at the cost it incurs at current resolutions and the remedies of such (denoising, upsampling) to fix, are huge.

Unfortunately, the cat is out of the bag now, and there is no going back.

I think AMD's approach to hybridization of BVH traversal makes sense. Push traditional rasterization, support RT and leverage CUs to enable it without dedicating huge portions of the die to do so, and leverage effects where the tradeoff in performance makes sense visually.",rx_6000_rdna2

"I'm not sure if you're referring to me when saying people are delusional or  neandetholic \[sic\]?  I was responding to a comment that seemingly disregarded the amount of VRAM entirely, saying that both the 3070 and the 6800 are faster than the 2080TI, but 3070 is $70 (thus suggesting it's the better option).

And while I agree that 8gb is sufficient in most cases today, it *might* not be in the future, especially considering that both of the next gen consoles have 16gb of vram, and thus, new games *might* take advantage of that extra memory in the not-so-distant future.

So the question is, if everything else is the same, is 8gb of extra VRAM worth $70? I think so, but that's just my guess. But of course, there's also other factors to consider, like ray tracing performance, DLSS, drivers and software, and so on.

"Like a higher performance to be able to use the high refresh rates of all the modern monitors? I don't understand why everyone talks so bad about the price of the 6800.

It's 580 compared to 500 which is 16% more expensive whereas bf5 as an example from the shown performance metrics is a difference of around 140 to 184 in 1440p which is a difference of 30%
It's not every game which has such an increase but nethertheless it's slightly higher.
I think the first real tests will show which card has the best price/performance ratio and the pricing of 580 let's enough room for a 5700xt replacement which will compete with the 3070 for maybe a lower price.

"It is looking like 6800 is a better buy though but it depends entirely on what you want from the card. DLSS and their current RT support is growing a lot and makes a good selling feature.

Without proper benchmarks yet though it's impossible to say but at the moment the 6800 looks like better price for raw performance. But only since GPU's or any PC parts don't linearly scale when increasing costs. The higher end gear is always more expensive compared to the actual performance difference. It's the price for getting the most cutting edge, no expenses barred tech. So when you have a card that is in a higher category that is pushing as much if not more price/perf then it's a relatively good deal.

Again though, there are much more to these cards than just raw performance. Whether someone wants early/better RT support or DLSS vs whether they want to use AMD cpu to maximize their raw gaming performance.",rx_6000_rdna2

"It doesn't skew the argument, it's just a different argument ;)

It does kinda look like this is what it is really, like those entry-level iPhones having so little storage that they basically exist just to raise the price of the actually usable models. A rather disgusting practice.

This doesn't do anything to the argument that buying 6800 just doesn't make sense. Unless you are falling into a trap of arguing against yourself and taking the side of a corporation instead of us the consumers in an attempt to make sense out of this.

I kinda doubt 6800 even does +15% at rasterisation over 3070. It appears to be quite a bit worse than that. In their own slides they actually had to cheat and give 6800 a Smart Access Memory boost only available on the latest Ryzen so that it doesn't lose to 2080Ti (\~3070) in Division 2 and Wolfenstein. So I'd expect it to be something more like -5% to +20% against 3070, averaging at +8% when the comparison is actually fair.

If it were to cost $500, then it would be a potential 3070 alternative for those who want 4K for $500, don't care much about raytracing, don't want to depend on DLSS support, and don't care about better drivers with better tech like Reflex low-latency, GSYNC etc... Even then, 3070 would still give you better 4K performance with DLSS and probably just plain destroy 6800 when both DLSS and raytracing are on such as in Cyberpunk. Add to that the fact that AMD's drivers are also kinda second-rate on reliability and I'd say that even at $500 both, 3070 would be a better buy. $570 makes no sense.

Now, the real disappointing part to me is that 6800XT, while certainly more sensible, is still priced way too high for what it offers. It trades blows in certain scenarios with 3080 while being $50 cheaper. Great. So  does that $50 discount really worth giving up DLSS, better raytracing, better drivers and everything that comes with that? Personally, I think that DLSS alone is worth more than $50.

Honestly, the only way these prices make sense to me is if AMD is betting hard on NVIDIA continuing to have no supply to speak of for months. Because while that is the case and you can't really buy an Ampere card for less than $1000, that certainly makes $650 6800XT a lot more attractive and the holiday season is just around the corner.

I mean I gave you an argument that I was upgrading anyway, to a better card regardless of brand. My argument is I can afford it regardless, it's simply a decision I have to make, sorry my reasoning isn't what you want it to be? I got this first and can easily make my money back if I want an AMD card. Also I really don't believe you saying that they depreciate more unless you have actual stats on used listings. Supply is extremely low and I could more than likely sell it for over what I originally paid.

>When availability isn't an issue, it 100% depreciates as soon as you are talking second hand market. Of course, the more you use it the more it depreciates, but there is always a difference between first hand and second hand market.

And stock issues are extending into 2021 for nvidia, I think I'm fine. The more you use isn't really an argument unless it's 1+ year of use and cleaned, unless you're mining or destroying the card or it has tons of caked dust/dander in it.

>Sure, you said you were thinking of buying either the 6800XT or 6800XT previously. That's why I mentioned the 6800XT. Assuming a 3080 that costs $700, the ~15% performance increase a 6900XT would provide for $999 would definitely not be very much worth the ~42% price increase. That's what I meant with terrible idea, in either case you are deviating from price/performance significantly.

A 3080 costs $850 because that's what I paid for it? From $850 -> $999, it's a 16% price increase for 15% perf increase. Use the actual data I would if you want to make an argument about it.

>There are quite affordable 144Hz 4K monitors already, like the roughly $800 ROG Strix XG27UQ. It costs less than your GPU! If you don't already have a 4K high refresh rate monitor... isn't a 3080, 6800XT or 6900XT already quite the overkill?

Except I have a 1440p 144hz monitor and a 1080p 144hz monitor, I'm fine where I'm at. Like I said, I'm not going to be paying that much when 4k 144hz is going to improve much more over the next few years and become even more affordable. Also did you even try to look for that monitor?

"It was implemented at the beginning, again, to very very few games. It remains to be seen what AMD's implementation is like.

">For example, ray tracing is insanely computationally expensive, and is only ever more so as we push higher and higher resolutions. Jumping from 1080p to 1440p and then to 4K is already adding a big load on GPUs; ray tracing only exacerbates that. Essentially, enabling ray tracing halves performance. It is a huge performance hit, I think you'd agree.

1. Which is exactly why DLSS is important. It negates the ""halving"" of Ray-Tracing. 
2. I guarantee you if devs could move away COMPLETELY from fake-baking lighting with cube-maps, and ONLY use RTX. They would, but they know that this is still a long ways away unfortunately. So yes it is more computationally expensive, but it is also FAR easier for devs to implement as it is all physics based and works out of the box without the hundreds of hours to make cube-maps. 

> And for that hit, we are (generally) getting ray tracing effects in certain areas; for example, ray traced environmental lighting, but not effects, like muzzle fire. There's a trade-off in what lighting options can be used, because of a severe performance penalty.

Yep, the absolute best implementation is control so far. We'll see how good Cyberpunks implementation is. Albeit I would bet extremely good given their very close partnership with Nvidia on said implementation. 

> Further still, the computational cost is so high, that at best we can cast 1-2 rays per pixel, which is an enormously far cry from ""realistic"" rendering, which (theoretically) says we need to cast \~500 rays per pixel to simulate.

Which is true, but even with the 1-2 rays per pixel. It is still extremely obvious that ray-tracing is active in games where it is implemented properly. See: Metro Exodus (global illumination) and Control (everything). 

Thus regardless of if its not ""full"" ray-tracing. There are still several visual benefits that are well worth it, imo. 

 

>So, we're trying to move things forward, but we're struggling to do so because the performance hit is severe, and casting an abysmal amount of rays ends up in a massively noisy image, which then requires further effort to denoise‚Äîand to make performance not awful, supersampling to upscale.

True. 

 

>Honestly, I think ray tracing is premature. It is the way forward, I completely agree, but the amount of rays we can cast, and the limitations of types of lighting it can apply to, at the cost it incurs at current resolutions and the remedies of such (denoising, upsampling) to fix, are huge.

Meh, I don't think it's premature. I mean, not anymore so than any other time. The 1st variation, or hell, the first COUPLE of variations of any new tech is always going to seem ""premature"" whenever new issues arise with it. It won't ever pass out of said ""premature"" phase if it is never developed however. Technology needs to continue to advance. 

> I think AMD's approach to hybridization of BVH traversal makes sense. Push traditional rasterization, support RT and leverage CUs to enable it without dedicating huge portions of the die to do so, and leverage effects where the tradeoff in performance makes sense visually.

Sure I agree that this will probably be the way forward within the next decade, but for now. Nvidia seems to have it down correctly. From igorslab leaks, whose raster benchmarks matched what was shown in the presentation. RT performance is worse on AMD. AMD also just said they are ""working"" on a DLSS equivalent with no actual demo even shown. 

Thus for now, it seems like having them on separate parts of the die to be hardware accelerated individually, is still the way to go.",rx_6000_rdna2

"That is definitely fair enough, I may have misread what you were trying to say.

That said, I have a few things I'd like to point out.

1. I think the thrust of the original point is that pushing a power supply closer to 100% uses up more power, so if you're trying to be efficient, you shouldn't be aiming to max out your PSU all the time. E.g., if you can run your PSU at 20% load, then run it at 20% load. The way you worded your point made it sound like you were trying to say that that wasn't true--that you should be trying to run near 50% load (or whatever the max efficiency is at). That's simply not the case. If you have a 1000W PSU and you need 200W, @85% efficiency (aka any bronze rated PSU) you'll be using up ~240W (rounded up). But if you run at 50% load you're still going to be using 500@, over twice as much power, even if the PSU were magically 100% efficient. I think this might be the same line of mathematical reasoning that makes people rage at progressive income taxes, haha.

2. I couldn't actually find any manufacturer datasheets like yours for cheaper PSUs (my guess is the manufacturers don't care as much :p), but the minimum to get certified for bronze/silver/gold rating can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus#Efficiency_level_certifications) on Wikipedia. Assuming OP was discussing actual rated PSUs (which I think is a fair assumption), you can see that the efficiency across the board varies by no more than 2~4%. While this is a minimum and manufacturers are certainly free to make more efficient PSUs (e.g. a silver-rated PSU that is 99% efficient at 50% load), I think the datasheet you linked shows that a ~3% variation is pretty typical. This covers the vast majority of the PSU market, not just the ""top class PSUs"" like you seem to be implying.

3. To expand on my original point, I think I actually have a stronger case than I stated at first--if we're taking an 750W PSU (for example), a 3% difference isn't even 22.5W--the efficiency is calculated *at* the voltage in question, which means at 50% efficiency, we need to multiple 375W by 3%, which is a measly ~12W. If you look at a graph of net power consumed vs load%, the function will be strictly (monotonically) *increasing*, although the slope will change at different points (but always be positive). You will never use less power by running at a higher load%.

Anyway, thank you for pointing out that strictly speaking, efficiency does decrease at higher load%. That doesn't necessarily mean what most people think it means, but as someone with a bit of background in EE, it's a good thing you corrected me.

However, you do come off as extremely hostile and combative--which you're free to do!--but probably doesn't get you anywhere in life compared to just being nice to people. I'm typing this because I have nothing better to do, but that's not true of most people.

You bought exceptionally out of MSRP. Your purchase was at a price much, much higher than what the card can be get at from Nvidia itself. Of course, when you buy at such bad prices, when a new offer comes about, it is likely that, assuming you can sell at a similar price to the one you bought at, it will be a good idea to do it.

And the performance from ti to non ti was around 10% and from ti to 1080 also around 10%. And the 1070ti was a highly appreciated gpu afaik. Dunno if you need Smth in the gap between a 3070 and 3080/6800xt but amd also did not know until some weeks ago how well Nvidia GPUs perform. Maybe they thought there will be Smth compared to the 6800.

Of course, when you buy at such bad prices, when a new offer comes about, it is likely that, assuming you can sell at a similar price to the one you bought at, it will be a good idea to do it.

Except Aorus 3080 MSRP is $850, I have never once said anything about FE cards or flat $700 msrp cards. You are the only one suggesting that it should be in relation to a lower priced card when it means nothing to my situation, my decision is based around the $850 price point of the card I currently own.

>When I said it sounded like a terrible idea I referred to the known MSRP values, not your particular case.

Go look over at r/hardwareswap and find me someone selling 3080s at a loss, you're arguing entirely in bad faith at this point. I never cared that I paid $150 over the base $700 msrp in the first place, again, my decision entirely stems from the $850 price point.

After you clarified that, I simply said that even then, you wouldn't get more performance from a 6800XT (obviously, the 6900XT would be more expensive anyway). I didn't imply it was a terrible idea, nor did I say it, I simply implied it didn't look like it was worth the trouble.

You sure about that? Or do you have short term memory loss? Because you're using $700 as the price point in why it would be a terrible idea.

>Sure, you said you were thinking of buying either the 6800XT or 6800XT previously. That's why I mentioned the 6800XT. Assuming a 3080 that costs $700, the ~15% performance increase a 6900XT would provide for $999 would definitely not be very much worth the ~42% price increase. That's what I meant with terrible idea, in either case you are deviating from price/performance significantly.

Why would you care about hardwareswap prices? Because it's the USED MARKET.. where the hell else are you going to get pricing for used 3080s from? Like are you trolling at this point?

Considering I've quoted multiple lies in this comment alone, yeah, you have. You keep pretending that I think it was a 'bad deal' to spend what I did on a 3080 when in reality, that's not even close to true. You've been continually arguing it's a bad idea literally this entire comment chain. MSRP does not apply to every single product that is produced from the base item. It's not going to hold true unless the pricing stays the same throughout it, AGAIN why you shouldn't have continued to use $700 throughout your examples.
