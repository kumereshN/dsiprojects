According to news from the Taiwan board manufacturer, NVIDIA has confirmed that it will launch the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti in January. The price is estimated to be US$999 against AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. The GPU specifications are very close to the GeForce RTX 3090, but the memory is frequent. The bandwidth will be reduced from 384bit to 320bit, and the memory capacity will be reduced from 24GB to 20GB GDDR6X. NVIDIA is waiting to see that AMD’s new card cannot be ignored.

 

According to the information obtained, NVIDIA is planning to launch the ""GeForce RTX 3080 Ti"", which will be positioned between RTX 3090 and RTX 3080. It will use GA102-250-KD-A1 graphics core, PG133-SKU15 PCB design, and built-in The same 10496 CUDA Cores as RTX 3090, but the memory configuration is reduced to 20GB GDDR6X VRAM, 320-bit memory interface. RTX 3080 Ti will have the same TGP as RTX 3080, which is controlled at the level of 320W, and also does not support NVLink.

 

In terms of price, the Taiwan board manufacturer stated that the RTX 3080 Ti is estimated to be priced at USD 999. It has to be said that the price-performance ratio of the ""GeForce RTX 3080 Ti"" is much more attractive than that of the GeForce RTX 3090 at the asking price of US$1,499, which makes AMD Radeon more attractive. The price and memory capacity advantages of the RX 6900 XT have completely disappeared.",rtx_3080ti_priced

"I'm honestly kinda pissed with Nvidia. 

I have a 3080, so maybe I don't have a ""right"" to be mad, but how/why the hell are they talking about future SKUs and future cards and AMD competition when YOU HAVE NO STOCK OF CURRENT ITEMS. 

I get it, I get it, some would say it's the ""same chip, better binned"" or something to that effect, but come on. 

you have millions of customers waiting for 3080s, or even 3070s, and you priced the cards almost predatorily to lure everyone in, and then you can't deliver. 

even in THESE comments, you've created a world of disbelief because quite frankly nobody cares about the 3080ti, 3070ti, or whatever other announcement you have in mind until you can deliver the bare minimum you promised 2 months ago.",rtx_3080ti_priced

"Nvidia has lost their marbles. There is not one positive comment about this card on the internet, and even if the 3070/3080/3090 weren't so hard to find, this would still be very pointless. This not necessary to compete with AMD's offerings and is essentially Nvidia competing with itself, as they did repeatedly over the last two years already.

This absolutely will take away capacity to make other cards, which Nvidia already seems to be struggling with.

I personally felt Nvidia should have held off and launched the 3xxx very late this year or early next year as it is, they clearly launched it too soon. And the ""we didn't anticipate the demand"" thing is a crock of shit.

I'm waiting for them to release a 3090ti in February now just to piss off the 3090 owners. And then in March release Super versions of everything. Then release some 2660 cards also in ti and super variants in April.

Pare the damn skus down, make sure the yield is high enough to actually sell the fucking things, and then put them to market. Nvidia is turning into Intel, they are so bloated and arrogant that they are making rookie, amateur mistakes and basically begging AMD to step in and be the ""good guy"" again and sweep a huge chunk of their market away from them. Nvidia's market position is way more fragile than they believe it to be and they just don't care.

Seriously, this is ***mind bogglingly stupid to release in January.*** The existence of this in like, a year, maybe next fall, could possibly make sense. But right now this is just *stupid*.",rtx_3080ti_priced

"I think a lot of people are missing the benefits that the extra VRAM has when it comes to VR supersampling.

I've been tinkering between a 2080 Ti we've spent a few hundreds hours with on a Valve Index and was running into a wall of reprojection at times even at 100% resolution scaling. I'd have to lower some of the graphic settings on a game by game basis in order to ensure a consistent 120 FPS and 0% reprojection which obviously looks slightly worse but feels better.

After bumping up to the 3090 and utilizing fpsVR to monitor realtime performance statistics, it's clear that the 3090 is an absolute monster of a VR card. I've been able to supersample multiple games to 200-300% resolution scaling, maintain 120 FPS, and have 0% reprojection all thanks to the extra bandwidth and increased VRAM. Games like Onward was utilizing 21GB of VRAM while supersampled and had no issues running whatsoever, but looked absolutely incredible in the process.

It's an enthusiast card for sure and for the *vast* majority of users the 3080 and 3080 Ti will be *more* than sufficient, but for the users who are able to spend a bit more for the absolute best experience then it completely makes sense so long as money and inventory isn't an issue.",rtx_3080ti_priced

" 

I predict that the 3080Ti will not sell very well (assuming it has a non-paper launch).

Those who are cost-conscious will buy the 3080. While it may not be the ""top 4K"" card, it's very close to it and very reasonably priced. It offers the best value-proposition for many consumers.

Those who are not cost-conscious will buy the 3090.

The 3090 is only about 10% \~ 15% better performance at 4K than the 3080 so for $300 it must fall in between or up to 10%+  in performance I'm assuming? If that's the case then this must me the most underwhelming Ti model ever.

And with leaked benhcmarks of time spy , the normal 6800 beats the 3070 in ray tracing with rage mode enabled. I think this year and next year will showcase so much win for amd.

Another note I had multiple tabs that day EVGA Nvidia Newegg cnh and that is by including multiple tabs of each one then I said forget this I'm going to focus just on Best Buy on all the other unnecessary tab and then my process order went through thankfully",rtx_3080ti_priced

"I wish nvidia just made cards whatever the bench mark of xx50 xx70 xx90(80ti) is and that's it. Just 3 cards(plus the titan) so it's not so splintered like intel CPUs. xx50, xx60(ti,OC,Super), xx70(ti,OC,Super) xx80(ti,OC,Super) is alot, that's approx 13-14 different cards when they coulda just waited and gave us the best of the best from launch.

Coulda completely skipped the slightly weaker 3080 and slightly stronger 3090 and called January's 3080ti ""3090"" skipped the current 3070 and make the 3070ti the ""3070""...etc. so now all you have to worry about is Manufacturer, card model(50, 70, 90, Titan) & with or without water-cooling.

It only leads to confusion to have so many different variants. I'd be pissed if I bought a 3080 when In just 3 months a stronger still price efficient/affordable version came out. Alot of the time when you get to the 50/60/60ti/70 range the difference in price is only $30-50 in-between...

Today I've been playing valhalla at 4k totally maxed out with resolution on 200. The 3080ti will be able to run at this level but the 3080 won't as its not powerful enough.

3090 dies will just be made into 3080tis and the 3090 will become far more rare (if that's even possible).",rtx_3080ti_priced

There probably aren't enough defective GA102 die's to meet the demand for the 3080 (which normally uses a lower tier GPU to get around this issue). So NVIDIA would have to start cutting down ""healthy"" 3090 die's and turn them into 3080's. They're not going to do that, especially now that they could use these die's for the 3080 Ti as well. It's a complicated situation but the blame lay with NVIDIA. Rumor has it they're already working on a GA103 die which will replace the GA102 die in the 3080, GA103 would be smaller but since the GA102 die has 20% of the cores disabled the final performance should be identical.",rtx_3080ti_priced

So, $999 is one buck under a thousand. But it is under a thousand, which is for many people the ""stupid money"" threshold. I have to admit it works on me, I wouldn't spend £1100 on a card, but £999? Fundamentally not that different, but different enough...",rtx_3080ti_priced
This is the card I've been betting on since 3000 series was launched. There was too massive a gap between the 3080 and 3090 and for high resolution/VR with super sampling many of us do actually need more than 10gb VRAM.

However, there will be people who game and do content creation, but their limited budget does not allow for a 3090. Placing a 3080ti with 20GB at $999 is a very attractive offer, as it is only 4gb vram lower; probably still sufficient VRAM for most of their projects.   


The 999 price point will definitely make it more accessible for people in this group.

Not that you'll ever be able to get a 3080 anyway without mashing F5 all day because they probably want you to buy the more expensive ti version.

Big pinch of salt with 3080Ti rumours but IF it's true, and this is the actual time frame, Nvidia was likely going to push out a 3080Ti around mid-2021 financial year and had to rethink that strategy with the 6900XT numbers as presented.

Unlike other people I personally do not feel they'd be moving to TMSC with the 30 series.

20 GB and some performance uplift for 300 bucks over 3080. 6800XT still seems like ridiculous value with 16GB memory and top tier performance. 

Still, Ti model will mostly kill 6900XT with almost same level of performance and 4GB extra memory and probably better Ray tracing + drivers, IF it is actually available too buy.

"From a gamer focused marketing point of view it seems like they wanted 20GB mostly to one up AMD with its 16GB across the board.

As part of a 3D animation studio that utilizes GPU rendering for output these cards are essentially bargain 3090s. 

Due to the limited memory on the 3080 we were almost forced to go for a small 3090 farm for more memory intensive scenes, complemented by a faster 3080 farm, as even with our 11GB 1080Ti farm we had to spend time optimising certain scenes. With a 20GB 3080Ti for 999 we don't have to make that compromise.

"That's basically what they are doing. The hair-cut on memory is about the only thing that lowers the cost. The 3090 ""WAS"" there 3080Ti by everything except the Ti label. The only reason it wasn't called a Ti was 'just in case' AMD was competitive at the high end, in which case they just might have to give up some of the pricing greed and renew the Ti label. Seriously, $500 difference and effectively its the same thing with a 4gig hair cut and some new printed boxes that show the base and boost frequencies being different, but that you'll be able to overclock to the same. What a joke. If you are one of the few that got a 3090 I'd be really ticked off that just 2 months later Nvidia does this. I could see a refresh 6 months in but this is just plain robbing your customer base.

Imagine you bought a Mustang GT with 480hp for $35,000 then two months later you can get the exact same stang with 475hp for $26,000(1/3rd less same as 3090 to 3080Ti).",rtx_3080ti_priced

"it's probably better to think of it as a price cut on the 3090, with some minor cuts to memory and a tiny cut to performance so that 3090 owners don't get their nose out of joint.  Like, you know the 1060 3GB, how it was the same-ish performance class but a few cut shaders and less memory?  This is a ""3090 20GB"", except branded as 3080 Ti.

People were bitching about the 10GB on the 3080 and how it would negatively affect longevity - well, this will fix that, and it's $999 instead of $1499 like the 3090.

Performance difference vs 3090 will be inconsequential because frankly the 3090 was already pretty much inconsequentially faster than a 3080 and this is only like 4 SMs cut off the 3090.  It'll land within 1-3%.

Was kind of on the fence about 3080, I don't *need* more performance, but DLSS and RTX would be nice.  If I buy I'd want it to last a long time again.  Not gonna jump for the 3090 either.  But at $999 for a 3090 20GB I might be persuaded.",rtx_3080ti_priced

"The 3090 isn't really a card for gamers, even though nvidia marketed it as such; you have to be somewhat insane if you think 8k gaming is yet a thing.

On the other hand 6900XT can in some realm of possibility be called a gaming card, because if you are some sort of creative professional in heavy 3d rendering applications, there is no way in hell you would choose 6900XT over 3090. But I think people at nvidia know that there isn't enough ""gamers"" that would look at the extra memory/memory bandwith that 3090 has compared to it with the mindset that ""this is totally worth 50% more in costs"". Would you pay 500 for extra 8 gb of vram and better memory bandwith? I hope your answer was no... if you don't work with blender or something similar. 

Only thing nvidia needs is to have a card with the same performance in games as the 6900XT and this is what they are trying to get to with 3080ti. 3090 is literally a workstation card.

"So when nvidia releases the Ti versions and has the same supply chain problems (which I’m well aware of, thanks), whose fault will it be then? Of course it’s nvidia’s fault. They’re directly responsible for their relationship with hardware partners such as Samsung and so forth. That relationship dictates how much of existing stock nvidia is allotted. It all comes down to $$$. So, yes. COVID and whatnot, but that doesn’t wholly excuse them. They could have handled this better.",rtx_3080ti_priced

"Idk after seeing AMD's marketing numbers on their launch presentation, them not having a massive performance edge over Nvidia even in that material kinda shows that a Ti model of the 3080 isn't really needed to be competitive. Especially with AIB models most likely closing that already small gap and needing a 5000-series CPU to really get competitive performance from AMD cards. I won't speak definitively, of course, but I'd wager the 3rd party benchmarks will at minimum show the same small performance gaps if not eliminating them.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Bad thing about them moving so fast with the 80ti is it's prolly same samsung 8nm node instead of the potential update to the TMSC 7nm which would have netted some nice improvements.

I'm miffed they decided to gimp the memory bandwidth on this as it's traditionally always the same as the top card (titan). With memory OC it will get damn close to the 90 anyways, what I'm interested to see what kind of bios/driver tweaks they give the card that make it better than the 90, cause if the 6900xt is beating the 90 then this card needs to be performing right out the gate.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"For me it's more the latter than the former. I've used Nvidia since I started owning computers in 2005, but what *keeps* me with Nvidia is the toolsets.

CUDA (now Optix) is crucial to some modern workflows in a way OpenCL just never really managed, in part due to ATI/AMD market share and in part due to unreliability in drivers from Team Red. Annoyingly even after the 8000 series way back, AMD had competition at several points, but the drivers always fell short.

Hell even now with the ""reinvented"" AMD, people's biggest concern with the 6xxx series from them is the driver stability. It's one hell of a weight to carry.",rtx_3080ti_priced

Fair points. Although the 6900 still retains the advantage in size and thermals. I wonder if they will come out with a 6950?,rtx_3080ti_priced
"Sorry, I meant with current non-RT performance, that I don’t think the 3080TI will compete with the 6900XT. 

I’m definitely going to be getting the 3080 TI if it is reasonably better than the 3080, but if it’s IPC increase is only an overclocks worth of performance I’ll probably just get the 3080 no matter what.

Knowing AMD, Nvidia should’ve prepared to have lower prices this time around, but obviously as usual pushed too hard and embarassed themselves. 

Nvidia needs to play this game carefully over the next year, or else AMD might actually out innovate them.",rtx_3080ti_priced

You can double the ram and pass it through the same size bus so 16gb still fits through 256, 20 through 320 and 24 through 384. Conceivably you could also double the bus size to match but even a 512 bit bus is physically massive (relatively) and a 768 even more so, to the point that it's not realistic to incorporate it into a system.

"> So, if you're upgrading from a 1000/2000 series and used to working with worse hardware, why wouldn't a 3080 suffice? 

It's exclusively because of the memory and the only reason we'd ever considering buying a 3090 over a 3080.

Unlike in games, rendering performance scales lineairly when using multiple GPUs (2 3080s will give you twice the performance of 1). Two 3080s will outperform a single 3090 by a huge margin at a lower price, provided we don't need more than 10GB. The reason we need more memory is two fold.

3D animation scenes can be gigantic. The sheer amount of geometry, texture and simulation data can easily go well above even 24GB. Considering in 3D animation fidelity rather than performance is the lowest bar, it's not always possible to easily work around those limitations, and can be costly.

The other reason is output resolution. Rendering at stupendous resolutions for promo materials has also seen incredibly memory loads.

We've ran into both these limitations with our 11GB 1080Ti farm, and the reason we were hoping for a gaming card with more memory capacity.

> Also, bonus question: I'd guess that buying a quadro or titan or similar enterprise grade card is not as good price/performance as high end gaming cards?

For our output which is purely graphics the price to performance of enterprise grade cards is in a completely different league, they only have an absolute memory advantage and the ability to share memory using NVlink (which the 3090 and supposedly the 3080Ti will also support aswell, effectively boosting memory to 48 and 40GB respectively should that ever be needed).

Basically if the rumours are true that we can buy $999 20GB NVLink capable graphics cards we don't have to consider splitting our farms into a small 3090 (NVLink) farm for memory intensive scenes and output, and a more substantial 3080 farm for volume price to performance rendering. We'd simply only get 3080Tis, which combines the best of both.

**Edit:** Just read the 3080Ti will not have NVlink. Makes sense, otherwise the 3090 would really have been obsolete.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Yeah, totally agree with your post, from a gamer standpoint it's not a particularly interesting deal compared to the 3080, I just answered your rhetoric question 'Who cares?' :)

I just started getting the components for my build and bought the monitor first. Ive heard that its best to try and max out the refresh rate of the monitor for the best performance. Ive also seen people say that its a good idea to lock the frames at 144 but i havn't looked too far into the validity of that claim yet. Since i pretty much only play call of duty id prefer to buy whatever gpu works the best for it. if the 3080 runs it just fine at a constant 144 then ill definitely stop waiting around and just try and get one,rtx_3080ti_priced

3090 is the flagship with increased vram to justify price. It is not a Titan.,rtx_3080ti_priced
"For Maxwell (2014) to Pascal (2016) we went from 4GB 970/980 and 6GB 980 ti to 8GB 1070/1080 and 11GB 1080 ti.  Pascal to Turing saw no VRAM changes.  Ampere's 3080 still has less VRAM than the 1080 ti from 2 generations before it.  VRAM also steadily increased before Maxwell.  If back in 2016 you said we're still looking at 8GB or 10GB for the reasonable GPU in 2020 people would've said ""bullshit.""  I mean in 2012 the 670 and 680 came in 2GB configs (though also 4GB).

If you told someone 5 years ago how great it was that the Titan-class GPU had 24GB of VRAM in 2020 they'd be like ""why is that great?  That's shit.  That's only doubled after *five* years?""",rtx_3080ti_priced
"> 3090 is simply a Titan without Titan drivers 

So basically, not a Titan.

Keep in mind 2080 Ti did not increase VRAM amount from 1080 Ti, while previous 2 gens doubled on the other respectively.

x70 class has been 8GB since the 1070 while previously doubling each gen prior...1.28GB with the 570, 2GB 670, 2GB 770 (680 rebrand), 4GB 970, and then 8GB 1070 and staying at 8GB.

Similarly x80 class doubled each gen until staying at 8GB for both 1080 and 2080 and then receiving a minor capacity upgrade to 10GB with 3080.

I am supposed to believe the 10GB 3080 is the upgrade path from an 11GB 2080 Ti? Does not compute.

Not because of the 10% better raw performance of a 3090, but because of the 3090's more VRAM.

There won't be too many optimized ports/games, just look at the Watch Dogs Legion catastrophy.

"Supersampling helps with a slightly better image quality (instead of using anti-aliasing). Though theoretically if VR games implement DLSS you could get that while still rendering at a lower resolution.

You can use supersampling for every game out there, but most people don't. Simply because it's extremely performance intensive for a very marginal gain in visuals.

It's a total edge case in my opinion. And you can supersample a little anyway:

VR headset pixels: 4,608,000

4K pixels: 8,294,400

Which means you could render at double the resolution (200%) of the VR headset and you're barely over 4K (11.11% over 4K to be exact). 10 GB will still be plenty for that.

For blender, 3ds max, etc.? Yes it is Titan class card, because drivers diffrence doesn't matter at all here, but VRAM is great.

For Siemens NX, Catia etc? No, it is not Titan class card.

For scientific/engineering workloads requiring FP64? 3090 is as good as Titan, here you should buy Quadro/Tesla (or Titan V that is diffrent).

For special usages like having super large screens like 16 displays etc. ? Quadro only.

Sharing VRAM between cards via NVlink? Quadro/Tesla only.

3090 is simply additional ""tier"" that didn't exist before. It fills a niche for 3d artists/content creators that do never needed Titan drivers, but needed more VRAM. And here it is a card more expensive then Geforce, but still cheaper then Titan or Quadro.

Edit: That being said nothing is a rule here. For example Quadro RTX doesn't have full FP64 performance(older ones did), Titan V has full FP64 performance.

I was able to take my i5 2500k in my server and take it from 3.3Ghz to 4.8Ghz while maintaining lower temps than it had before the AIO + overclock.

Personally, I don't really see air cooling and liquid-cooling as being on the same level at all. There are nice air cooling solutions for CPUs but I feel that a liquid solution for the same price would do better.

The only time my AIO was ever warm to the touch was when I first installed it incorrectly and the fan wasn't spinning, otherwise, it is better in every regard other than that they can be a bit louder than fans. Though there may be quieter liquid solutions than I know of and the silent fans still cost a good amount.

There has been 0 IPC change from the 6700k all the way up to the 10900k. It's literally identical. You can get higher clock speeds out of the later chips, but they also come at a massive power draw cost and are little nuclear ovens.

Obviously a big-ass custom water loop can accomplish that, but goddamn, gimme a break. 

So yeah, agree with toysoldier, fans are fine and good, but air is a tricky beast, and you can actually undercool your rig by having too many damn fans. They'll exhaust the cold air the intake fans are pulling in and the GPU/CPU won't actually get cooled.

"Should be better tho with more VRAM ""overhead""",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Because it has a newer architecture and GDDR6x.
You can't compensate physical VRAM tho. The high end VRAM chips of the 3080 end with 10 GB.
The moment the swapping, caching all I/O procedures start, the frametimes take a hit.

Let's talk after the 3080 has to deal with engines that aren't well optimized and Ultra HD Texture packs etc. and 10 GB VRAM could be a limiting factor while the 16 GB VRAM AMD cards and the 3080Ti just inhale and exhale and don't take similiar hits.

It this really was a ""non issue"" to begin with, all tech reviews would have ignored or skipped that topic. No one did. Guess why?",rtx_3080ti_priced
"What stops DLSS from using 4K textures???? it would be dumb for it to leave that wasted VRAM on the crappy textures...

Also the average bar graph is NOT a good indicator of micro stuttering, you need a full frametime graph, the 2080ti could very not microstutter when compared to the 3080, that said I doubt it will at all with 6000 series.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Yea they really are, ultimately it will be between the 3080 and 3080ti. I don't mind spending the extra 200 if it means more consistent frames and the ability to run an ultrawide when i end up buying one",rtx_3080ti_priced
Cheapest 3080 I see on uk sites is £799 which is well over €900. Where did you get a TUF that cheap??,rtx_3080ti_priced
"I went from 62 fps in GTA V to around 110. I went from 48 fps in Dead Rising 2 to 89. Damn near doubled. That's with my 3770k at 4.6Ghz and my 7700k at 4.8Ghz. I also went from 1600Mhz DDR3 to 3200Mhz DDR4. That played a role too but it's all part of the system upgrade and resolved a CPU bottleneck.

I don't feel pressured whatsoever by my normal gaming habits to upgrade to what's available today. Even the Ryzen 5950x doesn't appeal to me at all. I want a 10+ core Intel CPU with at least 30% more IPC and maintain the same ish boost clocks I have today. That's at least a year and a half away if not more.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Lol you only read what you want, right? 
MSRP for FE card in Spain is 715€ with VAT yet most AiBs are easily more with VAT as well. 

And NVIDIA could easily solve this issue given the dimension of the company by “setting up shop” here in the EU as well since it is such a huge market that will willingly and happily pay for their products in the blink of an eye.

"A $800 loss over the course of 2 years is nothing to a lot of people. Especially since they got to play with top quality for 2 years while nobody else did. It was definitely worth it for them. I mean do you complain if you buy a $50,000 car and then sell it 5-10 years later for half the price? No, it just means you can afford to do that and don’t care. 

Some people don’t want to wait 2 years. They have the money, aren’t gonna spend it on anything else, and want top performance.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Lol. You took the first few games that Hardware Unboxed that favored the 10900k and used it to favor your narrative. Then you somehow think Gamers Nexus are not as reputable with no evidence while mentioning their website's aesthetics are not up to par as if it mattered in any way. Furthermore, you think that them benchmarking CPU performance on medium 1080p was in any way trying to replicate the general consumer's case without even thinking of the fact that its purpose is to minimize GPU limitations while accentuating the differences in CPU performance.

"I do agree that the 10GB was a mistake (obviously not as big as the 8GB 3070) that said all the bandwidth in the world won't save you from running out of VRAM, it is just too much latency to go into system RAM at best, SSD at worst.

A bar graph is terrible for measuring micro stuttering you need a full frametime graph, the 2080ti could be smoother than a 3080 despite what that graph says.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"It's an extra 300 (MSRP $700 vs $1000). You really don't believe actual 3080 Tis will go for MSRP? :D

300 saved already gets you nearly halfway towards a 4080 (if a 3080 doesn't cut it any more in 2 years.. which is unlikely).",rtx_3080ti_priced

"You only read what you want to.

The AiBs 100% sell at msrp in their primary market, which is the U.S.

Those other companies have costs and it costsvthem more to ship to you and to do business in your country. Yes, they pass that increase onto you.

Im sorry you struggle with understanding basic economics and cant figure out your spec of a country is not the primary and that it costs them more to sell to you.

This isn't complicated. 

It costs the AiBs and retailers more money to sell video cards in your country, they wont eat that loss for you. Deal with it.

Their primary 100% sells msrp so your blanket statement is false and you really should learn to be specific instead of spread false information.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"You could make that argument for the 2080ti since it actually offered something tangible over the 2080. The 3090? It's really not going to offer much of anything over the 3080ti if the specs are to be believed.

If the only reason you have to justify the extra 500 over the 3080ti is ""I can afford to throw away money"", that simply proves my point that the people buying these aren't smart with their money.",rtx_3080ti_priced

"Yes that person used it with a 3090 but it’s not meant to be used on nvidia cards. Fidelity fx is optimized for amd cards and is amds response/competitor for dlss. They both use different techniques to compress graphics and in general the performance is actually pretty equal compared to dlss. But a big difference is that in every single game that has nvidias dlss, it actually lowers the  vram usage  of the card to even less than what the card is currently running at. So if an rtx 3080 is running the game at 4K max settings with 6-8gb of vram usage, then when dlss comes out the card will run the game using less than or close to the same amount of vram. AMDs software lacks in that regard, this is why everyone’s roasting amd in that thread because their fidelity software isn’t good at compressing and saving memory. I have no idea why that guy used it on his 3090, it’s not meant to run on nvidia cards and I’ve read that if you do it actually causes lag, he prob did it because he saw it as a setting in game whereas dlss isn’t out for it yet. In fact I just checked the YouTube video right now and his pinned comment mentioned he was getting frame skips and when he disabled fidelityfx (which would subsequently only make the card use 6-8gb of vram as what the original post was saying) the game runs smoothly.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"I agree with you that the VRAM topic is hysterical, and less because of the VRAM size but because of lazy devs. Well optimized games should be fine with 10 GB even under 4K if we ignore the additional 4K or 8K textures that take space and block allocation",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Yea that’s a good point, also I bet I wouldn’t be able to get one till like March so your probably right. I’ll try and get the 3080 when everyone is hyped about the 3080ti",rtx_3080ti_priced
I’d say price is much more now,rtx_3080ti_priced
"That's the benchmark which puts more emphasis on the video card. Standing in the same place in downtown with the same settings at the same time of day saw the improvement. If it isn't obvious that there's a GPU bottleneck there, look at how straight down the line at 1080p every CPU hits the same performance. That's not a true test.",rtx_3080ti_priced
Ok ;) xoxo.,rtx_3080ti_priced
I haven’t even looked at the specs of the 3080ti. I’m talking purely about buying the best GPU per series. The best GPU per series is always overpriced. But if people think they’ll enjoy it then that alone justifies the price to them.,rtx_3080ti_priced

Yeah I think we're done here...",rtx_3080ti_priced
"You are talking out of your ass, there is no DLSS equivalent from AMD, at least not yet.

No offense but if I bought an expensive card I expect to use the best textures since they don't increase or decrease FPS, this whole pay 800 to buy an almost obsolete lemon does not sit well with me.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"At least if you plan to play in 1440p 144hz+

For 4K you'd probably be fine too, but no guarantees there.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"It was a test with the best available GPU at the time at just 1080p. So obviously a real scenario. And the difference is 1-2 fps if you overclock both CPUs.

You might see up to 10 fps with a 1080 Ti (Which it seems you bought a year later? If you got the 7700K at release), but never even close to ""double"". Not even 50%.

You're seriously overestimating the difference between those two 4 core CPUs.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Lol its funny because you ONLY look at tax as in what you pay, that retailer has additional costs, taxes, and regulations, theres also shipping, different customs costs, and a little thing called volume. EU regulations alone increase cost and the volume doesnt make up for it.

They will only sell a few units in your country compared to markets like the U.S. so to make their margines they charge more, similar to your retailers. Further dont confuse Nvidia or the AiB companies with your local retailers, they are not one in the same and the AiBs and Nvidia do not get an additional cut for that retailer up is charging.

It always amazes me that so many of you cant seem to grasp simple economic concepts.",rtx_3080ti_priced
"Dlss and fidelity fx are directly compared to each other when benchmarking many games but ok. 

The point of that original thread still stands where nvidia gpus with their settings runs the game at 4K max with still plenty of vram left. You play godfall on a 3080 you use 6/10GB. You play godfall on amds new cards you use 12/16gb. Same amount of vram left. I get the skepticism but all the next gen games appear to run fine so far (with AC Valhalla only using 6) and when we do see limitations in 3-4 years is around when many people will upgrade.",rtx_3080ti_priced
Yea the ultra wide worries me because it’s about the same pixels as a 4K 27. One of the reasons I was considering wasting a bit of money on a 3080ti,rtx_3080ti_priced

If FidelityFX is turned on it means improving graphics, unlike DLSS that is of disputed quality, it can be ok (Control) or hideous crap (Watch Dogs)",rtx_3080ti_priced
"I'd say just wait for benchmarks, maybe the 3080 Ti blows everyone away. Or it barely makes a difference and reviewers show it doesn't matter if you have 10 or 20 GB VRAM in current and upcoming titles.

Nvidia really blew it in my opinion, a 3080 Ti should have been a 7nm TSMC relaunch in 6 months. With an actual 10-30% uplift.

GTA 5 doesn't scale performance beyond 4 cores 8 threads much if at all, and the 8700k was stock. This right here is almost EXACTLY what I saw going from a 3770k to 7700k.
