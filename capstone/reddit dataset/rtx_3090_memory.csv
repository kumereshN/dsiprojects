"That is terrible for the 3080 and the 3070. I have an RTX 2080 and the 8gb are already a problem, for example, when I use RTX in battlefield V it uses all the available memory and the game starts stuttering (if you lower texture quality you can get a better experience). Flight simulator 2020 is another game for which 8GB VRAM is not enough. I play at 1440p, at 4K the VRAM would be even bigger.

So 10gb/8gb means that none of this cards would be useful for raytracing or 4K, and that is terrible considering that they will cost 600$-800$ and an Xbox Series X appears to be able to do both of them. Looks like Nvidia is putting all the eggs in DLSS, unless they manage to put DLSS in every single game other, these GPUs are already dead....",rtx_3090_memory
"There is a big rumor behind Why the VRAM size hasn’t moved for the 3080/3070 is that:  
- for games developed now, there is currently no need for more than 10GB vram, and mostly faster vram is enough (GDDR6X, meaning faster writes and reads, which mean you need to buffer less stuff in memory if you can load it quicker).  
- for next gen games(2022+), with engines optimized for very high resolution textures that couldn’t fit all in VRAM, there is an hypothetical « NVCache » feature that would be able to use your extra RAM or even an NVMe drive as « slower » VRAM.

They still playing games with this shit. 1080ti fe was released @ $699.99 msrp and followed similar pricing to previous gen. Then the whole price hike due to console migration and bitcoin bullshit. They the released the 2080ti over priced (obviously because they can and the demand) now this bullshit. If the new gen cannot push 4K @ competitive fps it legit ain’t worth it.

I honestly thing with these new very powerful consoles coming out.  This might be a turning point. Because if they price these cards insanely high like they have been doing. They are going to definitely have a problem moving inventory.  Consoles force games to optimize to their hardware for years and years.  Pc games make hardware go obsolete.  If these console provide graphics and performance on par with these cards.  It's a wrap.,rtx_3090_memory

"\*sigh\*

I almost never play games and if I do (about a session every four months or so), I get by with my 1050 TI (4 GB). Which sounds ridiculous, I know, and I am well aware that my priorities are not applicable to most people, but I find that in HD I can play pretty much most current AAA games I'm interested in, maybe not at max details. I'm fine with that.  

But I am an avid 3d modeling / VFX amateur (not as a job, simply as something to wind down after work). That's why I have an AMD Threadripper and 64 GB of RAM (wish I could've sprung for 256, but that's simply not in the budget). And since more and more renderers are GPU only or are offering a (faster) GPU version and more and more effects in Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro are now GPU accelerated, I was planning on upgrading my graphics card.

But for 3d modeling, VRAM is everything. Professionals use Titan RTX cards (or something euqivalent), but since I won't spend 3000 bucks for a GPU, I had high hopes for the RTX 3000 series.

10 GB for the RTX 3080 is really disappointing and I don't think I'll be spending 1,400 for an RTX 3090 for what is basically a hobby. 1,400 gets me my Creative Cloud license and some cool 3d models, textures and plug-ins.

So, yeah, I'll probably bite the bullet and get a 3080, but only through gritted teeth.... It'll help some with Adobe, but for bigger scenes, I don't see myself using a GPU renderer any time soon.",rtx_3090_memory
"Was hoping to upgrade from my 1080 to a 3070 or possibly a 3080. But the 3080 only having 10GB and the 3070 probably ending up with 8GB kind of leaves a bad taste in the mouth especially with how much they will probably charge for the cards. 

I don't anticipate me gaming in 4K anytime soon, I'm still on 2560x1080 ultrawide and am considering moving up to 1440p 16:9, which still gives me concerns about future games and VRAM limitations.

"Don't know if anyone will read this, but isn't 1400$ for the 3090 with 24GB highly unlikely? Since the Titan RTX is 2500$ with also 24GB, I just can't see the 3090 be at anything lower than at least 1800$. On top of that, the VRAM on the 3090 will also be faster than the one on the RTX Titan.......",rtx_3090_memory
"I don't think a lot of people are processing that we are looking at GDDR6X-- not just GDDR6, and that there is a major difference between the two.  Looking at the smaller number of ram probably confuses most consumers, though.

'The key innovation for GDDR6X appears to be that Micron is moving from using NRZ coding on the memory bus – a binary (two state) coding format – to four state coding in the form of Pulse-Amplitude Modulation 4 (PAM4). In short, Micron would be doubling the number of signal states in the GDDR6X memory bus, allowing it to transmit twice as much data per clock.""

Thankfully, even at 3440x1440, given my patient gamer stance, 6GB hasn't been an issue yet. But 6GB in a 3060 that I'll likely be using 3-4 years from now in my living room setup would be disappointing.

My other issue is power draw. I aim for lower power consumption to reduce heat and noise. I have a near-silent Cerberus-X build on my desk. My 1060 at ~130W was fine. My 2060 at ~185W, not so much (but still acceptable, if cutting it close), even with the better fans on this particular unit.

However, in regards to the 10GB VRAM on the 3080, can’t it be a case of like how AMD Zen2 CPU:s has lower frequency but higher IPC, basically runs Intels CPU:s over in multi-threaded applications? 
You could even go to pixels on cameras, it’s more to it than the number,hertz,pixels etc. 

But I do understand that the 1080Ti came out a few years ago and the next best card that’s rumored to be priced decent, will have less amount of VRAM.

"Really....ok, well I now am 100% positive AMD will use this and put in at least 12GB and lower price point to nullify the 3080. 3090 exists to hold the benchmark crown, AMD does not need to chase that. At 12GB I would have considered the 3080. 

Regardless for me personally I have learned from last gen. I’m letting Nvidia and AMD go to war and drop their surprise Super versions and Ti or possible Ti Super to compete with AMD. I did early adoption once with Nvidia, got to badly burned.",rtx_3090_memory
"So just speculation here but 24gb vram makes me think of the radeon VII with its 16gb. While the 3090 may have the best performance in the stack it seems like its going to be there to compete with whatever content creator focused cards Amd puts out in addition to people who just think 'more money = more better'.

I'd guess that the 3080 and likely a 3080ti model will be the main focus of people in the gaming space for top end. Assuming that ends up being the case your 8gb 2080 upgrade path is a 10gb 3080 and if there is a ti variant expect a few gb more there as well. 

I don't think I've ever hit the 8gb vram usage on 1440p with my 2080 in any game, pretty sure I've never even come close. I will say that going from an 8gb 1070 to an 8gb 2080 was still a massive boost overall. I'd assume that the next gen of cards will at least be more efficient than the previous ones in one or more areas, gddr is probably one of them. 

Outside of speculation though I've seen people claim that X-Vram won't be enough for X-years since I built my first pc 10+ years ago. If you buy a top end card they will only be top end till the next gen, they will however continue to be fantastic cards for at least the life of their warranties, and they will stay perfectly playable for years after that. Medium settings exist... I've yet to see any cards in the midrange and above that make gaming unplayable in ""just a couple years"".",rtx_3090_memory

"There’s a lot of people on this thread who throw money at  whatever is the best and fastest, with no understanding of how electronics trend and evolve over the years.

It’s not the same VRAM. It’s faster. There’s been credible leaks (and this seems to prove it) that new technology requires significantly less VRAM moving forward. So we have significantly faster VRAM while needing significantly less of it. Now combine that with being at the upper echelon of what is generally needed now.

Do you think consoles will not hold this as a baseline *as they have for 20 some odd years?* And please, save your breath about fast SSDs and console optimization. We’ve heard it all before. CELL architecture, “supercharged PCs,” the same exact marketing lines by the same guy for three generations of console and people literally lap it up like its different. If consoles had 20gb of RAM/VRAM there might be some cause for concern. 

“But wait Kram, I run modded Skyrim at 2560x1440 @ 90 hz per eye and it requires 26gb of VRAM!” Reread what I said, or consider that being on the literal bleeding edge of technology in the 1% of users is expensive.

nope, developers first target the market that will make the most money for them, and then optimize for several different targets from there. 

Quite often for AAA games thst means  targeting the venn diagram of ""runs great on consoles"" and can run on 70% of the pc systems.  Then we see how far we can push the envelope. Targeting only high end cards is a loosing business proposition. Example:

https://www.eteknix.com/nvidia-confirms-poor-sales-2070-2080/amp/

While nvidia does not release specifics, a 45% revenue drop means that a lot of peopel chose not to upgrade. it could be because the economy, it could be price /performance issues, or it could be that most people are able to play the games at a setting that they enjoy it and don't care to upgrade. 

We are all enthusiasts when it comes to video cards, it creates a skewed reality when on a sub like this.  At work I have multiple cards I test against, but at home I have a 1070 (I was one who stayed out of the 20 cycle).  I'll be buying a 3080 this time around though, regardless of the specs because I'm ready to make the 4k jump as much as I can. Targeting that model would be suicide though - games sales would not meet budgetary constraints to even break even for anothr 5 years.

There's not 20 million 20xx cards out there, and we also deal with that  60-120 days out a game is $40, not $60, and goes down from there.  gotta assume that realistic success looks like ""5 million copies at $40 = $200 million"" as a hard top, including marketing and distribution costs, meaning that if we can't build the game for less than $100m its a gamble that's much more risky than the tick market on something you love.

Its just one of the factors. Another factor is rumored massive raytracing performance increase. Which allows you to run better RT implementations than now , which pushes you into even higher VRAM consumption. Look at the other people in this thread mentioning VRAM problems running current RT in specific games.

Another one is difference between how games are being optimized for consoles and for pcs, and general massive improvement in console hardware, including GPU, which will translate for even higher PC requirements, which again may need more VRAM.

They definitely need some fucking black magic with that compression technology of theirs , but so far i'm not full of optimism for 10gb's version of futureproofing.

My point is that there's way too much that can go wrong in next few years for 10gb model, all factors combined.

i do miss the amd driver package and interface tho, the all in one approach. some prefer it seperately, i dont. i hate that nvidia geforce experience requires an account and a few features are locked behind social media requirements which sucks. oh and streaming via shadowplay nearly killed my pc or at least it looked like it lol. the stream on youtube and on my screen looked like the gpu died, ngl i paniced a bit when i saw the kind of screen that indicates a broken gpu. 

i did have 2 random blue screens past saturday but they didnt come back. and who the hell knows whats at fault at such an occasion. might be windows, might be some driver conflicts, could be anything really. i think especially with amd people are quick to blame the gpu drivers when it could be many other things instead. i almost want to buy a navi card just to see how much of the reputation is true and what is not.

Consoles have 16gb of VRAM. Yes i said ""Total ram"" because they dont have two separate types like PC's do, just VRAM. This removes a step making the process from SSD to ***VRAM*** quicker.

I am saying that the new consoles are using high speed/low latency storage to memory solutions to allow for massive amounts of data streaming that isn't going to be possible on pc unless you have drastically inflated hardware specs(like more VRAM).

Change the filters and pick your type.  I'm a bit of a monitor snob so maybe not the best person to ask.  Here are some things I would recommend that most don't think about:

* IPS panels, Great color, viewing angle that doesn't distort light and color, so you can view from off center.
* 300 nits at least.  350 or 400 nits really makes your monitor pop in a great way
* Be careful with the new wave of VA panels, a lot of them are cheap and have high refresh rate, but are either very dim or have a lot of ghosting issues.  Took me about 2 before I found a good one.
* The golden ratio of resolution to screen size is 24 inch for 1080p, 27 inch for 1440p, 32 for 4k.  You can push those one way or another, but if you go lower than those sizes you are squeezing a lot of pixels into a space you won't be able to benefit much from.  4k 24 inch panel is a huge waste of pixels.

I also like some curved displays but that will bump it a bit out of your price range.  Let me know if you have any specific questions, I'd love to help.",rtx_3090_memory

Also once those launch prices drop like a rock for the previous generation.

This hypothetical involves finding out post release that Nvidia purposefully restricted the amount of memory on their 2nd highest tier card knowing that it was going to make it largely redundant as a top of the range card shortly after release all in order to make people more likely to buy a much more expensive 3090.

You might be right, but history is littered with companies that thought they could get away with bullshit because nobody was challenging them.

At over 20gb of vram the 3090 is leaning towards Titan pricing realistically $2000+,rtx_3090_memory

"I'm sure it will be *nice* having more VRAM- it always is, but even for games like MSFS at 4K you would be very hard pressed to find a use case where a card actually **runs out** of VRAM at 8 or even 6GB- let alone 10GB. The limiting factor in 4K framerates right now is not the amount of VRAM, its the actual performance of the GPU. 

&#x200B;

my 1060 can run AAA games at 4K and get 25-40 FPS on high settings, and come nowhere near hitting the limit of 6GB. It could have 48GB of Vram like a Quadro card, but that won't help me hit (imo) consistent playable framerates on max settings at 4k.",rtx_3090_memory
"Ok, its *utilizing/allocating* the extra VRAM, but do you lose performance without it? My 1060 can run warzone just fine at 1440p at 45-50FPS max settings (I play on 720p to get high framerates), and it only has 6GB. My brothers 2060S can hit those framerates (higher even) at 4K! and not come close to running out of the 8GB Vram. 

Its the same thing with buying more ram, yes if you buy 32GB of ram then windows will use a lot of it, will show you 'using' 20GB, but that doesn't mean you don't have enough system memory if you only have 16GB. Games will always allocate the extra VRAM, but thats not the issue. It only becomes an issue if you have a card with less VRAM and run out, and then your framerate tanks.",rtx_3090_memory

I think they're more likely to refresh the lower end lineup to eat up the market from whatever AMD ends up releasing. So that will depend on what AMD is able to come up with.

  


I also think Nvidia recognizes that the number of people that would leap from a 3080 to a 3080Ti 8 months later is very unlikely, when that same person could have just bought the 3090 at launch.

"Your argument doesn't sense when historically top-of-the-line GPUs were much, much cheaper. Again, look at historical pricing. Nvidia has been gouging since the end of 900 and start of 10 series.

No competition, exploding crypto market, so they arbitrarily cranked prices because people are willing to pay it. It has nothing to do with tech or R&D costs -- the prices are driven purely by demand in a borderline monopolized market (at least on the high end).",rtx_3090_memory
"I think the 3000 series will do that. Albeit a generation is only two years. Most games only need 4, with 8 suggested and that’s probably not changing anytime soon. The 10 is most likely 8 plus 2 dedicated for RT. Although the VRAM is something that worries me, I’d prefer AT LEAST 12 GB for the 3080. A premium card at premium price should have premium features.",rtx_3090_memory
"He’s making fun of Sony and their hilarious marketing BS that happens. Every. Single. Time. 

Sony literally said the ps4 has a supercharged PC cpu in its buildup. Just like now they are clearly clinging to their only advantage over Xbox. Go back and watch every single PS pre launch, skepticism with Sony is justified.",rtx_3090_memory

"Yes but that translates to next to nothing, especially if the engines that are designed to take advantage of them are at least a full year away, and that release window was pre-pandemic. 

This hasn't and won't be an exclusion to the ""bleeding edge of tech has to wait 2+ years before it's actually used properly"".

It doesn't matter what tech you make, devs are almost always at least 2+ years behind as a result of content development.",rtx_3090_memory

"> I’d prefer AT LEAST 12 GB for the 3080.

Agreed, that would've been a far more comfortable figure. But I'm not overly worried just yet, we'll know more once the official presentation's done and the first reviews and benchmarks are out.",rtx_3090_memory
"Well I remember they called it that because the system had a shared 8GB of GDDR5 that was used for both the VRAM and DRAM (similar to an APU). It had the advantage of having much faster memory bandwidth output, at 176GB/s vs the 68.3GB/s DDR3 found in the Xbox One. Iirc it was ahead of it's time compared to PCs, which were limited by DDR3.",rtx_3090_memory

"Can you give a source for all the bullshit you just spewed about how developers are a”year away from utilizing the technology”? You do know developers have had the PS5 dev kit for more then a year now? Right? You have no idea how this technology works if you think developers aren’t already using it, do I have to explain it to you like you’re five?

The technology is at the core of the system. It’s inherently part of the architecture. How do I make it any more clear? YOU CANNOT develop a game for the PS5 without inherently reaping benefits from the new SSD pipeline.

Don’t believe me? [Here’s someone else who can explain why the SSD in the PS5 is getting the praise it is.](https://youtu.be/4ehDRCE1Z38)

I’ve objectively proven why the PS5 SSD is inherently going to benefit (on a technical level) every title released. Just accept the facts man.",rtx_3090_memory

"True. I hate to say that 10GB is a rumor but it’s a consistent one. Although if the 3090 is 1400, then a 3080 Super should be roughly 1k and if it has 16+ GB, that’d probably be worth it to a degree imo. I can’t see the 3080 being more than 800-850. Especially if it’s at 10 GB",rtx_3090_memory
"No, they called it that because it had 8 cores. When most PC’s were using 4. They just forgot to mention that 8 slow cpu cores do not beat 4 fast cores. 

Fortunately for Sony that level of BS marketing is enough to convince people that PC and xbox are dead.",rtx_3090_memory

"I cannot stress enough how excited I am for this tech. Hopefully AMD/Intel will follow along and implement something similar in the coming generations.

Also, once the industry waves goodbye to PS4/Xbone we'll probably see games using SSD for all their worth and becomes a bare minimum requirement on PC across the board on AAA titles.",rtx_3090_memory
"Ya man I totally agree that the ps5 is going to be crazy good especially considering the price.  Not to mention all the exclusives its going to have.  Plus it has backwards compatibility with ps4, so all the great exclusives on ps4 that I missed out on I can eventually play on ps5.  It’s a hard decision.  Should I go with one or should I get both.  Sony is doing some awesome stuff with their custom parts that work together so well too.  Sitting back and relaxing with a giant screen in front of you can sometimes be a better or more immersive experience too.  But honestly I’m going to wait to see how the ps5 does when everyone gets their hands on it.  If it’s not as crazy as people are making it out to be, I might stick to pc.  If it has some serious advantages over pc tho, then I’ll probably go for it.  Exclusive games are definitely a big advantage.",rtx_3090_memory

*Cerny describes the PS4 design as a ""supercharged PC architecture,"" and a big part of that is the 8GB of fast, unified GDDR5 memory that both the CPU and GPU can call upon. ""If [a PC] had 8 gigabytes of memory on it, the CPU or GPU could only share about 1 percent of that memory on any given frame. That's simply a limit imposed by the speed of the PCIe. So, yes, there is substantial benefit to having a unified architecture on PS4, and it’s a very straightforward benefit that you get even on your first day of coding with the system.""*",rtx_3090_memory
