"5.4"" is small enough for most ATX gaming-oriented cases, and I wish wider coolers would catch on so we can have more heatpipes and larger fans.

If your case features 2x vertical mount PCIe slots beside the normal horizontal PCIe slots, the 3090 will certainly fit. If it is wide enough to support 140mm fans, you're probably alright (but measure first).

If push comes to shove and you simply cannot fit your $1500 GPU into your tiny case, the H510 will fit it fine at only $70 USD which I hope you can still afford afterwords...",rtx_3090vs3080vs3070

What we do know is it has an additional 1792 CUDA cores, which is 20% more CUDA cores.  It has the same ratio of additional RT Cores and SMS cores (+20%). It is clocked slightly lower at stock then the 3080, but it has more memory bandwidth.

Performance gains are not necessarily linear, but this gives you an idea of its potential increase over the 3080.  10% is probably too low of a figure, 15% to 20% is probably more realistic. We will have to wait for benchmarks and see though.",rtx_3090vs3080vs3070

GPU's are worse than cars when it comes to holding value, the moment you run electricity through a card you've dropped the value by at least 1/3.

Why? The person buying the card is taking on a *lot* of risk:

-they are at the mercy of the seller's working knowledge of a PC (seller could break the card removing it from their machine)

-the manufacturer's warranty could have been voided by the seller disassembling their card to either modify it or to perform extensive maintenance (not to mention how much of a pain in the ass it is to RMA a card you weren't the original owner of)

-they could have been using it to mine crypto which means it was more than likely overclocked for extended periods of time

-the seller could be dumping a bad card on an unsuspecting buyer  

-the seller might not be trying to sell the card at all and are actually trying to rob you (makes sense, GPU's are expensive and resales are almost always done with cash)

-if the seller overclocked the card you'll never know if they did it properly or just shuffled some settings around until they got the results they thought they wanted, which could result in permanent damage

-there's no guarantee whatsoever that when you get the card home that it will be in perfect working order

So you don't even use something high res like the Index? Just the default res or some slight SS with lesser HMDs like CV1/Rift S/Vive/Quest...? Well no wonder you don't use up your VRAM. You just don't play with high enough res. Try an Index and Skyrim with those hires texture packs, and some SS on that to look extra nice.

Even outside VR you could need more VRAM for some titles, like Microsoft Flight Simulator, it EATS all VRAM anyone has, especially if only 10.

Besides gaming, 10GB is not enough for AI learning. I like to do DeepFakes, and just 10GB is used up immediately throwing ""out of VRAM"" messages even with small projects and lowres image sources. So I personally need as much as possible for that, not just for gaming. And next gen gaming titles both VR and non-VR will require more than 10, so getting a 3090 is just future proof.

"> a yes would be a false statement.

You seem to be completely fine with false, assumptive statements as shown here:

> Its cool **you are upset you can't get a dirt cheap high end graphics card**, but that doesn't make people greedy for selling their cards for a price that others are happy to purchase it at.

It's odd that your takeaway from all this was that I care about myself getting screwed over.

Or perhaps this is all because you suck at reading because here's what I said:

> It was so bad that I actually put up a PSA in the computer parts section of my local Craigslist page **to steer people away from the greedy pricks**.

I don't fuck with Nvidia, or at least I haven't in about 6 years now, because their pricing is some of the most egregious in the world of computer parts. When people get fucked over on computer parts it can kill their passion for PC gaming and that's something I refuse to tolerate.

"To reiterate since apparently my point wasn't clear:

AMD is a fine choice if you're considering a low-mid range card. They are very competitive there. However, the second you step into the more ""enthusiast"" realm, Nvidia beats them handedly. They couldn't come close to the 1080ti, didn't come close to the 2080, and will certainly not come close to the 3080 unless they pull something crazy. 

If you're in the market for an Nvidia 60-70, definitely cross shop with  AMD. If you want max performance at a higher tier, Nvidia is the only option.",rtx_3090vs3080vs3070

Now when game developers start utilizing the pcie 4.0 bandwidth and writing instructions that take advantage of it, then maybe amd might gain ground in gaming... but I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath or base my purchasing decision on pcie 4.0.

"I find it highly amusing that you try to attack me by saying 'folks like you'.  I have not said nor implied that I have tried to sell a graphics card for such price.  A price, I might add that is lower than the Retail price of the exact same card.  But you just assume that I am some 'greedy prick' because I call you out on being insulting and attacking people.

You are the one who seems to be trying to project ideals at people.  Insulting them and attacking them just because they don't fit within your world view.  So why don't, instead of being a jerk and saying bs, you just leave it alone and let people live their lives happily.  A person sold a used product, that was still viable and useful to someone who was willing to purchase said product (even though they could have purchased a new one for 50 dollars more).  Since the 2080 is not sold out everywhere, nor did the OP sell it for an exuberant price above the retail value, it would be a hard claim to say they are being greedy.  More like you are being greedy with the desire to purchase said products for cheaper than their actual value.  As for 'I don't fuck with Nvidia' bs.  Then why would you care if someone happily purchases their product, unless of course you just want them to be unhappy for getting, what they consider, a good deal.",rtx_3090vs3080vs3070

As for CPU‚Äôs, it‚Äôs in amd‚Äôs court. So long as intel isn‚Äôt pushing out sub 14nm, amd is going to be the top choice except for those that are pure gamers looking for those few extra frames. 

Amd needs to diversify their hardware investments. They are stuck on the consumer market and have had an almost impossible task of breaking into the commercial/business market.

Intel has stated they aren‚Äôt going to have 5nm chips out until late 2021 and by then amd is already going to be on their second or even third round of 5nm chips, probably looking at 3nm. Intel can‚Äôt just keep pumping power into their 10+++nm chips to beat them. I agree in a lot of tech sectors intel will just stick (I haven‚Äôt seen an amd pc ever in my 8 years in the navy).
