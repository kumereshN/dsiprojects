"What do we do in new zealand and australia when we're being scalped by the actual retailers?

The MSRP is 1139 AUD for the founders in Australia (which already easily covers GST and shipping) , but I didnt see a single card under 1300, and most were 1400.

New Zealand is no better. Converting the Australian MSRP to our currency we should be seeing cards start at 1250-1300 like 2080 supers cost over here, but the cheapest is 1475, and most are 1600 bucks.

Can we expect these prices to go down? Or are we stuck with this.",scalper_warning

He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those VPNs, take this beast out, and break their grip on 3080s.",scalper_warning
I love the idea of these scalpers having multiple cards they can't sell. Fuck these guys. Just like the people who bulk bought hand sanitiser and toilet paper and then tried to get a refund when people wouldn't pay £5 a roll.,scalper_warning

"In concept of course this is true. 

Except NVIDIA chose to hype this card up, then price it substantially more aggressively than anything on the market for its performance. 

Then they launched during a global pandemic where people sadly are clinging on to small positives. It’s not normal times. 

To then (a tech company!?) be thoroughly lamped by bots and scalpers just suggests the company doesn’t really care. Not about the humans anyway. 

So yeah, I think the way this was done has been shameful. And to now appeal to the very people who have been frustrated by their tactics and make it our responsibility to now “do the right thing” just makes the experience go from a bit frustrating to really quite insulting. 

This is their mess. They have the tools, capacity, messaging and ability to make this problem disappear. Why are we being asked to fix it?

"Ebay/PayPal should find a way to limit/stop these assholes. I mean eBay keeps a pretty good track of ""trending"" prices and MSRP. If a brand new item gets listed and goes over say 25% the auction would automatically end. And if said scalper found a way to beat that system, then eBay could flag/limit their account pending investigation.

I mean PayPal hassled me last week for selling a used 5700xt (that actually sold for more than I paid new for it) and a pair of phones that the wife and I had upgraded when we switched carriers.. they wanted to know more about ""my business"" and my ""vendors""

I mean if PayPal used their powers for good, they could stop these scalpers in a heartbeat..

Nvidia knew this was gonna happen though, they had been hinting at limited stock for a couple months (they say due to ""Covid supply issues"" but it's a ""keep supply low so demand will be high"" scenario. They could released WAY more cards so everyone would have a fair shot at getting one. But that's not their style. And now it's speculated there aren't going to be anymore till next year..

Well it seems that $300 over MSRP will get you a 3080...sometime.

But there's a *wall* of Zotac cards at around $1000.   Not only is that a terrible brand - no warranty probably and I think Zotac's warranty is bad, so you'd be paying $1000 just to 'have' a 3080 but not a good one.

I truly wonder who the real scalpers are. As an example the EVGA FTW3 Ultra is $800 on the EVGA site. Converted to £ that’s roughly £620. Overclockers here in the UK are selling it for £900. That’s a pretty steep mark up for import taxes don’t you think? Food for thought,scalper_warning

&#x200B;

Anyone know what a **teaser rate** is? It's like when you see that car being advertised for an insanely great price only for you to go to the dealership and be told, ""It already sold. But we have something like it. Costs a little more, though"".

$699 for a 3080 is the teaser rate. Nvidia hyped everyone up with insanely great performance hints on the 3080.

You all wanted one. Then, the insanely cheap price was announced. Every one wanted one.

Problem?

Nvidia never had the stock of 3080's in the first place. The retailers never had the stock in the first place ... and they had to know they didn't. The run their own merchandise tracking systems. Why would retailers go along with all the Nvidia hype, knowing they would never have enough stock to even satisfy basic demand.

Release day comes.

Nvidia never counted on the bots & Ebay taking what few 3080's were actually available.

No one can blame the bots for Nvidia overselling the hype and under-delivering the cards. Bots are not responsible for retailers on the Nvidia hype-train who KNEW they never would have sufficient stock to satisfy basic demand.

*So, what did the retailers get to go along with the scam?*

Does anyone seriously believe that retailers do not know their own stock? If you do, send me $14.99 and I will deliver you the Moon, someday. No guarantee in the next 1000 years. Offer not valid in the entire Universe. Send me your money, anyway.

The backlash was swift. I am betting Nvidia shat their pants reading the forums of pissed-off consumers.

Oh, look. A few can now pre-order SOMETHING for delivery in October, November, and soon to be December and even NEXT YEAR. Nvidia had to do something to placate the consumers. That is what they come up with.

Hey, could be worse. In The USSR, you ordered your car years in advance.

&#x200B;

**NVIDIA'S (NOW DESTROYED) MARKETING PLAN:**

Generate the **hype**. Oh, look. Mystery. NDA on performance. Nvidia releases videos showing massive improvements. Well, that is sort of falling down. The cards are not 2x the performance.

**Limited release with teaser rates. A form of bait-and-switch.**

Car dealers do it all the time, as noted above. And IT WORKS.

The lucky few who get some? They generate the hype.

You hear from 10 people about how great their ""friends"" card is. They never mention a name. It seems like 10 people got the card. When those 10 people know the same person.

**Word of mouth advertising** about how great the card is by the lucky few who somehow managed to get the card.

Teaser rates EXPIRE. The true price would have been a few hundred dollars higher, especially with the Nvidia tax on 3rd party manufacturers. Who Nvidia could blame for rising prices. As well as demand created initially with teaser rates, restricted supplies, and a lucky few spreading the word among the masses about how great the 3080's are.

&#x200B;

**THE GREAT NVIDIA F\*CK-UP**

**BOTS**. Go check Ebay for where most of the very, very few cards that were to be sold to the public; actually ended up.

The planned hype marketing machine, bolstered by a lucky few consumers spreading the gospel seemingly like an Army of Nvidia, with Nvidia bragging about how great demand is... as prices then rise to their more realistic level in the coming months.

**BOTS DESTROYED THAT. And yes, the bots are evil.**

Nvidia is forced to take pre-orders that won't be delivered until Oct, Nov, and soon... December and probably some won't get their card until next year. Or maybe Nvidia will actually pay lots of money to jump to the head of the manufacturing line.

Because, they pissed off a lot of people. Nvidia knows it. They only have to placate enough consumers, for that is what you are.

&#x200B;

MARKETERS have been heavily in psychology since the 1920's. Far longer than you have been alive. They have honed their arts for almost 100 years and passed that knowledge down. Their methods work. What seems as new methods today, are merely time-tested & true methods rebranded to get you to buy things. They know most consumer's buttons and which ones to push. Sometimes Madison Avenue screws up. They didn't count on the bots.

Nvidia did not count on being exposed by bots and the bot owners and Ebay market. A massive miscalculation on Nvidia's part. They should have given the last few incidents. And with the economy like it is? More people are desperate to make money any way they can.

3080 was a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for SCAMMERS to target with their BOTS. Nvidia and Retailers got caught with their pants down. They would have pulled it off if it were not for the bots & scammers.

Nvidia still got payed. You got played. Here's some crumbs. You just have to wait for awhile to get your crumbs. Now fork over your cash, pre-pay for the pre-order. October 31st is coming soon and sales numbers must be up. CEO's & Board Members & Upper Management need their bonuses. Rich investors want their dividends.

**THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL.**

GOOD LUCK, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.

To those lucky few who managed to get their cards? Fantastic.",scalper_warning

1- Cancelling those won't put them back in stock for someone to purchase them

2- At least on TopAchat, the price already inflated (+100/150€ depending of the model, so gross), meaning that I would rather sell either my FE or my Gaming X, depending of what my final choice will be (not counting the FTW3, no shipping date, probably going to be cancelled aswell), to someone who wants it in a near future (unlike what online shop can deliver).

Simply waiting for a restock isn't going to work because they will just get them all again and hold a monopoly on the cards until people buy them.

The real issue here is that these retailers are not limiting orders to 1 or 2 per customer and they're not using captcha. Some aren't even requiring valid email addresses for accounts. 

Online retailers need to combat the bots so real people stand a chance at getting these cards.",scalper_warning

"Scalpers aren’t even the problem, they’ve always been there but NVIDIA put out such a low supply knowingly driving prices to skyrocket. They had to have known and they most likely did this to appease their stock investors. The stock news thinks this launch was a huge success and the demand was high even reporting the insanely high second hand market on eBay and its exorbitant prices as a sign of progress for the company...

All in all, scalpers wouldn’t be a problem if there simply was a decent amount of initial supply of the gpu...Nvidia could have handled it differently by allowing preorders to gauge the supply amount needed before hand as well.",scalper_warning

Scalpers play the system making any shortage much more pronounced and longer term. Scalpers use bots to play the system so they can rip you off by the shortage they created.
Sure Nvidia could have waited until they had the 35 million cards expected to sell but that is a stupid business strategy and everyone would then be bitching about having to wait.

There was no need for Nvidia to release the 3080 when they did. The next gen consoles are not even out yet and people who would buy a 3080 would probably not care if the consoles came out first. They'd buy a 3080 anyway. Nvidia should have waited until they had more stock and a secure way to sell cards to actual gamers not crypto currency miners or scalpers.,scalper_warning
"The issue with expecting msrp is that you don’t figure in things like tax and then shipping. If I sell a card I am not gonna sell it at a loss. 

Then top it off, I am not gonna sell it it at the corrected price that includes the tax and shipping without valuing my time I took to stand in line and get it. Buying from a “scalper” is saying you don’t care what you had to pay to be first to get it, but you sure as shit weren’t willing to take risks and potentially wait in long lines with dirty people or waste your time standing in line for hours on end. Time waiting should be compensated for the seller. 

So let’s say I get in line at 6pm to buy the card. I take a day off of work to make sure I can be wary enough and then sleep the next day. In my case the stores open at 10a.m. That’s 16 hours of waiting. My time isn’t free. I am not a minimum wage employee. I will round it to a whole number that is easy to work with but is still less than I make. $50 an hour x 16 hours = $800 that is what my time is worth waiting in line. So if I am to sell the card with an 8.25% tax rate, the card in store assuming the card is priced at $725, would cost me $784.81 after tax. Considering most people that are gonna pay a premium for my time overnight shipping is a must. It’s gonna cost around $75 for shipping. So the total before my time cost is gonna be $859.80 and that is just so I do not lose out of pocket.

Now remember when I said my time costs money and that period is worth $800. Now you are looking at $1659.80 just so I break even. That’s a hell of a jump in a premium but it is a fair price if you are willing to pay it. 

In no way do I support scalping and flipping as many cards as possible, but if you decide that you’d rather get a different model later than a day one model because it wasn’t exactly what you wanted, then if you are only selling the one card... I see no problem.

The issue becomes when people run bots and buy multiples and sell them all with inflated premiums because that does create false inflation. 

I also think that to call out everyone as scalpers is wrong. They do exist but not everyone selling the card is a scalper. Some people simply don’t want to invest the time to acquire the card and money to them is nothing. 

People whining about the resellers calling them all scalpers are children because they didn’t get their day one card. Boo fucking hoo hoo. Grow the hell up.",scalper_warning
"I got one and flipped it for double. Sorry, I got bills ya’ll!",scalper_warning

"Except come October when they do come back in stock the inflated demand will “justify” higher prices.  You’ll see very few FEs for sale at $700 and many, many more AIBs but well above msrp.  3080 is an $800+ card that’s been paper launched at $700.  All so Nvidia can point at  the FE for the performance/$ argument against AMD.

Sadly it shouldn’t be needed as DLSS and superior RT are worth the higher price tag.

I don't get why people are worried, in previous releases nearly everyone who wanted a card could get one within a few months.  I'd be pretty surprised if by November 19th (Cyberpunk's release date) there was many people still struggling to get one at MSRP.",scalper_warning

After reading the anger on the forums? Hey, limited pre-orders at the ""teaser rate"".

$699 was always a teaser rate to draw the suckers into paying more money later. Teaser rates EXPIRE.

It's the old car dealership scam adapted to the GPU market.

 

1. You see an ad for a great price on a car you’ve been considering.
2. You get to the showroom and find that’s only for a stripped-down model, or trim level in auto lingo, which no one ever buys. Or has been sold already.
3. The salesperson is sympathetic. When was the last time you saw a car with crank windows and no air-conditioning?
4. Over the next hour, he or she shows you better-equipped versions. By the time you finally see the car you thought the ad was touting, you’re paying $4,000 more.

The price increases for Nvidia would have come later, citing ""demand"". That's the twist. One of them anyway.

"Hey gamer I have also been pretty upset with what the scalpers are doing and I have come up with a flawless method of fighting back although I don't recommend it because it's fairly scummy and you'll see why

For this method you will need the full price that these shitty resellers are asking for and you will a fresh new PayPal account I'll explain the process step by step

Step 1 go out and buy a prepaid visa card and load it up with the amount the reseller is asking for plus tax

Step 2 link this prepaid Visa card to your freshly made PayPal

Step 3 go on ebay and buy the card from the reseller for the full price 

Step 4 after the card has shipped to you file a product not as described claim and its very important that its not a product not as described case and ask for a $400 refund and if you're really feeling mad you can ask for the full refund and ship them a fake card or something of equal weight back to them

Reasons why I think this will work is because from my experience ebay will always side with the buyer no matter how sketchy the claim is and this method abuses that! If you try this and get it to work you are amazing and will teach those resellers to stay out of our domain and go back to scalping footware they should have never messed with us gamers!!!",scalper_warning

"I called this yesterday afternoon as soon as the fiasco started to die down.  Retailers **DO NOT WANT TO SELL 3080s RIGHT NOW.**  Why?  Because they're still sitting on piles of 2080TI stock w/ an MSRP over $1200.  The 3080 @ $700 DESTROYS the value of the 2080TI.

If the 3080 moves up to $1000+ retailers will then bring 2080TIs down to $1000 and sell them at the same price - still a poor value proposition, but people will pay that if they think it'll be another 3 months before they can get their hands on a 3080.",scalper_warning
Same here. All the 3080's you can preorder are \~900 euro.,scalper_warning

If they are within the return period they could just return them,scalper_warning
They‘ll be holding a bunch of cards that are esentially of no use to themselves,scalper_warning
Doesn't happen. They will reduce their price until the card sells. As long as demand outstrips supply they can't lose. Few people will pay $1500 for a 3080 right now. Almost anyone willing to pay $800 will pay $900. The price they'll get is somewhere in between.,scalper_warning
"sadly unlike other commodities like shoes they can do a ton with these cards

Selling them to miners would be a start, while not as profitable as an ASIC these have been the most cost efficient cards in a while 

Return them since most retailers offer up to 14 or 30 day return policy

The best move is to keep wasting there time, if you want to bid then go ahead but only bid up to MSRP so they don't get any profit. but the anti-scalp bots on eBay are doing their job pretty well so they won't let you anyways lol",scalper_warning

"There are a lot of people who want to buy these cards. Having enough in stock to satisfy demand on day 1 would require nvidia either: 

* spend months building cards and letting them gather dust in a warehouse before releasing them all at once. Not only is this wasteful (those cards could be put to use in that time) and expensive (storage isn't free), it makes it very easy to misjudge demand. If they estimate they can sell 1.2M units at MSRP, but there is only enough demand for 1M units, they're likely to take a loss on the remaining 200k units.

* invest massively in fabs and production lines such that a week's worth of production matches the first week's demand. But once all those initial buyers have purchased cards, they're unlikely to buy another. Thus nvidia is left with far more factory infrastructure than they can use, and again take a massive loss.",scalper_warning

"I don’t like scalping for profit—the handful of times I’ve had to ditch concert tickets, I’ve just shown up at the venue early, found fans (I assume they’re “true” fans if they’re there at that time without tickets hoping for a stroke of luck), and sold my tickets for face. 

That said, it’s arguable that A) people who have amassed the amount of disposable income to not care about the price premium have the semi-intelligence to get to that point (I don’t imagine inheritance makes up the bulk of the extra dollars being spent, which would be an exception) and B) time is more valuable than money. 

As much as I don’t buy (no pun intended) into scalping, I also don’t agree with the argument that only “true” fans *can* camp outside a store, or spend hours on the computer refreshing product pages. For example, if someone has kids or incredible work responsibilities that don’t allow them untethered blocks of time—and also aren’t rich—I don’t think it’s objectively “idiotic” for them to trade some money in exchange for the opportunity cost of not having to spend the time on traditional non-scalping measures. How much money someone’s time is worth is relative. Shaming other for trading cost for time is essentially like someone saying (and some do!) that any “semi-intelligent” person shouldn’t pay the delivery fee + tip premium to get a pizza delivered vs. picking it up.

If they estimate they can sell 1.2M units at MSRP, but there is only enough demand for 1M units, they're likely to take a loss on the remaining 200k units.

why should I care? There are people, whose job is exactly that. If they can't do their job properly, then it results in the situation we have right now and I say: ""don't wanna earn money by selling one of your products to me? Too bad, guys... too bad""

The fact that the vendors are fulfilling them and the precedence it sets. I dont imagine my reply will allow you to gain clarity on my perception. You appear to be someone that just wants to be right, but you are definitely not someone that is going to preach to me about injustice. Be real or enjoy a nice fucking off.

There's a tendency in some cultures to blame the person fleeced and focus on that instead of the bad faith actors.  We call the fleeced stupid, because it's a way to signal we're smart...and it's a convenient diversion for the bad faith actors.

Fact is, however much we want to appeal to the sort of people who'd buy from scalpers it's not going to help anything.  The only way to help is focusing as much of the hate as possible on the scalpers and the companies that aren't really trying to stop them.

Ok here's math for you.

2000-2500€ ( 2500 already goes in pretty well - well-paid area avg is I think 2k-2,1k )

300-600 goes instantly away ( tax, healthcare and other stuff  Usually directly cut from your pay and forwarded to the needed stuff like health care and taxes so you don't need to.)

400-800 Rent

I took the middle ground each time1200 left.

Now do Gas, electricity, insurance, Internet and other running stuff you need.

Easily sub 800-900

Now consider clothing and household articles now your at around 600-700.

Now eat from that and pay transportation ( cheapest )

Will be around 100-250€ left per month ( no entertaining at all no games or anything )

Now consider a Car also in this and you're literarily ending up with 0€ each month. I mean true if you earn 5k per Month ( absolutely wealthy top 10% or so here )Sure you will have plenty left but most scrubs here earn around 2-2,5k ( and there's plenty of jobs UNDER THAT even )

&#x200B;

Disposable income is sadly 100% dependant on the job and pay. Even if I would move in the shittiest location here literarily run by gangs I would still only get around 100 per month out of it.

"I think I understand your meaning, but actually there's no dichotomy here at all. 

For someone who is significantly wealthy, purchasing decisions are taken in a totally different frame of mind. The price of an item becomes far less important than its perceived value. I could never even dream of affording to buy a supercar, and so when I buy a car it's a calculation of how much I can afford to spend against how much I want a particular car. If I could afford a supercar, the decision would probably become 'how long will I have to wait to take delivery?' If *this* supercar is available in six months but *that* one isn't available for 18 months, even if it's $100,000 cheaper, I'll take the one that's available sooner. 

House purchases are usually a compromise: I can afford *this* house, but only because it's further away from the city centre and my commute will be an extra 2 hours each way. But if I take a property with a shorter commute then I can only afford *that* house. But if I am very wealthy I can afford *this* house even with the shorter commute - or even just around the corner from where I work - and so no compromise is required.

If I'm very wealthy, and I buy *this* GFX card now, I'm going to have to pay $1,000 more. But since I will earn more than that before lunchtime tomorrow (and will do every day for the rest of the year, and for the foreseeable future) why should I hold back? I *might*, on a point of principle, but that's a personal issue. Maybe I don't care that a 'scalper' will get some of my money?",scalper_warning

Sadly you are correct in looking for a solution, though I'm not sure raw hate is effective as a means of mitigating scalping. Shaming those that enable them however may work on the other hand. The best bet is focusing on the vendors and having them wise up and make this much harder, if not impossible to do.

"> becasue they are not victims as you suggest so much as enablers

This is some mental gymanstics.  By this definition everyone hit by a scammer is an enabler.

>  I also feel a good dose of logic and rational thinking is how you overcome said weakness. I blame both parties. However I expect scalpers to do what they do as long as it is viable. Where as I see no real excuse for the weakness and thus no reason to offer any forgiveness for it.

This shows a pretty fundamental lack of knowledge of how people work.  To think just shouting at people to be rational and judging them will fix anything is, in itself, irrational.  This has never worked in the history of mankind, this is why we create consumer protection safe guards and laws in place.

There is a level of insanity in most human decision making.  We've all fell victim, we rationalize our own mistakes in various ways but are often sure to draw the line on what were mistakes and what were moral failings just beyond what we did and before what others do.  Beyond that not protecting weaknesses like these leads to a worse society.  People falling prey to faith healers, homeopathics, Nigerian princes, false advertising and emotional manipulation just damages cogs within the machine that is our economy, making it less efficient.

The sort of thinking that blames the victims and not the victimizers is a serious problem in the world now.  We cannot expect everyone to be rational and sane, it's not how humans work.  We need to prevent people from preying on the irrational and insane.

I mean hate as hyperbolic, not a personal hate.  Shaming enablers has literally never worked en masse.  Maybe your buddy you've known for a long time can be convinced, but not the millions of other vulnerable people.  This is the same problem with people who fall victim to cult-like advertising campaigns, multi-level marketing schemes or whatever else.  It's making poorer, less educated or more mentally or emotionally vulnerable people worse off...and at this point in most of the world that accounts for a vast majority of people.

The vendors likely are the best immediate people to target, but I'd support laws preventing scalpers in general.  15 states have anti-scalper laws, getting a federal law in place might help or just encouraging more states to implement these laws.  Examples of laws I've seen that I think are good are one's that limit markup beyond MSRP within a certain time frame of purchase. Violations are usually misdemeanors, but don't prevent reselling antiques.",scalper_warning

I like how Newegg had the audacity to say that “No bots bought from us.” - while actual photos of bots buying a dozen off Newegg were in circulation.

Ignorance is only an excuse for so long though. Then it's on the individual that makes poor choices from there. There are NO victims here, you cheapen that word by applying it in this scenario. Pointing fingers and not assuming any blame is the problem in this scenario not any form of victim blaming. 

At no point did I insinuate that shaming people overpaying was a solution that would work en masse either. I said that would be better than raw hate aimed at scalpers. And that focusing on vendors was the best avenue in terms of any solution. 

Laws unfortunately are hard to enforce online in a global market. For example none of the laws you speak of have any bearing in Canada. Assuming Identical laws did exist what's to stop someone in Europe, Asia, or Africa from reselling at a higher price then? Assuming it became a global law. It would just be on the dark web and black markets instead. 

Unless we can educate the people that make these bad decisions not to, and not to fall for ponzie schemes and the like. This does not go away. Vendors can mitigate this substantially with things like limits per purchase and captures. It still won't stop one person from buying one unit and reselling it though.

> At no point did I insinuate that shaming people overpaying was a solution that would work en masse either. I said that would be better than raw hate aimed at scalpers.

Scalpers are the predators here...the one's with the ethical transgression.  We didn't tell Bernie Madoff's victims to just ""get gud,"" we punished the person taking advantage of vulnerable people for profit.  They are the one's creating false scarcity for a profit.  Going after them through regulation and the vendors as an immediate safe guard is really the only thing that will help.

> Laws unfortunately are hard to enforce online in a global market. For example none of the laws you speak of have any bearing in Canada.

Sure, but no offense, Canada doesn't really matter here.  I'm referring to US laws as eBay and many places scalpers used are located in the US. If the states their in, or the US federal government outlaws scalping that can significantly reduce it.  It would be great if Canada and/or it's provinces re-implemented scalping laws and made them have more weight, but that really only helps to an extent.

> Assuming it became a global law. It would just be on the dark web and black markets instead.

This is generally not the case, I'm sure some would go up there, but it's not like someone in Somalia is able to purchase the stock being shipped to the US, Canada, EU or Asia.  Most companies, NewEgg for example, don't ship to a number of countries.  Beyond that most people wouldn't know how to get onto a black market, few are going to spend the time and take the personal risks needed to gain access to those.  It's different with blanket ban items like drugs because that tends to be a more than one time need and there is no legal means to get them otherwise.  We saw this in practice when Silk Road had that spin-off The Armory for weapons sales, it failed miserably because, for the most part it was much easier to just get a gun locally/legally.

> Unless we can educate the people that make these bad decisions not to, and not to fall for ponzie schemes and the like. This does not go away.

People preying on the vulnerable will never go away entirely, but the point is to reduce this behavior.  There's no way to teach people to ""just be smart.""  I don't know you personally, but I can guarantee that you've done some dumb shit that rivals this before...I have too, everyone has and will continue doing so.  You can't get 9 billion people to just be smarter at this point in human evolution.

> It still won't stop one person from buying one unit and reselling it though. The only thing that will is is no one buying ever. Which as my initial comment points out, is extremely unlikely.

This is why you'd need laws...but even if it's one person buying one unit and reselling it that is a drastic reduction in harm from one person buying 20 units and reselling them.",scalper_warning

"Again I am not saying ""every person"" in any way shape or form. Just like when speaking of lower middle class it's wrong to assume that all of them are just lazy good for nothings.

But to assume the only thing in peoples way is themselves is fundamentally incorrect. If only it were that simple then there would not be such issues to discuss.There will always be people bad with money that make enough and put themselves in such situations and they can only blame themselves.

"Educating is not impossible. It's not simple or even easy. Impossible it is absolutely not though. Being vulnerable, and being stupid with money and buying a GPU that is over priced. Are not even in the same realm though. It's not about feeling smart either, its about not making excuses and over using the word victim when it isn't even remotely applicable in this scenario. If you want to apply that term the only thing these folks are ""*victims*"" of, is their own blatant stupidity. They are not overpaying not knowing what the MSRP is and being duped. They are making a purchase knowing it's at inflated pricing. 

Scalpers are indeed predictors, and purchasers are enabling them to take up that role. I don't know who you are referencing, nor how it applies here. Nor am I saying ""*get gud*"", so much as; education is required. Vastly different things. I will not concede at any point that this is anything in the realm of victimization though that's utterly and completely asinine beyond reprieve. 

As a Canadian I find Canadian Law entirely relevant. Beyond that it wa tying in to the web being a global not a strictly American marketplace. As it's not difficult for scalpers to fake their location via VPN and/or use post boxes outside of their locations to skirt laws. 

All it would take is a relative in a country newegg or similar does ship to, to send it off for resale if they cannot get it direct. Or for them to have a post box. Scammers have middle men in the country they are trying to scam in many cases. Assuming no one can get access becasue it's black market now, is also looking through rose coloured glasses. May eliminate some, but illicit and illegal things have been sold since laws were 1st made. Where there's a will, there's a way.

Again there absolutely is a way to educate people to be smart enough not to fall for scams. To deny this is ludicrous. That's defeatist mined BS. People won't stop taking advantage of those they can the only defense is to educate them not to fall for scams. Case in point if you know Africa is a continent and not a country then you would know there is no prince of a continent. Not knowing this and being able to put 2 and 2 together is a failure of a countries education system, as this is basic knowledge. It's certainly not as simple as making 9 billion people smarter over night, education does not work that way. We don't live in the matrix where we can just download knowledge into our heads after all.

Again laws won't stop this, just like laws do not stop drug sales, and prohibition did not stop drinking. At best it would mitigate it some, and likely just further inflate prices due to the increased risk factor. 

All we can do is mitigate and in the long term educate. Which starts with admitting there is a problem, rather than passing the buck and making excuses for it. And I honestly don't see that happening any time soon or at the very least in what remains of my life span. Rather I expect this will stay the same if not get worse. Especially in these times I can't see law makers even finding the time, to discuss such a topic with everything else going on.",scalper_warning
