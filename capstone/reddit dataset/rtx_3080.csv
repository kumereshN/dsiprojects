Has anyone seen 3440x1440 benchmarks anywhere?
Thanks for all of your hard work compiling this!
"So how many people actually changed their minds and decided not to buy after seeing all these reviews? I'm still buying one, but I'm curious if the competition tomorrow has been lessened a bit"
"@op, optimum tech did not get a review card. You can put him off the list, sadly, as he said on Twitter. Would’ve loved his thoughts on the FE"
Anyone of these reviewers checked how the FE cooler affect CPU/RAM temperatures?
RIP my 970. Let's hope tomorrow morning will not be a bloodbath.
"Goodbye, 1060 3gb. You have served me well. Mostly."
Any reviews that showed benchmarks for VR games or games running at an ultrawide resolution?
"People's main complaints seem to be about power consumption and heat, but I've trained. I've lived in the hell of SLI GTX 480s. I'm ready to swap out the 1080 for 3080, this is looking like a worthy upgrade to me for 1440p 144Hz."
"[Techspot had an interesting theory](https://www.techspot.com/review/2099-geforce-rtx-3080/) about the bottlenecking at lower resolutions may not be entirely CPU based, if you were worried about your CPU not being brand new:

> We've looked deeper at the RTX 3080's performance at 1440p, so we want to comment on that. As far as we can tell, CPU bottlenecking alone is not the explanation. The reason comes down to Ampere's architecture and the change to the SM configuration that we mentioned in the introduction. The 2x FP32 design can only be fully utilized at 4K and beyond. This is because at 4K the portion of the render time per frame is heavier on FP32 shaders. At lower resolutions like 1440p, the vertice and triangle load is identical to what we see at 4K, but at the higher resolution pixel shaders and compute effect shaders are more intensive and take longer and therefore can fill the SMs FP32 ALUs better."
Any reviews specific for VR? I wonder how it performs with HP Reverb G2 (pre-production that are out now)
"[Ray Tracing performances](https://babeltechreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RTX-benches.jpg) 

RTX 3000s definitely will be much more mature cards to play games with Raytracing"
"I'm replacing my 1080 Ti, but not with a FE."
"If I had a 2080Ti, I wouldn't go for it, specially if I'm running stock and have overclock headspace. Price to performance wouldn't make sense (specially in Canadian gooses).

Currently though, on a 1080Ti and wanting to get RTX, DLSS, and other fancy schmancy stuff, yeah I'll see if I can grab one."
"Gotta add my man 2kliksphilip 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwX_eKUOyFg"
I am kind of annoyed with the lack of VR benchmarks. Missed opportunity.
Did we just get bamboozled? :D
"Well 10 series owners, we finally have something to move onto!"
"From TPU

>Overclocking on ""Ampere"" seems to be identical to ""Turing"". **The cards will sit in their power limit most of the time, also during overclocking.**

>The Founders Edition has a manual power limit adjustment range of up to 370 W, from a default of 320 W. This can help gain a little bit of extra performance, but it's not a night-and-day difference, **maybe 1% real-life performance.**

Power limit is the enemy. If you want to OC these cards, the AIB 3x pins are probably a must. Expect your clocks to jump around everywhere, increasing the power limit slider will reduce these fluctuations.

https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/images/clocks-and-thermals.png

The FE doesn't look like it has good OC headroom. Your best bet is water-cooling for additional boost clocks (about 15Mhz for every 5-8C you can lower the card if we go off of Turing.). 

I'm excited to see what the AIBs with 3 pins can do once they're in our hands."
any reviews with 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution?  it's at least 15-20% more taxing than regular 1440p from what i hear.
Man they couldn't put some captcha or something to slow down the wave of bots or give hope for humans. I didn't even get to see a change or even know it was over until I came to reddit.
"Hardware Unboxed also uploaded an amazing and detail review. Plus add it to the thread. 

https://youtu.be/csSmiaR3RVE"
Man VR is just completely glazed over this launch cycle. Any VR benchmarks by chance? Having a hard time finding any...
"[https://ibb.co/bdR8WGV](https://ibb.co/bdR8WGV)  
With power limit to 270W 3080 performs 95% as stock. It's pretty good, with undervolt i think it will perform 100% like stock on 270W."
Companies exist that run scripts to immediately put product #s into cart and checkout immediately so they can resell for profits. We never stood a chance lads.
"There’s literally no 1st party place to buy from in USA.

Fire your project manager nvidia..."
"I have a 770 so I'm going to assume I'll get my monies worth in upgrade lol, but my question is should I get the 3080 or the 3070? I don't 4K game, my monitors max is 1080p. Some advise would be much appreciated!"
Looks like I could've kept my 650W PSU for the 3080. Welp.

"Overall, a really great card. Great upgrade if you're still on Pascal.

Coming from a 2080 TI, not sure if I'll upgrade, but the software features are really making me want to. The performance is nice too and roughly what I expected.

EDIT: As some folks below me have mentioned, seems some of the new software features will come to older cards as well so even more reason to stay if you're above a 2060."
RIP to the folks that sold their 2080tis for <$500
I feel so bad for anyone who sold their gpu to get the rtx 3080
i just hope AIBs are equivalent to FE ;(
"Offtopic question: will AIBs make ""fake FE"" cards, with the slick V shaped PCB and that ""weird"" cooler design?"
"Been refreshing since 8:55, never got a slowdown but at 9:04 it flipped to out of stock.  Seems like some mighty trickery going here."
what a sham
"So the overall verdict on preference to coming for the FE is that is pretty decent?

Still trying to decide between FE AND AIB tomorrow"
"I'm still not sure what to do tomorrow. Should I go for a FE or AIB? I know this question has been asked a bunch recently but a lot of the answers were around waiting for benchmarks. Important to note that I'm not too bothered about minuscule upgrades (but if its pretty substantial, then obviously it would make sense). I'm upgrading from a GTX 970 so it's going to be way better regardless"
"Pascalesque upgrade from the RTX 20 series at 4K, but things are a bit mixed for lower resolutions. I thought it was funny how the RTX 3080 was so powerful that it hit the CPU limits in many games at 1440P and below. Truly a beastly 4K card BUT if you're going for very high framerates at 1440P and especially 1080P you should also think about other options like those cheap used 2080Ti or the upcoming 3070 as they could potentially provide better value."
"Out of stock before it loaded, nice"
Did anyone from the US even manage to get one? I don’t see one post or screenshot of someone managing to have gotten it
For me I'm probably going to be keeping my 2070 Super for the time being. The benchmarks are just not as impressive as I thought it would be.
Going from my 1080 to 3080 will be insane.
"The AIBs are nice but damn do they think a lot of them. I'll take my chance on a FE tomorrow. 
Gotta get that 4k60fps for Cyberpunk.
Thanks for all the hard work!"
"does it have a **zero fan mode**?

because that will be the only question that I need answered!!!"
"Basically, if you have a 2080 Ti, you can skip the 3080 as it's not much of an upgrade.

Waiting on the 3090 reviews."
"RTX 3080 1440p FPS  = 1080p FPS of 2080 Ti

FAST BOI"
"It seems that if you have a 2080ti or even a 2080super, I'd wait it out.  Either go all in for a 3090 if you have more funds than patience, or wait to see what the 3080 super (20gb?) Has to offer.  The 3080 will be a nice bump for people on the 1080ti performance level cards."
Am I crazy for wanting to upgrade from a 2080 super?

"Hardware Unboxed has the most sobering review,  though I still think Steve is a little too dismissive of rtx and dlss, and too forgiving of Navi.  He basically calls it a good product with too colorful marketing, and says a large part of any perceived disappointment could be attributed to Digital Foundry and Nvidia,  and not the actual performance itself. 

People really need 4k displays for this card to shine.  Cpus are too slow at the moment and rtx and dlss are only slightly improved."
Gonna be a real nice upgrade from my GTX 1080 and my 1440p 165hz monitor. Glad to see the cooler is great too. Nice.
"Thats the end of the road of my 1050 ti. 3080, here i come!!!!"
"This looks exciting, who's disappointed can just don't buy it so there will be more in stock for us.

Tomorrow is gonna be the big day!"
"As expected, very good gains, just not as good as the slides made people believe, this is very similar to Pascal against Maxwell - ""1070 faster than Titan X"" - yes, right, in a few titles with some details at some resolutions.

It's an amazing GPU nonetheless.

Kudos for the Founder Edition, amazing performance considering the 300W+ power consumption."
"Coming from a 1080 that isn't making it for ultrawide 100+hz, I'll be going 3080 for sure. However I will not be going FE, I'll be going MSI or Asus like I always do. I'm all about noise reduction and they typically have the best db vs. performance ratios."
"Hey guys, I have a 1080ti and am looking to upgrade alongside ryzen 4 when it drops. 

I have enough saved to get a 3090 (at the proposed price) but I'm beginning to feel more and more that a 3080 will be enough.

Especially as it will be purely be for gaming and not streaming or rendering. 

Am i right that the difference for me likely wont be worth the extra money or are we still a bit in the dark about it?"
"So if we want to OC and Watercool, don't go FE is what I'm hearing?"
"Great benchmark scores.

It's all down to whether Nvidia have enforced a hard power limit on the AIB partners.

There's barely any headroom on the FE for overclocking. If it's the same on the AIBs, then those 3x8 pin models are absurd as they'll offer no benefit at all."
"Now we probably know why they priced these cards so aggressively. I think the AMD cards are going to be very competitive. I mean, the price is amazing, putting 2080Ti to shame, but if you have a 2080Ti, I see no reason to sell it for a 3080. 

900 and 1000 series owners will probably buy it though, but I think they should wait to see AMD performance, before buying."
"So 3600 and 3080 should definitely be fine with a decent 600W PSU, right? Probably gonna avoid overclocking ofc."
"Guru3d has reviews of the Asus Tuf, MSI trio, and Palit.
Includes thermals."
"This looks impressive but it's definitely not the card it was touted out to be. The power consumption is pretty disappointing. 

AMD, please deliver."
"I know this is going to sound salty and I know influencers getting cards early is not even a drop in the supply bucket but its super irritating that so many shit tier youtubers get these cards in advance while half of us probably wont be able to grab one for months due to ""supply shortages"".

I mean we have people who average like 1k views a video dropping reviews on this thing where they're pairing it with CPU's from like 15 years ago. Where is the value in that?"
"I'm very surprised the FE cooler turns out to be.. not garbage at all. Considering it's looks and compact size vs AIB's, that's the one I'll try first tomorrow."
yeet
"As expected the performance difference is around 80% at 4k. Performance difference is smaller at lower resolutions but still big. It's around 70% at 1440p. Performance difference gets even bigger when RT enabled.

&#x200B;

Essentially you are getting twice performance for the same money. Additionally cooler is much better if you don't have custom loop."
"Starting to see signs of CPU bottlenecks at 1440p - I wonder how many future games this will effect. You would think the newer, flashier GPU settings will alleviate this, but I wonder.

"Bizzare responses.
Am i seriously reading about so many people wanting to upgrade from 2080ti and now they won't after seeing the numbers that are pretty much the numbers everyone expected? This can't be real."
">	no Anandtech review

Might as well not even bother putting one out if you aren’t going to have it ready for today. Super disappointing since Anand is one of my main sources for reviews."
"What absolutely looks l
Clear based on numbers seen from testers using ryzen vs Intel is that Intel is the only chip getting the absolute most out of your card. Heck even 2080ti owners have been leaving up to 20 fps on the floor ."
"""The 3080 will provide the same performance as the 2080 TI""

Reddit: This will be a crazy good deal!!

~~~~ Reviews drop ~~~~

""The 3080 is about 20% faster than the 2080 TI""

Reddit: Wow, this was so overhyped"
Any reviews make a mention of AI/ML performance? Tensor core performance ∆ compared to a 2080 Super is what I'm most interested in.
anyone done VRAM benchmark yet ?
TechPowerUp's review states that undervolting isnt possible! IS this because Afterburner hasnt been updated or is it locked off entirely? Would the AIB cards be able to be undervolted?
"I can't find a single video that actually goes into the fan noise and how loud the card is and compared to other cards that are actually in depth.  One of my greatest issues is fan noise, I can't hear my EVGA 1080 ti sc2 at full load at all.

I can't find a video of the card at full load so I can hear it, I can't find much information at all and there isn't much about how it affects cpu temps but what I can find it doesn't affect more than a few degrees.

Does anyone know where there is some decent info on noise?  I was hoping Gamer Nexus would have more, he even got straight into it first thing but I was underwhelmed by lack of info although he will probably post another video at a later date."
Nice upgrade over my 1080. Now to see if I can actually snagged one up...
"Any idea when is the AIB embargo date?

Really wanted to see how the MSI Ventus holds up against the others."
After seeing the numbers... Navi better deliver cause this gen would be even worse than the last one.
Anybody seen any reviews having done compatibility testing of hdmi 2.1 VRR 4k@120Hz HDR with any/some/main/all hdmi 2.1 4k TVs?
"This is what I what I expected performance wise at 1440p having a 2080. I was not planning to upgrade it yet but the results are promising. However, I'd rather invest in increasing my resolution with a new main monitor within the next year and upgrade on the next refresh to properly take advantage of the performance improvements and gain in visual quality/experience by going ultrawide for example."
Thank you Nvidia for making it worth waiting 5 months to build my pc.
"Off-topic question but; Nvidia will start selling FE cards at 6 am pacific, right? So I don't have to stay up for all night and spam F5.

I know this is a dumb question but I've never built a PC or buy any graphics card before so I really need to know this."
"Well, my dear 980 SC it's time. You were the first GPU I ever had and I was lucky to have you. We've lasted a good six years together. I can't resist the call of the new cards. These look great. Now I just have to decide which one. I'm leaning on MSI, EVGA, or Founder's personally."
Has anyone benchmarked with various CPUs? Wondering how badly my 6700k will bottleneck at 1440p.
I’m assuming the timeline for the 3090 reviews will be the same as these. So reviews on the 23rd and on sale on the 24th? Is that fair to assume?
Did anyone mention what kind of fan bearings the 3080 FE uses?
"Pretty underwhelming IMO.  Way better deal for those in the market now than I was when I got back into desktop PCs. Reviews generally nailed it:  worthwhile cards.  Since I am pleased enough with where I am at I will hold out for the next gen, hopefully on a TSMC process(or whoever the fab-master is at that time).  Its not enough of an upgrade for my 1440p uses to justify the cash outlay or the hassle of draining the loop even."
"The 1440p benchmarks bode well for me, coming from a 1080 Ti. Wouldn't upgrade from anything above a 2080 if that was my case, simply because of how much money I would lose. 

I don't expect the 3070 to be truly better than the 2080 Ti in anything besides full raytraced games like Minecraft."
" I have to say, I'm surprised to hear bitwit recommend that a 550W PSU may be enough for this card. Granted, the power draw in his review was below 550W, but many users will have additional peripherals plugged into their systems; HDDs, SSDs, keyboard, mouse, etc. and that will likely put you beyond the capabilities of a 550W PSU. I'd recommend at least a 650W unit, but 750W is probably the better choice to provide a safe amount of headroom."
I guess I'll finally get rid of my [AMD 7970 GHz Edition](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-hd-7970-toxic-6-gb/).  Hopefully I'll see an improvement :)
Upgrading from RX 480! It was a great card and will always be remembered.
"I'm not here for gaming but is anyone else excited for rendering performance? techgage shows the 3080 beating the 2080ti by cutting renderings times in almost half. 4 years ago, I was doing renders with 6 1080ti's and sold them off slowly with the last one getting 500 dollars a couple months ago. It seems like with ray tracing and optiX, one 3080 is going to beat my render times with 6 1080ti's."
I haven't noticed in the reviews I've seen so far but does the fan on the 3080FE shut off at idle?
Are NVIDIA and Best Buy the only two places selling FE?
" i dont know if this question has been asked and answered, but how are people on ebay already have confirmed pre-orders and there's like already 40 cards sold? there's no pre-orders at all for the 3000's right?"
"Will I be bottlenecked by my CPU if I am gaming at 1440p?

I have a GTX 1080 and an i7-700k with 16 gb ram (3200 mHz) and 1 TB SSD and I have an Acer Predator monitor that runs at 165hz overclocked."
"Never changed from ""notify me"" did they even post em?"
Well everything went from coming soon to sold out before I had a chance to press anything. Didn't even get the false hope of it pretending to load a 3080 into my cart. Anyone have any idea how long it is before round 2 comes out?
"Got my order through 15 seconds after they launched, hopefully i was quick enough.."
[How life goes](https://i.imgur.com/zomqg2j.png)
"Overall I'm still pretty impressed with the performance. A little disappointing to me that so many reviewers/consumers (especially LTT and they had to add a *disclaimer in the video) are stuck on ""2x the performance of the 2080!"" when in reality it was ""UP TO 2x the performance of the 2080"" and with a little common sense with how companies like to advertise products means in very very specific scenarios will you actually see a 100% performance increase. I feel the circle of people I just described are the same people that get baited in by all the ""Interest rate AS LOW AS ___%"" and get mad when they dont qualify for the rock bottom rate with a credit score in the 500s

Regardless I'm pleased! Especially with the fan noise/temps. I'm sure it'll be even better in an actual tower with optimized airflow vs an open bench where hopefully the design to have ~50% of the hot air pushed out the back vs 100% into the case is more apparent.

Big thanks to you guys for putting all this together!"
***ARE WE GETTING A NEW NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVER TODAY?!***
Amazing results.  Can't wait to get my hands on one of these and the 3090.
"Does anyone know if NZXT or ibuypower will be offering these in their custom builds starting tomorrow?



Wife gave me the go ahead to get a new $3000+ rig so I'm gonna go all out including one of these bad boys."
I'll still be upgrading from my 1080ti. I think I'm right on the edge for it being a worthwhile upgrade - anything better in the 20-series lineup would probably not be imo.
Cards are on eBay for $1400+ with dozens of bids
Where can I find information as to when they release tomorrow? Would like to order mine online asap.
Well this just solidifies my decision to finally upgrade from my 1080Ti.
"most games gains between 40 and 100fps compared to a 1080ti at 1440p so not too bad, my only concern is the temperature which seems kinda high especially since this new cooler was supposed to be a lot better but we'll see how the aibs will perform"
"You son of a bitch, I'm in!"
DId any outlet measure the exact dimension of the card? Especially its width? edit: its 3.8cm
[deleted]
"There are some excellent reviews out there, but all of them are severely lacking from what I can see. Nvidia is pushing ML, and that's supposed to be the big thing with Ampere. Still, none of the reviews I can find even touches the subject of ML performance. :("
"So I‘m currently running a 1080 OC with a 1440p Monitor (CPU: i7-7700K). Not planning to get a 4k for at least the next two years. Pretty happy with 1440p at the moment.

Playing mostly Flightsims (getting stable 25 to 35 fps on high in MSFS 2020 atm), racing sims and some shooters. 

Question for all who are better hardware pros than I will ever be: is it worth to buy the 3080 or better to go for a 2080 Super OC for a good price? (seems to me that the prices for the not FEs are going up in Germany tomorrow and the following days)"
Has anyone seen a benchmark with Fallout 4 yet or 1440p ultrawide numbers?
"Worth upgrading a 2070 (non super) for 1440p 144Hz and 4k 60?

Currently on a 9600k and 650W PSU"
"Going from a 2070 Super, I am going to get it on the basis that I'm going to a dual monitor setup. Really disappointed in the Microsoft Flight Sim performance, but that's down to MSFS being poorly optimized and being tied to CPU performance. Hopefully their upcoming patch takes more advantage of the GPU"
"So hypothetically, if AMD Big Navi isn't in between 3070 and 3080 performance for roughly the cost of a 3070, Big Navi is dead in the water?"
"So, people who sold their 2080 Ti cards with a good value, are you going 3080 or 3090 for 1440p gaming? Still need to see what AIBs are gonna do with overclocking etc. but still in dilemma."
Forbes [https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2020/09/16/nvidia-rtx-3080-review-just-how-fast-is-it/#56ba3148421c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2020/09/16/nvidia-rtx-3080-review-just-how-fast-is-it/#56ba3148421c)
Should we wait for non founders? What's the consensus?
"Why did Anandtech not do a review, did they not a GPU ?"
4k or 1440 monitor... the upgrade is apparently much more worth it at 4k. Hmm.
"Not that great imo, though I am still looking to get one to replace the old 980ti.  

&#x200B;

Performance increases but so does power consumption.  I think that's the biggest disappointment for me honestly is the power hunger (Samsung 8nm problems).  Bigger uplift in rtx performance will likely play in to longevity.

&#x200B;

This generation only looks good because of how bad the 2000 series was price and performance wise."
"Currently on a 1080Ti, looks like a massive leap in performance. I still only have a 6700k though, but I have it clocked at 4.5GHz and I play at 1440p144hz so hopefully it doesn't hold me back too much."
"On RAM size, doesn't the Ampere series offer a new feature of I/O optimization that means you don't need as much video RAM as before?"
So when is Reflex being released? I have only watched LTT's review so far and he mentions it will be released today...but I cant find anything for it other than the announcement and its page on nvidia's site but no download links. Am I just too early?
"Phew, looking at the FPS increase in games from a GTX 1080 to a 3080 is big. I can't wait!"
Does a PCIE 4.0 SSD on an AMD Ryzen 3000 series + processor improve these scores or was that tested by one of these reviews?
So long R9 390!!
"Going to be a spendy week. New Apple Watch purchased already and now a new GPU, if all goes as planned."
Anyone come across WoW: Shadowlands benchmarks? This should be benchmarked considering its releasing roughly the same time as the 3k series...
I wish they'd lift the 3090 embargo as well. I'm debating between the 3080 and 3090 and am curious how much of a boost itd give exactly.
"I asked this in another subreddit already but i'll ask it agian

 Is it okay if i use 1 PCIe 6+2 cable and daisy chain with the other one? I'm asking because almost all third party GPUs use 3x8 pin connectors and my psu only has 2 6+2 PCIe connectors. My PSU is a Corsair RM750i"
"Well damn, the founders edition looks *really* nice right now. I've never bought a founders edition card, but how much performance improvement can there really be with the AIB cards?"
Ive watched some reviews but can anyone tell me if my i5-8600k will bottleneck a 3080?
"I don't all watch videos and read articles. Watched GN (the methodology guy), HU (the game benchmark guy), DF (the Crisis guy, but see below), Paul (the decent and wise guy), and Kyle (love the fact that he used 3600XT), Dave Lee (showing his Ghost build and failure to run with 600W PSU with 10900K) then also go through the Guru 3D (recommending 650 W PSU) and TechPowerUp (undervolt/overclock explanations).


But I really like Digital Foundry reviews overall, every minutes of Richard explanations were really useful, he also tries to give the big picture (type of games according to the extent of improvement) and scenario to scenario analysis (what is limiting the performance, and if you have Turing or Pascal at the moment). I agree with their statement when they mention ""Brute Force Power"".


My take away:
I am OK with the RTX3080 performance (so, still impressive, esp. that 4K performance) and definitely offers a lot of value now buying GPU at 700USD range for the performance it can offer especially considering how crazy it was with the high end of the the RTX20-series but at the same time I am disappointed about the power figures (performance/watt). After checking further, sadly there is no way to undervolt RTX3080 (TechPowerUp). Probably this is the best way to upgrade if you are with Pascal card now and having the budget and headroom (thermal, power), but even more conditional if you are with Turing now."

I still do not get the thing about the 12-pin connector. Is the adapter necessary? Can't you just use two cables if you don't care about cable management or just prettier looks?
"It seems the fastest gamer CPU (Intel 10900) is bottlenecking the 3080 in FHD.

Waiting for faster CPUs."
Has anyone seen any hashcat benchmarks?
did any of them test on warzone? i clicked a couple and couldn't fin any cod benchmarks...some of those games they tested you don't even benefit from having high fps.
How hard is it gonna be to grab one tomorrow if I'm sitting at my pc? Near impossible? Doable but gotta be quick? 15 minute window?
Best place to get MSI gaming trio on launch day?
"I really like how Digital Foundry focused on pascal comparisons. Coming from a 1070, I’m so excited."
Just take my money
Amazing card! But It doesn't make sense to upgrade if I'm currently playing on 1440p with an OC'd AIB 2080ti. Perhaps the 3080ti will make me jump.
Such a shame that the FE is limited by power limit and can't be overclocked further... Since the temp is only around 75C on full load.
"I get it's the optimal comparison, but it bothers me so many reviewers completely slipped comparing this against 10 series cards.

I get you can extrapolate amounts by figuring out the difference between the 10 and 20 series cards then go from there, but it feels like a wasted opportunity.

Turing sold like ass. Nvidia even acknowledged this. These articles should be about convincing 10 series buyers to make the plunge into the 30 series cards. Instead it's all just trying to combat nvidia marketing. ""Is it actually 2x the speed of a 2080! Let's find out!"""
"So guys , what should I do? Keep an ASUS ROG Strix non OC version or try to buy a founders for 90€ less? I would really like to overclock the shit out of this card."
"What I'm getting from this is, upgrading from my 1070 is going to be great."
"I'm wondering if I should go for an AIB and keep the H500i that I have, with somewhat restricted airflow, or buy an FE and a new case with better airflow. I'd probably for the FTW3 Ultra, which would barely fit in my current case"
I want to add [this review](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2020/09/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review/) that have some nice pictures of the pcb and benchmarks.
"I'm still conflicted.
I have a GTX 980 and have been waiting to upgrade. 
I want the best for VR but I dunno what to choose.
Do I spend more for a 3090? Do I wait for Ti versions?
Wait for AMD to see how their value is?
I just want a more stable and smooth VR experience =["
"Haven't read all the reviews in detail but it looks like the benefits are very good for higher resolutions than 1080p. Ofc this is comparing the cards to the older gen 1xxx series and before that. But if you're still stuck on 1080p and you have the 2xxx series, it wouldn't be as compelling to upgrade to the 3xxx series. The only thing I'm seeing that doesn't really benefit at all is if you have the 2080ti and you're still gaming on 1080p, which has very little benefits.

&#x200B;

In my case, I may plan to upgrade to maybe a 3070 only because I currently have a 2060 and testing MS Flight Simulator is actually the only game that struggled with it. For everybody else, this card should be future proof for any 1080p gaming and a very nice bump if you did want to go 1440p or higher in the future."
yo. is the 3080 gonna get bottlenecked by a 6700k playing at 1440p? gamernexus' video makes it seem this way.
Anandtech really needs to hire people that can put out reviews on time. They had an extra 2 days from original date . everyone else got theirs done.  They had the same issue last gen
"stock cooler seems pretty good, wonder how much cooler the others will run"
"Running a 2070s right now. I rotate two monitors currently, 1080p 144hz and 1440 144hz. 

My problem is that even on the 1080p, games like RDR2 don't get over 70ish fps 100% of the time. Goal is highest noticeable settings and highest possible frame rate. 

Considering the upgrade."
Worth upgrading a 2080 Super for this?  I play at 1440p 144.
I'm having a real hard time deciding between MSI or FE
So on the fence ordering tomorrow.  I have a 2080 right now with a 1440p monitor and every non VR game I throw at it it works fine.  But I have a Hp reverb G2 on order which is basically 4K between both eyes.  So the 3080 will definitely be an improvement for it...  but how much of an improvement...
If I don't get one tomorrow I'll wait to see how the 3079 preforms. I'm most likely to get that since I've had a 970/1070/2070
"So I'm on a GTX970 running on a 1080p 1920x1080 Asus VS24H 60Hz monitor. I'm going to assume that the 3070 will be more than enough? (i7-6700k 4Ghz, 32GB DDR4, Samsung EVO SSDs)"
Goodbye RTX 2060 it was a good year but your time has come.
"I'm stuck at work and can't watch the videos.

Would anyone that watched a few be able to tell me how are the thermals? I usually care more about that vs fps.  What I mean is if I can game around 60-65c I would gladly pay for that vs getting 10 fps more when I'm already at 100+ fps.  

My hope is that this card is avg 70c and the evga hybrid at 60c.  


Thanks"
Well the hype has died down.. but to more realistic expectations. I own a 1060 6GB and I'll still be picking one up and completing my new build and letting it stay that way for years to come.
"So, based on this release and Nvidia's past releases, how much of an improvement can we expect from the 3080ti version?"
"This looks awesome! I'm in two minds though about what route to go down, I have a 7700k overclocked to 4.9 and I game at 1440p with a 1080ti. I stream too and I want to have the best quality streaming I can especially with a game like Cyberpunk coming out, would a 3080 be ok or should I just spend that bit more and get a 3090? I will at some point in the next 6 months be building a completely new rig depending on zen 3/next gen intel."
Buying this tomorrow hopefully. Excited!

This list looks actually pretty complete to me."
"I reckon I'm at the perfect point here, with a 1070 gaming x and a uwqhd monitor this thing is gonna steam through my games library.

Fingers crossed for tomorrow!"
Why is there no comparison between FE and AIB yet?
"Thank you for compiling all of this data. You are awesome! 

As a 980ti owner, this upgrade will make me really happy :) Recently upgraded my CPU to Ryzen 3700 too, this should be a really nice combo for my 2560x1440p monitor."
"Just curious, but have there been any AIB model reviews yet? I know the FE is probably the best bang for the buck, but in the case that the FE is sold out I'd like to see more info for the AIB models."
"So PC Gamer is quite the outlier.

\+50% @ 1440P over 2080Ti."
What time of day do orders begin tomorrow? Cant find a shred of info anywhere on this.
Any reviewers play on LG C9 with 4K 120HZ?
"If I make the move to game exclusively on an OLED I'll buy it. 4K gaming is beautiful, but high refresh rate 1080p and 1440p will be fine with a GTX 1080 for the time being."
"I'm sorry if this was already answered but I can't seem to find it in any of the previous threads:

Is there going to be a per customer limit on the 3080 tomorrow morning? Or is NVIDIA going to allow all of the 3P sellers with their bots to scoop them all up in the first 2 seconds?"
i'm scared for my 6700k
[deleted]
"So the biggest difference is at 4K and synthetic/heavy processing workloads. For most of us, we may need to buy a TV/monitor that can push higher resolution and framerates. 🤷‍♂️

But most are using 1080p and 1440p, and the value starts fading when comparing a 2080ti and a 3080. The difference in FPS is something to mention, but above 120fps most users will not really be able to benefit from the gains. 🤔

Sure, more frames are great and it can make a difference in more series competitive gameplay. But after a certain point it is performance that is almost purely for personal satisfaction and tricky to tell the difference. 😔"
Anyone have a mathematical model to predict the 3090 performance using the 3080 benchmarks as a starting point? I’d really like to hit 4k120 for use with my LG OLED C9 but it looks like the 3080 won’t hit that. I typically play Fortnite with my kids using a 2080 Super and hit 120+ consistently using ultra settings at 1440p.
Currently running a 4790k with a 2060FE. I'm upgrading my whole rig and I'm definitely in for the 3080. I have a 3440x1440p monitor so just need to wait on the new Ryzen Cpus before its complete. I'm super Psyched! Hope all who are after one manage to snag one on release :)
"Are FEs limited stock? As in, eventually they stop selling them? If so how long until they stopped selling 20XX FEs?"
"I'm mostly upgrading to get access to HDMI 2.1 to make full use of my LG C9 so I can output 4k/120hz/HDR/4:4:4/12bit

That being said it still seems like a well worthwhile upgrade from a 1080, albeit not quite as notable a performance gain in all scenarios"
[deleted]
"I have a 1080ti and playing at 1440p at 165Hz and I am on the fence. The games I currently am playing don't really require me to upgrade but it will be nice to have for the next few years.

I have a 8700k cpu so I don't think bottlenecking will be an issue. Bitwit tested the 3080 with a Ryzen 3600 and it performed well. But if I do end up choosing to upgrade, I would at least wait for the Ryzen Zen 3 cpus and build a new system around that.

I would not be looking forward to the power consumption..."
Coil whine/noises seem to be really common for FE which. I find that unacceptable for a card and I really wouldn't like to buy a card that has a high chance for coil whine. Other than that the FE seems really nice (but damn that power use...).
"For a novice trying to figure things out, is there a reason to get OC versions of this 3080 as opposed to the normal versions? For example, I see the ASUS ROG STRIX 3080 in both regular and OC versions...what's the difference and real benefit here?"
"ok now we have enough information on the rtx 3080 to form our own opinions. now what we need are AIB LEAKS BEFORE TOMORROW. COME ON, AIB OWNERS. DO US ALL A FAVOR"
Has any reviewers confirmed the SR-IOV is enabled on these cards?
"based on tomshardware.com, our quad cores are fucked, even at 1440p. my poor 6700k. fuck, i don't know what i'm gonna do now. i have less than 24 hours to decide.

"Bitwit seems to think 3600 is fine for 3080.

I have gone from thinking Ill need 3090 to 3080, and now I might not need a zen 3 and theres no reason for me to get a NVME ssd like I was just about to ( I thought rtx io was coming out with the 3000 series at launch ). Looks like ill be getting a ps5 after all, and having lots left over. Had $3500 AUD saved for all this, looking at $1600 now."
"Maybe a silly question but Nvidia hasn't released drivers yet, right? These game benchmarks may as well improve with some driver tweaking down the line."
"How long does it typically take for a super or TI version to come out for these cards?
Also for AIB would it be better to wait for the second generation with better coolers?"
Are there speed charts for aftermarkets anywhere? I could have sworn I saw the MSI Gaming X running at 1815 instead of 1700 but I can't find again where ever I saw that.
Anyone know what is the very best AIB (non watercooled) under 310mm ?
"Want one, but don't want to deal with ordering an AIB without reviews being out."
"Did anyone see a reviewer test warzone? That game runs like shit on my 1080 at 1440p

"Has anyone else noticed huge differences in temperatures and noise levels from reviewer to reviewer?

&#x200B;

Edit: and if anyone has a link to a review that talks about overclocking (other than GN)  I'd appreciate it"
"Can't take an in depth look at the reviews right now as I'm at work.

Planning to upgrade to the 3080, coming from a 970. I have an i5 9600k. Will my CPU be okay with the 3080 at 1440p? Planning to upgrade my CPU/MOBO next year but want to make sure it won't cause any major issues until then."
Annoying the details for the AIB's won't be out until tomorrow. I want to get the founders atm but if I can't I don't know what the best cheap alternative AIB card would be. Can see myself missing out for a while if I can't get the founders because I don't want to order a bad AIB card.
Anyone know a review that tested Warzone at 4K?
"Probably gonna upgrade this year to a 3080, coming from a 1080ti... actually impressed by the undervolting... roughly 50w less for the same performance and a stable 1800mhz clock."
"Any 2080TI sli vs 3080 or 2070S sli vs 3080?

I saw the 4k results for the 3080 I'm not very impressed as we still struggle to run 4k in 2020.

 I think my best bet is to purchase 3090 ×2 and hope for 144fps at 4k ultra.

I know I could just lower the settings which js more practical and I'm on the fence about upgrading 2070S to 3080"
Remember remember the 17th of September.
You've beenn good 980 ti.
"Unless AMD has anything better, going to upgrade from a GTX 980 🤣"
"Man I got a question and I hope this gets seen by someone:

I currently have an i5 9400f and I'm gonna get this GPU asap (if not sold out lol), but what should CPU should I replace my 9400f with? Its an LGA 1151 socket. Anytime I ask on PCMR, I get a bunch of condescending answers that don't help at all. Anyone got any knowledge to drop on me?"
Anyone come across any deep learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow) benchmarks so far?
"any memory tests on 4k? does it reach its limits with ""only"" 10gb?"
"I have a Titan X (pascal), would it be worth it to upgrade to a 3080?"
"I was thinking of selling my old one to get a 3080 but I think i'm just gonna wait until the next series. It's a great card, but I think I don't think it's justified selling a 2080S and going through the process of trying to get my hands on one"
When will AIB reviews come out?
"Should I get a RTX 3080? Or keep the RTX 2070?

POWER: Shark WPM Gold Zero 750W

"Still can’t decide if it’s worth upgrading from my 1080ti, with an i7-7700k from Hardware Canucks specs it seems like the cpu will bottleneck and it won’t be that much of an improvement"
[deleted]
"Super excited to see the good reviews and performance increases, but it does look like the bump from 2080ti to 3080 may not be that huge. These benchmarks are making me kinda lean towards splurging on the 3090."
I'm currently using an OCZ ModXStream Pro 600w power supply that I've used since 2012 and have a secondary Corsair CX600M power supply (green label) that was never really used. Will either of these two be able to power a Ryzen 7 3700x and RTX 3080 at stock?
[deleted]
"So what I was most interested in was knowing if the cooler was any good on the FE. It obviously seems pretty good and an improvement over previous FEs, but reviewers don't seem to mention how it compares to previous third party solutions?

Do we know if the FE is good even compared to third party solutions?"
If its still a 83% increase from my 2070s then 3080 here i come!
Why no 2060s % comparison ? :/
"I am not very tech savy anymore these days, and I was wondering if someone could offer some advice.  Based on reviews I am seeing that at lower resolutions and lower CPUs the 3080 suffers a bit in comparison...

For someone with a i5-4670 and a 970 right now who only has a 1080 monitor... is  there any reason to upgrade to a 3080 tomorrow?  I plan to eventually piece-meal upgrade my system but it would be christmas at the earliest that I would have a new cpu/mobo and monitor and gpu."
So 6am PST? @ Nvidia.com?
When does the 3090 embargo lift?
"So if I am looking at this correctly, nvidia does not have a set your address and preferred payment option on their website?

Its going to be an absolute bloodbath."
"Which AIBs are known to be pretty reliable for Nvidia cards? As far as quality, cooling, and customer service. I guess top 5 AIBs to be looking out for tomorrow?"
"For someone like me with a 3840x1080 monitor, should I be looking at 1440p benchmarks to get an idea of performance? I was previously using a 35"" 1440p ultrawide which technically had more total pixels compared to my Samsung."
"Think I'm getting one of these.  Going to wait to see AIB reviews and lick my favorite amongst that crowd, but the numbers look good."
"MSI Trio was available for me on newegg for like 30 seconds, was gone immediately"
Is there a review that take a look at RT performance improvement compare to 2000 series ? I want to see how much better it is compared to the performance lost when it's used.
I just hope rtx 3070 has 2080ti performance !! I am going upgrade my monitor to 1440p 144hz and my gtx 1660 super isn't going to cut it.
"As someone who's been using a really out-dated, but wonderful QNIX 2710 27inch monitor that has never had a single issue in the past 6 years that I've used it -  and currently has a gtx 1070, playing on 1440 resolution

Would it be beneficial for me to replace my whole monitor and get the RTX 3080, or should i just sell my 1070 and get a 1080ti EVGA B-stock, so that I'm still able to use my DVI monitor a few more years?"
Does anyone know if Afterburner will be able to control the 3 fans on an evga xc3? It only controls one fan on my 1080ti SC2. Ideally moving the fans speed slider in afterburner would change all 3 fans. If not I may have to get an FE.
Is anyone going try order direct from Nvidia or are people just straight up giving up on it?
anyone know if i can plug in my cable extensions into the 12 pin connector? or will i have to use the PCIE cables straight from the psu? :)
If I want an FE should I buy via nvidia or best buy? Who's got better shipping?
3kliksphilip is popular enough now to get review products?
"Now that benchmarks are out, on average the 3080 seems to be 25-30% faster than a 2080 Ti, and the ""up to 2x 2080"" has a big asterisk on it (only in a couple games, and usually RTX/DLSS has to be on).

Based on CUDA core count, the 3080 has 48% more CUDA cores than the 3070. Do we really think the 3070 will beat the 2080 Ti across the board? I am not seeing it.

I predict the 3070 will be 10% slower than the 2080 Ti in most titles, only surpassing it in RTX titles and maybe Doom.

&#x200B;

Also, the 3090 only has 21% more CUDA cores than the 3080. Are we about to see only a 10-15% performance increase on a $1500 GPU vs $700?"
When do the AIB review come out?
What is the general consensus on the 3080 10gb of vram now? No issue?

"I definitely want a 30xx series card, but I'm thorn between a 3070 and 3080. Even more than that, I'm thorn between a FE and AIBs T\_T. The FE looks the best by far, but who knows how it will stack against the rest when it comes to pricing and performance."
Won't all these benchmarks improve once the right drivers come out?
Anyone know if it's a bad idea to upgrade if i have a 1080 and Ryzen 2600x?
What are the chances of getting one of these in a month or so?
"I'm sure this question is being asked non stop in the various threads but I thought I'd ask it again.

Looking at the specs of the AIM cards that are now up on the various store websites, looks like they bump up the clock from 1.7 to 1.75 and 1.8 depending on price.  I saw wattage listed at 750 for EVGA.  I'm sure there are other details I've missed.  Prices are also higher for AIM (by about $200 canadian)

I'm not an overclocker and noise and heat matter to me.  I am leaning towards FE if I can get my hands on one, but thought I'd do a last minute census."
Nothing posted?

"Is there any benchmark with TW Warhammer 2? The usual woe, they never test with the games that I play :D"
Why are all the cards that I see the old designs? I don't see any with the newer cooling design they showed off. Even on EVGA's website they old sold the older style design?
"Yeah, I feel like an absolute jackass for selling my 2080Ti. This is essentially the same card, just cheaper."
"The fact that people are disappointed makes me insanely happy, means that theres more chance for me get a 3080 at launch. Going from a 2070s to 3080 for around 350 extra as i flipped my card is very  much worth it."
These reviews have me droolin
"Looks like no nasty surprises, bring on the launch!"
"In summary, it's good."
"Looks very impressive over all.

The review by Linus was the first time I heard about this miscommunication concerning SR-IOV and, being someone who'd benefit from that on consumer cards, it was a bit of a rollercoaster between getting excited and crashing down back to reality once it truned out that this was in fact just a misunderstanding.

I know that it is very unlikely, especially considering the number of people who'd benefit from SR-IOV support is tiny, though I'd still love to see Nvidia enable this funcitionality for regular users. Even just a limited, highly restricted implementation to not canibalize Quadro/Tesla sales would be appreciated.

They could go so far as to lock this down to only being able to ""split"" the GPU once, the ability to continue running the host system without the need to stop the display manager while using a guest would be greatly appreciated by those who, due to space constraints (ITX builds, rack mounted servers with limited PCIe slotes) and because their CPU has no graphics unit included are currently unable to passthrough their GPU without disabling the display manager.

I get that this is very unlikely, almost impossible, but one can always hope."
this card is soo effing good for rendering. damn.
Gamers nexus didn’t show a big improvement in OC. So 3080 seems plenty good for 1440p.

Don't get me wrong I'm still upgrading this generation (still running an rx 580). I'll just wait and see how the 3070 winds up and then choose between the 3070/3080"
Has anyone benchmarked it against a 970? Would love to see what gains I'm about to get.
"No question about buying the 3080. Moving from a 980 SLI setup will be an incredible change, especially at 4K, something I had to compromise on many games from 2014-2017 and can't play above 1440p nowadays"
too much text.
Any review that look into vram limitations? I feel like a card 60 to 80% faster only getting 25% more ram is going to be an issue. Considering the 1080ti had more vram for the same price 4 year ago.
"seems VERY bad in flight sim, maybe because of low VRAM?"
"2080ti owner, happy to sit out this gen"
"Any good review/benchmark that looked at 3080 Vs 2070 (non super) at 1440?
It seems a lot of 2070 super users are on the fence, and the difference between 2070 and 2070 super isn't that big anyway... I was pretty set on trying to get a 3080 FE tomorrow, but if all I'll be getting is a 20% jump I think I might skip this circle and wait for TI's...

"TBH I think Nvidia just fucked all the AIB cards big time.

AIBs with their old school, boring, unappealing designs... which cost MORE than nvidia's card? LOL.

Gotta say nvidia came out and hit a grand slam with this one im sure many AIBs are sweatin."
"For those who currently have a turing, especially a 2090 Ti like myself, I think the results show it’s worth waiting. 

AMD is going to come out and may get close to 3080 but likely with much less power draw. 

If that is the case then 2080Ti owners might be better off going AMD This gen (sin for team green for lifers like me I know I know) OR waiting for the NVDA response.

And believe me NVDA will have a response. Did we get Tis yet? Nope. Supers? Nope. 

Patience may pay off here."
Anyone with 550W PSU still going for 3080?
"Any fortnite benchmarks out there yet? I guess I'll wait for the RTX update as that will be a major factor in if I decide to move from my 2070 Super or not.

I swear you guys downvote anything. I'm aiming for 1440p and 240fps with settings higher than low. My bad for enjoying something, sheesh."
Any info on performance improvement from 2080 Super to 3080?
[deleted]
"Nice performance upgrade, but like [computerbase.de](https://computerbase.de) showed, it's about the same compared between Maxwell and Pascal. Really good but that's how it should be. In my opinion the $699 for the 3080 is fair, but the $499 for the upcoming 3070 is too expensive. It's the same like RTX 2070 and that was alredy too much. I'm aware we talking about RTX cards with additional Tensor and RT cores, but that should be a point for the first gen (early adopters), but not anymore on the second one. It's called technical progress and even new consoles/RNDA2 getting dedicated Raytracing hardware (although it seems not on the level of Nvidia) show it's slowly becoming mainstream.

Last generations had the x70 normally at $349-$399 price range and another ""bad aftertaste"" is it having 8GB VRAM (and normal GDDR6). That means 8GB for the third time and this can quickly become more of a bottleneck for 4K than the raw GPU power of the card (now knowing the performance of the 3080 we can estimate this fairly well). 

IMO 3080 should have 12GB and 3070 at least 10GB and also GDDR6X. Most people keep their GPU for about 4 years and I already see Triple AAA titles at 2021 or 2022 at the latest (when multi platform PS5/XSX/PC games will start rising) saturating 8GB VRAM. DLSS helps, but you will also most likely want to use RTX at the same time so this will negate each other in terms of VRAM usage. 

Will wait for the 3070Ti, but if it really will have 16GB this could also mean a fairly huge surcharge and I'm not willing to pay around $600 for roughly 3070 performance with just more VRAM. A 3070Ti with 12GB VRAM could be the best compromise. Let's say they will release it in Q1/2021, then dropping the price of the normal 3070 to $399 and selling the 3070Ti for $499. Could happen, but will very much depend on demand and how Big Navi will perform."
"I was pretty set on this but debating more and more about just waiting and going for a 3070.

* upgrading from a 1070. have a ryzen 3700x.
* running 1440p 144hz as well as 4k/60 TV sometimes, also have a Rift S I dont use enough but still care about running well
* most excited about RTX tbh. The generational leap of 2x + performance as well. less concerned over an extra 20%
* have a Nano S ITX case, not super worried about either card as its big for an ITX case. but not overloading it too much is appealing
* have a 650W PSU currently. Im unsure if it will be sufficient for the 3080 even though it seems like it might be, at least know it will work for a 3070
* i can afford the extra $200 if it makes sense too, i dont like throwing money away of course but it did seem reasonable to me for the upgrade.
* the month wait stinks a bit for the 3070, but if im honest with myself i dont have a huge immediate need to upgrade. waiting at least gives more time for reviews, and i should still get a card before Cyberpunk in November either way"
Looking at temps on the FE. You guys think I’ll be fine with the FE if all else fails?
"Coffin already ordered for Ampere, no chance for Nvidia, borderline lying as always and producing space heaters. I also laughed hard at the first RTX 3080 prices in my country, the cheapest model is 1100 EUR, nice.

All bow to the Ampere undertaker, the greatest graphics accelerator architecture on planet Earth, **RDNA2**... Ampere is destined to melt both literally and figuratively, RTX 3080 is losing in hashrate to the ancient father RX 5700, the foundation card for the greatest upcoming accelerator. Only better than 2080Ti by single-figures in some applications, I am cooking popcorn for RTX 3070. All people praise the **RADEON** masterpiece, buy four of them and bathe in the glory of 4-way Crossfire.

Benchmarks - *crushed*.

3.1 GHz core frequency - *reached*.

World records - *set*.

Electricity bill - *saved*.

Global warming - *stopped*.

Eternal flourishing and prosperity to all; It will soon be possible thanks to **RDNA2**.

**All pray to the greatness of RADEON.**"
"2080ti owner here.  Honestly -- a little bit let down.  

Don't get me wrong, I think 3000 series is doing an amazing job at bringing high end performance at a more affordable price. It's legitimately great from that perspective. 

My disappointment stems from the fact that I don't feel like there was a huge jump in performance from a 2080ti.  25% is nothing to sneeze at, but it's also not blowing my socks off either. 

We still have the 3090, but I feel like we're paying for VRAM we won't need to realistically use in gaming until the 3090 is already outdated :P."
" What I'm seeing is that Nvidia massively cherry picked their performance benchmarks and that these are not nearly as great as they seemed. 

Looks like AMD ought to have a relatively easy time matching it or even beating it. 

Kind of a letdown tbh."
So what is the deal with flight simulator. Why do these cards not get 4k 60fps? This is unacceptable that there is a game out currently that these cards cant max
"I'm gonna try and get the 3080 if I can't snag the 3090. If I can get the 3090 I'll sell the 3080 to 1 of my buddies if they weren't able to get it. And if they did get one and I'll post it online. It'll definitely be for more than $699 I gotta at least make it enough to break even from the tax, shipping and ontop of the (example ebay 10% and paypal I think was maybe 2% charge).Dont kill me! :("

Has anyone seen 3440x1440 benchmarks anywhere?
Thanks for all of your hard work compiling this!
"So how many people actually changed their minds and decided not to buy after seeing all these reviews? I'm still buying one, but I'm curious if the competition tomorrow has been lessened a bit"
"@op, optimum tech did not get a review card. You can put him off the list, sadly, as he said on Twitter. Would’ve loved his thoughts on the FE"
Anyone of these reviewers checked how the FE cooler affect CPU/RAM temperatures?
RIP my 970. Let's hope tomorrow morning will not be a bloodbath.
"Goodbye, 1060 3gb. You have served me well. Mostly."
Any reviews that showed benchmarks for VR games or games running at an ultrawide resolution?
"People's main complaints seem to be about power consumption and heat, but I've trained. I've lived in the hell of SLI GTX 480s. I'm ready to swap out the 1080 for 3080, this is looking like a worthy upgrade to me for 1440p 144Hz."
"[Techspot had an interesting theory](https://www.techspot.com/review/2099-geforce-rtx-3080/) about the bottlenecking at lower resolutions may not be entirely CPU based, if you were worried about your CPU not being brand new:

> We've looked deeper at the RTX 3080's performance at 1440p, so we want to comment on that. As far as we can tell, CPU bottlenecking alone is not the explanation. The reason comes down to Ampere's architecture and the change to the SM configuration that we mentioned in the introduction. The 2x FP32 design can only be fully utilized at 4K and beyond. This is because at 4K the portion of the render time per frame is heavier on FP32 shaders. At lower resolutions like 1440p, the vertice and triangle load is identical to what we see at 4K, but at the higher resolution pixel shaders and compute effect shaders are more intensive and take longer and therefore can fill the SMs FP32 ALUs better."
Any reviews specific for VR? I wonder how it performs with HP Reverb G2 (pre-production that are out now)
"[Ray Tracing performances](https://babeltechreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RTX-benches.jpg) 

RTX 3000s definitely will be much more mature cards to play games with Raytracing"
"I'm replacing my 1080 Ti, but not with a FE."
"If I had a 2080Ti, I wouldn't go for it, specially if I'm running stock and have overclock headspace. Price to performance wouldn't make sense (specially in Canadian gooses).

Currently though, on a 1080Ti and wanting to get RTX, DLSS, and other fancy schmancy stuff, yeah I'll see if I can grab one."
"Gotta add my man 2kliksphilip 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwX_eKUOyFg"
I am kind of annoyed with the lack of VR benchmarks. Missed opportunity.
Did we just get bamboozled? :D
"Well 10 series owners, we finally have something to move onto!"
"From TPU

>Overclocking on ""Ampere"" seems to be identical to ""Turing"". **The cards will sit in their power limit most of the time, also during overclocking.**

>The Founders Edition has a manual power limit adjustment range of up to 370 W, from a default of 320 W. This can help gain a little bit of extra performance, but it's not a night-and-day difference, **maybe 1% real-life performance.**

Power limit is the enemy. If you want to OC these cards, the AIB 3x pins are probably a must. Expect your clocks to jump around everywhere, increasing the power limit slider will reduce these fluctuations.

https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/images/clocks-and-thermals.png

The FE doesn't look like it has good OC headroom. Your best bet is water-cooling for additional boost clocks (about 15Mhz for every 5-8C you can lower the card if we go off of Turing.). 

I'm excited to see what the AIBs with 3 pins can do once they're in our hands."
any reviews with 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution?  it's at least 15-20% more taxing than regular 1440p from what i hear.
Man they couldn't put some captcha or something to slow down the wave of bots or give hope for humans. I didn't even get to see a change or even know it was over until I came to reddit.
"Hardware Unboxed also uploaded an amazing and detail review. Plus add it to the thread. 

https://youtu.be/csSmiaR3RVE"
Man VR is just completely glazed over this launch cycle. Any VR benchmarks by chance? Having a hard time finding any...
"[https://ibb.co/bdR8WGV](https://ibb.co/bdR8WGV)  
With power limit to 270W 3080 performs 95% as stock. It's pretty good, with undervolt i think it will perform 100% like stock on 270W."
Companies exist that run scripts to immediately put product #s into cart and checkout immediately so they can resell for profits. We never stood a chance lads.
"There’s literally no 1st party place to buy from in USA.

Fire your project manager nvidia..."
"I have a 770 so I'm going to assume I'll get my monies worth in upgrade lol, but my question is should I get the 3080 or the 3070? I don't 4K game, my monitors max is 1080p. Some advise would be much appreciated!"
Looks like I could've kept my 650W PSU for the 3080. Welp.

"Overall, a really great card. Great upgrade if you're still on Pascal.

Coming from a 2080 TI, not sure if I'll upgrade, but the software features are really making me want to. The performance is nice too and roughly what I expected.

EDIT: As some folks below me have mentioned, seems some of the new software features will come to older cards as well so even more reason to stay if you're above a 2060."
RIP to the folks that sold their 2080tis for <$500
I feel so bad for anyone who sold their gpu to get the rtx 3080
i just hope AIBs are equivalent to FE ;(
"Offtopic question: will AIBs make ""fake FE"" cards, with the slick V shaped PCB and that ""weird"" cooler design?"
"Been refreshing since 8:55, never got a slowdown but at 9:04 it flipped to out of stock.  Seems like some mighty trickery going here."
what a sham
"So the overall verdict on preference to coming for the FE is that is pretty decent?

Still trying to decide between FE AND AIB tomorrow"
"I'm still not sure what to do tomorrow. Should I go for a FE or AIB? I know this question has been asked a bunch recently but a lot of the answers were around waiting for benchmarks. Important to note that I'm not too bothered about minuscule upgrades (but if its pretty substantial, then obviously it would make sense). I'm upgrading from a GTX 970 so it's going to be way better regardless"
"Pascalesque upgrade from the RTX 20 series at 4K, but things are a bit mixed for lower resolutions. I thought it was funny how the RTX 3080 was so powerful that it hit the CPU limits in many games at 1440P and below. Truly a beastly 4K card BUT if you're going for very high framerates at 1440P and especially 1080P you should also think about other options like those cheap used 2080Ti or the upcoming 3070 as they could potentially provide better value."
"Out of stock before it loaded, nice"
Did anyone from the US even manage to get one? I don’t see one post or screenshot of someone managing to have gotten it
For me I'm probably going to be keeping my 2070 Super for the time being. The benchmarks are just not as impressive as I thought it would be.
Going from my 1080 to 3080 will be insane.
"The AIBs are nice but damn do they think a lot of them. I'll take my chance on a FE tomorrow. 
Gotta get that 4k60fps for Cyberpunk.
Thanks for all the hard work!"
"does it have a **zero fan mode**?

because that will be the only question that I need answered!!!"
"Basically, if you have a 2080 Ti, you can skip the 3080 as it's not much of an upgrade.

Waiting on the 3090 reviews."
"RTX 3080 1440p FPS  = 1080p FPS of 2080 Ti

FAST BOI"
"It seems that if you have a 2080ti or even a 2080super, I'd wait it out.  Either go all in for a 3090 if you have more funds than patience, or wait to see what the 3080 super (20gb?) Has to offer.  The 3080 will be a nice bump for people on the 1080ti performance level cards."
Am I crazy for wanting to upgrade from a 2080 super?

"Hardware Unboxed has the most sobering review,  though I still think Steve is a little too dismissive of rtx and dlss, and too forgiving of Navi.  He basically calls it a good product with too colorful marketing, and says a large part of any perceived disappointment could be attributed to Digital Foundry and Nvidia,  and not the actual performance itself. 

People really need 4k displays for this card to shine.  Cpus are too slow at the moment and rtx and dlss are only slightly improved."
Gonna be a real nice upgrade from my GTX 1080 and my 1440p 165hz monitor. Glad to see the cooler is great too. Nice.
"Thats the end of the road of my 1050 ti. 3080, here i come!!!!"
"This looks exciting, who's disappointed can just don't buy it so there will be more in stock for us.

Tomorrow is gonna be the big day!"
"As expected, very good gains, just not as good as the slides made people believe, this is very similar to Pascal against Maxwell - ""1070 faster than Titan X"" - yes, right, in a few titles with some details at some resolutions.

It's an amazing GPU nonetheless.

Kudos for the Founder Edition, amazing performance considering the 300W+ power consumption."
"Coming from a 1080 that isn't making it for ultrawide 100+hz, I'll be going 3080 for sure. However I will not be going FE, I'll be going MSI or Asus like I always do. I'm all about noise reduction and they typically have the best db vs. performance ratios."
"Hey guys, I have a 1080ti and am looking to upgrade alongside ryzen 4 when it drops. 

I have enough saved to get a 3090 (at the proposed price) but I'm beginning to feel more and more that a 3080 will be enough.

Especially as it will be purely be for gaming and not streaming or rendering. 

Am i right that the difference for me likely wont be worth the extra money or are we still a bit in the dark about it?"
"So if we want to OC and Watercool, don't go FE is what I'm hearing?"
"Great benchmark scores.

It's all down to whether Nvidia have enforced a hard power limit on the AIB partners.

There's barely any headroom on the FE for overclocking. If it's the same on the AIBs, then those 3x8 pin models are absurd as they'll offer no benefit at all."
"Now we probably know why they priced these cards so aggressively. I think the AMD cards are going to be very competitive. I mean, the price is amazing, putting 2080Ti to shame, but if you have a 2080Ti, I see no reason to sell it for a 3080. 

900 and 1000 series owners will probably buy it though, but I think they should wait to see AMD performance, before buying."
"So 3600 and 3080 should definitely be fine with a decent 600W PSU, right? Probably gonna avoid overclocking ofc."
"Guru3d has reviews of the Asus Tuf, MSI trio, and Palit.
Includes thermals."
"This looks impressive but it's definitely not the card it was touted out to be. The power consumption is pretty disappointing. 

AMD, please deliver."
"I know this is going to sound salty and I know influencers getting cards early is not even a drop in the supply bucket but its super irritating that so many shit tier youtubers get these cards in advance while half of us probably wont be able to grab one for months due to ""supply shortages"".

I mean we have people who average like 1k views a video dropping reviews on this thing where they're pairing it with CPU's from like 15 years ago. Where is the value in that?"
"I'm very surprised the FE cooler turns out to be.. not garbage at all. Considering it's looks and compact size vs AIB's, that's the one I'll try first tomorrow."
yeet
"As expected the performance difference is around 80% at 4k. Performance difference is smaller at lower resolutions but still big. It's around 70% at 1440p. Performance difference gets even bigger when RT enabled.

&#x200B;

Essentially you are getting twice performance for the same money. Additionally cooler is much better if you don't have custom loop."
"Starting to see signs of CPU bottlenecks at 1440p - I wonder how many future games this will effect. You would think the newer, flashier GPU settings will alleviate this, but I wonder.

Reddit: Wow, this was so overhyped"
Any reviews make a mention of AI/ML performance? Tensor core performance ∆ compared to a 2080 Super is what I'm most interested in.
anyone done VRAM benchmark yet ?
TechPowerUp's review states that undervolting isnt possible! IS this because Afterburner hasnt been updated or is it locked off entirely? Would the AIB cards be able to be undervolted?
"I can't find a single video that actually goes into the fan noise and how loud the card is and compared to other cards that are actually in depth.  One of my greatest issues is fan noise, I can't hear my EVGA 1080 ti sc2 at full load at all.

I can't find a video of the card at full load so I can hear it, I can't find much information at all and there isn't much about how it affects cpu temps but what I can find it doesn't affect more than a few degrees.

Does anyone know where there is some decent info on noise?  I was hoping Gamer Nexus would have more, he even got straight into it first thing but I was underwhelmed by lack of info although he will probably post another video at a later date."
Nice upgrade over my 1080. Now to see if I can actually snagged one up...
"Any idea when is the AIB embargo date?

Really wanted to see how the MSI Ventus holds up against the others."
After seeing the numbers... Navi better deliver cause this gen would be even worse than the last one.
Anybody seen any reviews having done compatibility testing of hdmi 2.1 VRR 4k@120Hz HDR with any/some/main/all hdmi 2.1 4k TVs?
"This is what I what I expected performance wise at 1440p having a 2080. I was not planning to upgrade it yet but the results are promising. However, I'd rather invest in increasing my resolution with a new main monitor within the next year and upgrade on the next refresh to properly take advantage of the performance improvements and gain in visual quality/experience by going ultrawide for example."
Thank you Nvidia for making it worth waiting 5 months to build my pc.
"Off-topic question but; Nvidia will start selling FE cards at 6 am pacific, right? So I don't have to stay up for all night and spam F5.

I know this is a dumb question but I've never built a PC or buy any graphics card before so I really need to know this."
"Well, my dear 980 SC it's time. You were the first GPU I ever had and I was lucky to have you. We've lasted a good six years together. I can't resist the call of the new cards. These look great. Now I just have to decide which one. I'm leaning on MSI, EVGA, or Founder's personally."
Has anyone benchmarked with various CPUs? Wondering how badly my 6700k will bottleneck at 1440p.
I’m assuming the timeline for the 3090 reviews will be the same as these. So reviews on the 23rd and on sale on the 24th? Is that fair to assume?
Did anyone mention what kind of fan bearings the 3080 FE uses?
"Pretty underwhelming IMO.  Way better deal for those in the market now than I was when I got back into desktop PCs. Reviews generally nailed it:  worthwhile cards.  Since I am pleased enough with where I am at I will hold out for the next gen, hopefully on a TSMC process(or whoever the fab-master is at that time).  Its not enough of an upgrade for my 1440p uses to justify the cash outlay or the hassle of draining the loop even."
"The 1440p benchmarks bode well for me, coming from a 1080 Ti. Wouldn't upgrade from anything above a 2080 if that was my case, simply because of how much money I would lose. 

I don't expect the 3070 to be truly better than the 2080 Ti in anything besides full raytraced games like Minecraft."
" I have to say, I'm surprised to hear bitwit recommend that a 550W PSU may be enough for this card. Granted, the power draw in his review was below 550W, but many users will have additional peripherals plugged into their systems; HDDs, SSDs, keyboard, mouse, etc. and that will likely put you beyond the capabilities of a 550W PSU. I'd recommend at least a 650W unit, but 750W is probably the better choice to provide a safe amount of headroom."
I guess I'll finally get rid of my [AMD 7970 GHz Edition](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-hd-7970-toxic-6-gb/).  Hopefully I'll see an improvement :)
Upgrading from RX 480! It was a great card and will always be remembered.
"I'm not here for gaming but is anyone else excited for rendering performance? techgage shows the 3080 beating the 2080ti by cutting renderings times in almost half. 4 years ago, I was doing renders with 6 1080ti's and sold them off slowly with the last one getting 500 dollars a couple months ago. It seems like with ray tracing and optiX, one 3080 is going to beat my render times with 6 1080ti's."
I haven't noticed in the reviews I've seen so far but does the fan on the 3080FE shut off at idle?
Are NVIDIA and Best Buy the only two places selling FE?
" i dont know if this question has been asked and answered, but how are people on ebay already have confirmed pre-orders and there's like already 40 cards sold? there's no pre-orders at all for the 3000's right?"
"Will I be bottlenecked by my CPU if I am gaming at 1440p?

I have a GTX 1080 and an i7-700k with 16 gb ram (3200 mHz) and 1 TB SSD and I have an Acer Predator monitor that runs at 165hz overclocked."
"Never changed from ""notify me"" did they even post em?"
Well everything went from coming soon to sold out before I had a chance to press anything. Didn't even get the false hope of it pretending to load a 3080 into my cart. Anyone have any idea how long it is before round 2 comes out?
"Got my order through 15 seconds after they launched, hopefully i was quick enough.."
[How life goes](https://i.imgur.com/zomqg2j.png)
"Overall I'm still pretty impressed with the performance. A little disappointing to me that so many reviewers/consumers (especially LTT and they had to add a *disclaimer in the video) are stuck on ""2x the performance of the 2080!"" when in reality it was ""UP TO 2x the performance of the 2080"" and with a little common sense with how companies like to advertise products means in very very specific scenarios will you actually see a 100% performance increase. I feel the circle of people I just described are the same people that get baited in by all the ""Interest rate AS LOW AS ___%"" and get mad when they dont qualify for the rock bottom rate with a credit score in the 500s

Regardless I'm pleased! Especially with the fan noise/temps. I'm sure it'll be even better in an actual tower with optimized airflow vs an open bench where hopefully the design to have ~50% of the hot air pushed out the back vs 100% into the case is more apparent.

Big thanks to you guys for putting all this together!"
***ARE WE GETTING A NEW NVIDIA GAME READY DRIVER TODAY?!***
Amazing results.  Can't wait to get my hands on one of these and the 3090.
"Does anyone know if NZXT or ibuypower will be offering these in their custom builds starting tomorrow?



Wife gave me the go ahead to get a new $3000+ rig so I'm gonna go all out including one of these bad boys."
I'll still be upgrading from my 1080ti. I think I'm right on the edge for it being a worthwhile upgrade - anything better in the 20-series lineup would probably not be imo.
Cards are on eBay for $1400+ with dozens of bids
Where can I find information as to when they release tomorrow? Would like to order mine online asap.
Well this just solidifies my decision to finally upgrade from my 1080Ti.
"most games gains between 40 and 100fps compared to a 1080ti at 1440p so not too bad, my only concern is the temperature which seems kinda high especially since this new cooler was supposed to be a lot better but we'll see how the aibs will perform"
"You son of a bitch, I'm in!"
DId any outlet measure the exact dimension of the card? Especially its width? edit: its 3.8cm
[deleted]
"There are some excellent reviews out there, but all of them are severely lacking from what I can see. Nvidia is pushing ML, and that's supposed to be the big thing with Ampere. Still, none of the reviews I can find even touches the subject of ML performance. :("
"So I‘m currently running a 1080 OC with a 1440p Monitor (CPU: i7-7700K). Not planning to get a 4k for at least the next two years. Pretty happy with 1440p at the moment.

Playing mostly Flightsims (getting stable 25 to 35 fps on high in MSFS 2020 atm), racing sims and some shooters. 

Question for all who are better hardware pros than I will ever be: is it worth to buy the 3080 or better to go for a 2080 Super OC for a good price? (seems to me that the prices for the not FEs are going up in Germany tomorrow and the following days)"
Has anyone seen a benchmark with Fallout 4 yet or 1440p ultrawide numbers?
"Worth upgrading a 2070 (non super) for 1440p 144Hz and 4k 60?

Currently on a 9600k and 650W PSU"
"Going from a 2070 Super, I am going to get it on the basis that I'm going to a dual monitor setup. Really disappointed in the Microsoft Flight Sim performance, but that's down to MSFS being poorly optimized and being tied to CPU performance. Hopefully their upcoming patch takes more advantage of the GPU"
"So hypothetically, if AMD Big Navi isn't in between 3070 and 3080 performance for roughly the cost of a 3070, Big Navi is dead in the water?"
"So, people who sold their 2080 Ti cards with a good value, are you going 3080 or 3090 for 1440p gaming? Still need to see what AIBs are gonna do with overclocking etc. but still in dilemma."

Should we wait for non founders? What's the consensus?
"Why did Anandtech not do a review, did they not a GPU ?"
4k or 1440 monitor... the upgrade is apparently much more worth it at 4k. Hmm.
"Not that great imo, though I am still looking to get one to replace the old 980ti.  

&#x200B;

Performance increases but so does power consumption.  I think that's the biggest disappointment for me honestly is the power hunger (Samsung 8nm problems).  Bigger uplift in rtx performance will likely play in to longevity.

&#x200B;

This generation only looks good because of how bad the 2000 series was price and performance wise."
"Currently on a 1080Ti, looks like a massive leap in performance. I still only have a 6700k though, but I have it clocked at 4.5GHz and I play at 1440p144hz so hopefully it doesn't hold me back too much."
"On RAM size, doesn't the Ampere series offer a new feature of I/O optimization that means you don't need as much video RAM as before?"
So when is Reflex being released? I have only watched LTT's review so far and he mentions it will be released today...but I cant find anything for it other than the announcement and its page on nvidia's site but no download links. Am I just too early?
"Phew, looking at the FPS increase in games from a GTX 1080 to a 3080 is big. I can't wait!"
Does a PCIE 4.0 SSD on an AMD Ryzen 3000 series + processor improve these scores or was that tested by one of these reviews?
So long R9 390!!
"Going to be a spendy week. New Apple Watch purchased already and now a new GPU, if all goes as planned."
Anyone come across WoW: Shadowlands benchmarks? This should be benchmarked considering its releasing roughly the same time as the 3k series...
I wish they'd lift the 3090 embargo as well. I'm debating between the 3080 and 3090 and am curious how much of a boost itd give exactly.
"I asked this in another subreddit already but i'll ask it agian

 Is it okay if i use 1 PCIe 6+2 cable and daisy chain with the other one? I'm asking because almost all third party GPUs use 3x8 pin connectors and my psu only has 2 6+2 PCIe connectors. My PSU is a Corsair RM750i"
"Well damn, the founders edition looks *really* nice right now. I've never bought a founders edition card, but how much performance improvement can there really be with the AIB cards?"
Ive watched some reviews but can anyone tell me if my i5-8600k will bottleneck a 3080?
"I don't all watch videos and read articles. Watched GN (the methodology guy), HU (the game benchmark guy), DF (the Crisis guy, but see below), Paul (the decent and wise guy), and Kyle (love the fact that he used 3600XT), Dave Lee (showing his Ghost build and failure to run with 600W PSU with 10900K) then also go through the Guru 3D (recommending 650 W PSU) and TechPowerUp (undervolt/overclock explanations).


But I really like Digital Foundry reviews overall, every minutes of Richard explanations were really useful, he also tries to give the big picture (type of games according to the extent of improvement) and scenario to scenario analysis (what is limiting the performance, and if you have Turing or Pascal at the moment). I agree with their statement when they mention ""Brute Force Power"".


My take away:
I am OK with the RTX3080 performance (so, still impressive, esp. that 4K performance) and definitely offers a lot of value now buying GPU at 700USD range for the performance it can offer especially considering how crazy it was with the high end of the the RTX20-series but at the same time I am disappointed about the power figures (performance/watt). After checking further, sadly there is no way to undervolt RTX3080 (TechPowerUp). Probably this is the best way to upgrade if you are with Pascal card now and having the budget and headroom (thermal, power), but even more conditional if you are with Turing now."
[deleted]
I still do not get the thing about the 12-pin connector. Is the adapter necessary? Can't you just use two cables if you don't care about cable management or just prettier looks?
"It seems the fastest gamer CPU (Intel 10900) is bottlenecking the 3080 in FHD.

Waiting for faster CPUs."
Has anyone seen any hashcat benchmarks?
did any of them test on warzone? i clicked a couple and couldn't fin any cod benchmarks...some of those games they tested you don't even benefit from having high fps.
How hard is it gonna be to grab one tomorrow if I'm sitting at my pc? Near impossible? Doable but gotta be quick? 15 minute window?
Best place to get MSI gaming trio on launch day?
"I really like how Digital Foundry focused on pascal comparisons. Coming from a 1070, I’m so excited."
Just take my money
Amazing card! But It doesn't make sense to upgrade if I'm currently playing on 1440p with an OC'd AIB 2080ti. Perhaps the 3080ti will make me jump.
Such a shame that the FE is limited by power limit and can't be overclocked further... Since the temp is only around 75C on full load.
"I get it's the optimal comparison, but it bothers me so many reviewers completely slipped comparing this against 10 series cards.

I get you can extrapolate amounts by figuring out the difference between the 10 and 20 series cards then go from there, but it feels like a wasted opportunity.

Turing sold like ass. Nvidia even acknowledged this. These articles should be about convincing 10 series buyers to make the plunge into the 30 series cards. Instead it's all just trying to combat nvidia marketing. ""Is it actually 2x the speed of a 2080! Let's find out!"""
"So guys , what should I do? Keep an ASUS ROG Strix non OC version or try to buy a founders for 90€ less? I would really like to overclock the shit out of this card."
"What I'm getting from this is, upgrading from my 1070 is going to be great."
"I'm wondering if I should go for an AIB and keep the H500i that I have, with somewhat restricted airflow, or buy an FE and a new case with better airflow. I'd probably for the FTW3 Ultra, which would barely fit in my current case"
I want to add [this review](https://elchapuzasinformatico.com/2020/09/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition-review/) that have some nice pictures of the pcb and benchmarks.
"I'm still conflicted.
I have a GTX 980 and have been waiting to upgrade. 
I want the best for VR but I dunno what to choose.
Do I spend more for a 3090? Do I wait for Ti versions?
Wait for AMD to see how their value is?
I just want a more stable and smooth VR experience =["
"Haven't read all the reviews in detail but it looks like the benefits are very good for higher resolutions than 1080p. Ofc this is comparing the cards to the older gen 1xxx series and before that. But if you're still stuck on 1080p and you have the 2xxx series, it wouldn't be as compelling to upgrade to the 3xxx series. The only thing I'm seeing that doesn't really benefit at all is if you have the 2080ti and you're still gaming on 1080p, which has very little benefits.

&#x200B;

In my case, I may plan to upgrade to maybe a 3070 only because I currently have a 2060 and testing MS Flight Simulator is actually the only game that struggled with it. For everybody else, this card should be future proof for any 1080p gaming and a very nice bump if you did want to go 1440p or higher in the future."
yo. is the 3080 gonna get bottlenecked by a 6700k playing at 1440p? gamernexus' video makes it seem this way.
Anandtech really needs to hire people that can put out reviews on time. They had an extra 2 days from original date . everyone else got theirs done.  They had the same issue last gen
"stock cooler seems pretty good, wonder how much cooler the others will run"
"Running a 2070s right now. I rotate two monitors currently, 1080p 144hz and 1440 144hz. 

My problem is that even on the 1080p, games like RDR2 don't get over 70ish fps 100% of the time. Goal is highest noticeable settings and highest possible frame rate. 

Considering the upgrade."
Worth upgrading a 2080 Super for this?  I play at 1440p 144.
I'm having a real hard time deciding between MSI or FE
So on the fence ordering tomorrow.  I have a 2080 right now with a 1440p monitor and every non VR game I throw at it it works fine.  But I have a Hp reverb G2 on order which is basically 4K between both eyes.  So the 3080 will definitely be an improvement for it...  but how much of an improvement...
If I don't get one tomorrow I'll wait to see how the 3079 preforms. I'm most likely to get that since I've had a 970/1070/2070
"So I'm on a GTX970 running on a 1080p 1920x1080 Asus VS24H 60Hz monitor. I'm going to assume that the 3070 will be more than enough? (i7-6700k 4Ghz, 32GB DDR4, Samsung EVO SSDs)"
Goodbye RTX 2060 it was a good year but your time has come.
"I'm stuck at work and can't watch the videos.

Would anyone that watched a few be able to tell me how are the thermals? I usually care more about that vs fps.  What I mean is if I can game around 60-65c I would gladly pay for that vs getting 10 fps more when I'm already at 100+ fps.  

My hope is that this card is avg 70c and the evga hybrid at 60c.  


Thanks"
Well the hype has died down.. but to more realistic expectations. I own a 1060 6GB and I'll still be picking one up and completing my new build and letting it stay that way for years to come.
"So, based on this release and Nvidia's past releases, how much of an improvement can we expect from the 3080ti version?"
"This looks awesome! I'm in two minds though about what route to go down, I have a 7700k overclocked to 4.9 and I game at 1440p with a 1080ti. I stream too and I want to have the best quality streaming I can especially with a game like Cyberpunk coming out, would a 3080 be ok or should I just spend that bit more and get a 3090? I will at some point in the next 6 months be building a completely new rig depending on zen 3/next gen intel."
Buying this tomorrow hopefully. Excited!

This list looks actually pretty complete to me."
"I reckon I'm at the perfect point here, with a 1070 gaming x and a uwqhd monitor this thing is gonna steam through my games library.

Fingers crossed for tomorrow!"
Why is there no comparison between FE and AIB yet?
"Thank you for compiling all of this data. You are awesome! 

As a 980ti owner, this upgrade will make me really happy :) Recently upgraded my CPU to Ryzen 3700 too, this should be a really nice combo for my 2560x1440p monitor."
"Just curious, but have there been any AIB model reviews yet? I know the FE is probably the best bang for the buck, but in the case that the FE is sold out I'd like to see more info for the AIB models."
"So PC Gamer is quite the outlier.

\+50% @ 1440P over 2080Ti."
What time of day do orders begin tomorrow? Cant find a shred of info anywhere on this.
Any reviewers play on LG C9 with 4K 120HZ?
"If I make the move to game exclusively on an OLED I'll buy it. 4K gaming is beautiful, but high refresh rate 1080p and 1440p will be fine with a GTX 1080 for the time being."
"I'm sorry if this was already answered but I can't seem to find it in any of the previous threads:

Is there going to be a per customer limit on the 3080 tomorrow morning? Or is NVIDIA going to allow all of the 3P sellers with their bots to scoop them all up in the first 2 seconds?"
i'm scared for my 6700k

"So the biggest difference is at 4K and synthetic/heavy processing workloads. For most of us, we may need to buy a TV/monitor that can push higher resolution and framerates. 🤷‍♂️

But most are using 1080p and 1440p, and the value starts fading when comparing a 2080ti and a 3080. The difference in FPS is something to mention, but above 120fps most users will not really be able to benefit from the gains. 🤔

Sure, more frames are great and it can make a difference in more series competitive gameplay. But after a certain point it is performance that is almost purely for personal satisfaction and tricky to tell the difference. 😔"
Anyone have a mathematical model to predict the 3090 performance using the 3080 benchmarks as a starting point? I’d really like to hit 4k120 for use with my LG OLED C9 but it looks like the 3080 won’t hit that. I typically play Fortnite with my kids using a 2080 Super and hit 120+ consistently using ultra settings at 1440p.
Currently running a 4790k with a 2060FE. I'm upgrading my whole rig and I'm definitely in for the 3080. I have a 3440x1440p monitor so just need to wait on the new Ryzen Cpus before its complete. I'm super Psyched! Hope all who are after one manage to snag one on release :)
"Are FEs limited stock? As in, eventually they stop selling them? If so how long until they stopped selling 20XX FEs?"
"I'm mostly upgrading to get access to HDMI 2.1 to make full use of my LG C9 so I can output 4k/120hz/HDR/4:4:4/12bit

That being said it still seems like a well worthwhile upgrade from a 1080, albeit not quite as notable a performance gain in all scenarios"
[deleted]
"I have a 1080ti and playing at 1440p at 165Hz and I am on the fence. The games I currently am playing don't really require me to upgrade but it will be nice to have for the next few years.

I have a 8700k cpu so I don't think bottlenecking will be an issue. Bitwit tested the 3080 with a Ryzen 3600 and it performed well. But if I do end up choosing to upgrade, I would at least wait for the Ryzen Zen 3 cpus and build a new system around that.

I would not be looking forward to the power consumption..."
Coil whine/noises seem to be really common for FE which. I find that unacceptable for a card and I really wouldn't like to buy a card that has a high chance for coil whine. Other than that the FE seems really nice (but damn that power use...).
"For a novice trying to figure things out, is there a reason to get OC versions of this 3080 as opposed to the normal versions? For example, I see the ASUS ROG STRIX 3080 in both regular and OC versions...what's the difference and real benefit here?"
"ok now we have enough information on the rtx 3080 to form our own opinions. now what we need are AIB LEAKS BEFORE TOMORROW. COME ON, AIB OWNERS. DO US ALL A FAVOR"
Has any reviewers confirmed the SR-IOV is enabled on these cards?
"based on tomshardware.com, our quad cores are fucked, even at 1440p. my poor 6700k. fuck, i don't know what i'm gonna do now. i have less than 24 hours to decide.

https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ampere-cpu-scaling-benchmarks"
"Bitwit seems to think 3600 is fine for 3080.

I have gone from thinking Ill need 3090 to 3080, and now I might not need a zen 3 and theres no reason for me to get a NVME ssd like I was just about to ( I thought rtx io was coming out with the 3000 series at launch ). Looks like ill be getting a ps5 after all, and having lots left over. Had $3500 AUD saved for all this, looking at $1600 now."
"Maybe a silly question but Nvidia hasn't released drivers yet, right? These game benchmarks may as well improve with some driver tweaking down the line."
"How long does it typically take for a super or TI version to come out for these cards?
Also for AIB would it be better to wait for the second generation with better coolers?"
Are there speed charts for aftermarkets anywhere? I could have sworn I saw the MSI Gaming X running at 1815 instead of 1700 but I can't find again where ever I saw that.
Anyone know what is the very best AIB (non watercooled) under 310mm ?
"Want one, but don't want to deal with ordering an AIB without reviews being out."
"Did anyone see a reviewer test warzone? That game runs like shit on my 1080 at 1440p

"Has anyone else noticed huge differences in temperatures and noise levels from reviewer to reviewer?

&#x200B;

Edit: and if anyone has a link to a review that talks about overclocking (other than GN)  I'd appreciate it"
"Can't take an in depth look at the reviews right now as I'm at work.

Planning to upgrade to the 3080, coming from a 970. I have an i5 9600k. Will my CPU be okay with the 3080 at 1440p? Planning to upgrade my CPU/MOBO next year but want to make sure it won't cause any major issues until then."
Annoying the details for the AIB's won't be out until tomorrow. I want to get the founders atm but if I can't I don't know what the best cheap alternative AIB card would be. Can see myself missing out for a while if I can't get the founders because I don't want to order a bad AIB card.
Anyone know a review that tested Warzone at 4K?
"Probably gonna upgrade this year to a 3080, coming from a 1080ti... actually impressed by the undervolting... roughly 50w less for the same performance and a stable 1800mhz clock."
"Any 2080TI sli vs 3080 or 2070S sli vs 3080?

I saw the 4k results for the 3080 I'm not very impressed as we still struggle to run 4k in 2020.

 I think my best bet is to purchase 3090 ×2 and hope for 144fps at 4k ultra.

I know I could just lower the settings which js more practical and I'm on the fence about upgrading 2070S to 3080"

When will AIB reviews come out?
"Should I get a RTX 3080? Or keep the RTX 2070?

"Super excited to see the good reviews and performance increases, but it does look like the bump from 2080ti to 3080 may not be that huge. These benchmarks are making me kinda lean towards splurging on the 3090."
I'm currently using an OCZ ModXStream Pro 600w power supply that I've used since 2012 and have a secondary Corsair CX600M power supply (green label) that was never really used. Will either of these two be able to power a Ryzen 7 3700x and RTX 3080 at stock?
[deleted]
"So what I was most interested in was knowing if the cooler was any good on the FE. It obviously seems pretty good and an improvement over previous FEs, but reviewers don't seem to mention how it compares to previous third party solutions?

Do we know if the FE is good even compared to third party solutions?"
If its still a 83% increase from my 2070s then 3080 here i come!
Why no 2060s % comparison ? :/
"I am not very tech savy anymore these days, and I was wondering if someone could offer some advice.  Based on reviews I am seeing that at lower resolutions and lower CPUs the 3080 suffers a bit in comparison...

For someone with a i5-4670 and a 970 right now who only has a 1080 monitor... is  there any reason to upgrade to a 3080 tomorrow?  I plan to eventually piece-meal upgrade my system but it would be christmas at the earliest that I would have a new cpu/mobo and monitor and gpu."
So 6am PST? @ Nvidia.com?

Would it be beneficial for me to replace my whole monitor and get the RTX 3080, or should i just sell my 1070 and get a 1080ti EVGA B-stock, so that I'm still able to use my DVI monitor a few more years?"
Does anyone know if Afterburner will be able to control the 3 fans on an evga xc3? It only controls one fan on my 1080ti SC2. Ideally moving the fans speed slider in afterburner would change all 3 fans. If not I may have to get an FE.
Is anyone going try order direct from Nvidia or are people just straight up giving up on it?

"Now that benchmarks are out, on average the 3080 seems to be 25-30% faster than a 2080 Ti, and the ""up to 2x 2080"" has a big asterisk on it (only in a couple games, and usually RTX/DLSS has to be on).

Based on CUDA core count, the 3080 has 48% more CUDA cores than the 3070. Do we really think the 3070 will beat the 2080 Ti across the board? I am not seeing it.

I predict the 3070 will be 10% slower than the 2080 Ti in most titles, only surpassing it in RTX titles and maybe Doom.

&#x200B;

Also, the 3090 only has 21% more CUDA cores than the 3080. Are we about to see only a 10-15% performance increase on a $1500 GPU vs $700?"

Won't all these benchmarks improve once the right drivers come out?
Anyone know if it's a bad idea to upgrade if i have a 1080 and Ryzen 2600x?
What are the chances of getting one of these in a month or so?
"I'm sure this question is being asked non stop in the various threads but I thought I'd ask it again.

Looking at the specs of the AIM cards that are now up on the various store websites, looks like they bump up the clock from 1.7 to 1.75 and 1.8 depending on price.  I saw wattage listed at 750 for EVGA.  I'm sure there are other details I've missed.  Prices are also higher for AIM (by about $200 canadian)

I'm not an overclocker and noise and heat matter to me.  I am leaning towards FE if I can get my hands on one, but thought I'd do a last minute census."

"In summary, it's good."
"Looks very impressive over all.

The review by Linus was the first time I heard about this miscommunication concerning SR-IOV and, being someone who'd benefit from that on consumer cards, it was a bit of a rollercoaster between getting excited and crashing down back to reality once it truned out that this was in fact just a misunderstanding.

I know that it is very unlikely, especially considering the number of people who'd benefit from SR-IOV support is tiny, though I'd still love to see Nvidia enable this funcitionality for regular users. Even just a limited, highly restricted implementation to not canibalize Quadro/Tesla sales would be appreciated.

They could go so far as to lock this down to only being able to ""split"" the GPU once, the ability to continue running the host system without the need to stop the display manager while using a guest would be greatly appreciated by those who, due to space constraints (ITX builds, rack mounted servers with limited PCIe slotes) and because their CPU has no graphics unit included are currently unable to passthrough their GPU without disabling the display manager.

I get that this is very unlikely, almost impossible, but one can always hope."
this card is soo effing good for rendering. damn.
Gamers nexus didn’t show a big improvement in OC. So 3080 seems plenty good for 1440p.
[deleted]
so is 3080 an overkill for 1440P 144hz gaming or is it perfect for it?  Debating 3070 vs 3080.
"TLDR:

Can't do Red Dead Redemption 2 4k Ultra 60fps 99%."
"Eh, not good enough.  Just going to hang on to my 980ti until next gen :D /sarcasm"
"I'm skeptical about the 3070. Seeing how the 3080 didn't deliver the performance increase that Jensen said it would across other titles, I'm not sure if the 3070 will equal the 2080 ti - maybe just for doom eternal hahah

Don't get me wrong I'm still upgrading this generation (still running an rx 580). I'll just wait and see how the 3070 winds up and then choose between the 3070/3080"
Has anyone benchmarked it against a 970? Would love to see what gains I'm about to get.
"No question about buying the 3080. Moving from a 980 SLI setup will be an incredible change, especially at 4K, something I had to compromise on many games from 2014-2017 and can't play above 1440p nowadays"
too much text.
Any review that look into vram limitations? I feel like a card 60 to 80% faster only getting 25% more ram is going to be an issue. Considering the 1080ti had more vram for the same price 4 year ago.
"seems VERY bad in flight sim, maybe because of low VRAM?"
"2080ti owner, happy to sit out this gen"
"Any good review/benchmark that looked at 3080 Vs 2070 (non super) at 1440?
It seems a lot of 2070 super users are on the fence, and the difference between 2070 and 2070 super isn't that big anyway... I was pretty set on trying to get a 3080 FE tomorrow, but if all I'll be getting is a 20% jump I think I might skip this circle and wait for TI's...
Running a 3900X, so it seems an even easier bottleneck..."
"TBH I think Nvidia just fucked all the AIB cards big time.

AIBs with their old school, boring, unappealing designs... which cost MORE than nvidia's card? LOL.

Gotta say nvidia came out and hit a grand slam with this one im sure many AIBs are sweatin."
"For those who currently have a turing, especially a 2090 Ti like myself, I think the results show it’s worth waiting. 

AMD is going to come out and may get close to 3080 but likely with much less power draw. 

If that is the case then 2080Ti owners might be better off going AMD This gen (sin for team green for lifers like me I know I know) OR waiting for the NVDA response.

And believe me NVDA will have a response. Did we get Tis yet? Nope. Supers? Nope. 

Patience may pay off here."
Anyone with 550W PSU still going for 3080?
"Any fortnite benchmarks out there yet? I guess I'll wait for the RTX update as that will be a major factor in if I decide to move from my 2070 Super or not.

I swear you guys downvote anything. I'm aiming for 1440p and 240fps with settings higher than low. My bad for enjoying something, sheesh."
Any info on performance improvement from 2080 Super to 3080?
[deleted]
"Nice performance upgrade, but like [computerbase.de](https://computerbase.de) showed, it's about the same compared between Maxwell and Pascal. Really good but that's how it should be. In my opinion the $699 for the 3080 is fair, but the $499 for the upcoming 3070 is too expensive. It's the same like RTX 2070 and that was alredy too much. I'm aware we talking about RTX cards with additional Tensor and RT cores, but that should be a point for the first gen (early adopters), but not anymore on the second one. It's called technical progress and even new consoles/RNDA2 getting dedicated Raytracing hardware (although it seems not on the level of Nvidia) show it's slowly becoming mainstream.

Last generations had the x70 normally at $349-$399 price range and another ""bad aftertaste"" is it having 8GB VRAM (and normal GDDR6). That means 8GB for the third time and this can quickly become more of a bottleneck for 4K than the raw GPU power of the card (now knowing the performance of the 3080 we can estimate this fairly well). 

IMO 3080 should have 12GB and 3070 at least 10GB and also GDDR6X. Most people keep their GPU for about 4 years and I already see Triple AAA titles at 2021 or 2022 at the latest (when multi platform PS5/XSX/PC games will start rising) saturating 8GB VRAM. DLSS helps, but you will also most likely want to use RTX at the same time so this will negate each other in terms of VRAM usage. 

Will wait for the 3070Ti, but if it really will have 16GB this could also mean a fairly huge surcharge and I'm not willing to pay around $600 for roughly 3070 performance with just more VRAM. A 3070Ti with 12GB VRAM could be the best compromise. Let's say they will release it in Q1/2021, then dropping the price of the normal 3070 to $399 and selling the 3070Ti for $499. Could happen, but will very much depend on demand and how Big Navi will perform."
"I was pretty set on this but debating more and more about just waiting and going for a 3070.

* upgrading from a 1070. have a ryzen 3700x.
* running 1440p 144hz as well as 4k/60 TV sometimes, also have a Rift S I dont use enough but still care about running well
* most excited about RTX tbh. The generational leap of 2x + performance as well. less concerned over an extra 20%
* have a Nano S ITX case, not super worried about either card as its big for an ITX case. but not overloading it too much is appealing
* have a 650W PSU currently. Im unsure if it will be sufficient for the 3080 even though it seems like it might be, at least know it will work for a 3070
* i can afford the extra $200 if it makes sense too, i dont like throwing money away of course but it did seem reasonable to me for the upgrade.
* the month wait stinks a bit for the 3070, but if im honest with myself i dont have a huge immediate need to upgrade. waiting at least gives more time for reviews, and i should still get a card before Cyberpunk in November either way"
Looking at temps on the FE. You guys think I’ll be fine with the FE if all else fails?
"Coffin already ordered for Ampere, no chance for Nvidia, borderline lying as always and producing space heaters. I also laughed hard at the first RTX 3080 prices in my country, the cheapest model is 1100 EUR, nice.

All bow to the Ampere undertaker, the greatest graphics accelerator architecture on planet Earth, **RDNA2**... Ampere is destined to melt both literally and figuratively, RTX 3080 is losing in hashrate to the ancient father RX 5700, the foundation card for the greatest upcoming accelerator. Only better than 2080Ti by single-figures in some applications, I am cooking popcorn for RTX 3070. All people praise the **RADEON** masterpiece, buy four of them and bathe in the glory of 4-way Crossfire.

Benchmarks - *crushed*.

3.1 GHz core frequency - *reached*.

World records - *set*.

Electricity bill - *saved*.

Global warming - *stopped*.

Eternal flourishing and prosperity to all; It will soon be possible thanks to **RDNA2**.

**All pray to the greatness of RADEON.**"
"2080ti owner here.  Honestly -- a little bit let down.  

Don't get me wrong, I think 3000 series is doing an amazing job at bringing high end performance at a more affordable price. It's legitimately great from that perspective. 

My disappointment stems from the fact that I don't feel like there was a huge jump in performance from a 2080ti.  25% is nothing to sneeze at, but it's also not blowing my socks off either. 

We still have the 3090, but I feel like we're paying for VRAM we won't need to realistically use in gaming until the 3090 is already outdated :P."
" What I'm seeing is that Nvidia massively cherry picked their performance benchmarks and that these are not nearly as great as they seemed. 

Looks like AMD ought to have a relatively easy time matching it or even beating it. 

Kind of a letdown tbh."
So what is the deal with flight simulator. Why do these cards not get 4k 60fps? This is unacceptable that there is a game out currently that these cards cant max
"I'm gonna try and get the 3080 if I can't snag the 3090. If I can get the 3090 I'll sell the 3080 to 1 of my buddies if they weren't able to get it. And if they did get one and I'll post it online. It'll definitely be for more than $699 I gotta at least make it enough to break even from the tax, shipping and ontop of the (example ebay 10% and paypal I think was maybe 2% charge).Dont kill me! :("
"It's probably safe to assume that the performance increase would be somewhere between the 4k and 1440p increase, right? Not a linear relationship because the aspect ratio is higher so you have not only more pixels but more objects to draw in the extra screen space."
"I've got this link: https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Geforce-RTX-3080-Grafikkarte-276730/Tests/Test-Review-Founders-Edition-1357408/4/

It's in German, but there are drop down boxes where you can check-mark the frame rates you want to compare and an option for 3440x1440"

"https://youtu.be/bhBVJe3BASI 3440x1440p benchmarks. Although the YouTuber spends 11.30 minutes of a 15 minute video talking about g skills ram and building a pc. Last 4 minutes he plays horizon zero dawn, control and apex. 

Horrible review video but will give you some idea of performance"
I saw somewhere that you can assume 60fps in 4k would equal 80-90fps in UW 1440p.
"Yes,

It will be perfect for 3440x1440 . Less CPU bound but also not as demanding as 4k
Looking for the same.
Multiply the pixels of 1440*3440 and 2160x3840 and you have your relative difficulty if you divide the numbers
"TLDR:

- Can't do RDR2 4K ultra 60fps stable.

- FS2020 still sucks at any resolution."
Seriously! Such a time saver.
"Im sure many 2080s and ti owners will be happily waiting for the next generation. I think the launch will be not as short as some think, will propably last for half a day or so

edit: Well this only counted if it wasnt a fucking paper launch, lol."
no one should attempt to buy the 3080s at all tomorrow....
"I'm currently on a 1080Ti, so it's a massive increase. However, I'm still on a 6700k so I'm not sure how much that will hold me back. I play at 1440p 144hz so hopefully I'm not that capped."
"I'm not sure now.. probably still getting one (though with better cooling, the FE seems a bit too loud), but the card is nowhere even close to 2x 2080 performance.

Hell, my 5700XT is 65% of a 3080 based on Igor's benchmarks in 1440p.

So a bit disappointed."
Going from a stock 1080 and yes this is the upgrade I waited for.
I have a 2080ti Kingpin and game at 4k. After seeing reviews I'll hold on to what I have and wait for 3090 reviews
1070 owner. All this decided for me was whether I get a 4K or 1440p monitor to pair it with. 1440p it is.
"Yeah, the reviews are making me heavily consider the 3080 instead of the 3090. Starting to see how 5-15 percent increase won’t justify the extra $800.00 that could go to a new 4k screen."
"I have a 2080, I was already on the fence but I can definitely hold off another year before buying now."
"Yeah it has, I'm out"
"I'm running on a 5700 XT so yeah, still in for the 3080! Now I'm debating if I should go full bore and upgrade to a 4K monitor from my current 1440p."
Im in. My GPU is too freakin old.
"Basically I'm going to look if any are available but not actively try for one, if that makes sense. Hope the hydro copper one is available."
"Definitely tamed the hype. Still going to see how the 3090 performs first though.

I find it funny I got downvoted yesterday when someone asked if today's benchmarks would change my decision. No shit they'll play a factor!"
"Well look at it this way.  Now the 2080 users dont have to try and panic sale and can sit out and wait to see which refresher comes out next year or what the next generation will bring.  They can also hold off until the AMD presentation.

For us that skip a gen or more, going from a 1080ti to a 3080 is going to be great and with these reviews out, i can take tonight and see if i really want to upgrade given that Im not really playing anything that is currently pushing my card."
"I was certain based on the leaks that I wasn't upgrading from my 1080 Ti. Now I'm dead set waiting for Hopper. I called it when I said at most 60-70% faster and for the most part that's spot on. There's a couple outliers at 4k but the average difference at 1440p, my preferred resolution, is only 55%. 4 years of waiting and all we get is 55% on average. Disappointed."
"I actually got relieved that my 2080Ti held up so well compared to 3080. I don't feel that the upgrade is necessary seeing as I don't even play in 4K (sometimes VR though), and most of it is CPU bound anyway.

3090 is a big no-go for me because of that ridiculous price, no matter how strong it is."
"Can't do RDR2 4K ultra 60fps stable and FS2020 still sucks at any resolution.

I am more than happy to wait for the 3080Ti with 12GB."
"Yeah, I'm not onboard for the time being. Will see if DLSS 2.1 is widely implemented, if not I'll hang on for next gen. Not a big enough jump outside of that, and raytracing still isn't particularly doable. All I'm really playing ATM is Diablo 2 anyway lol, so not in a rush."
"Only read the first review from AnandTech so far, what’s the general consensus on the card? From your comment it doesn’t seem quite as positive as I had inferred."
"Had planned on staying up, spamming F5, setting up alerts, etc., if it was 75%+ improvement. I'm now fine with relaxing and waiting a few months, maybe grab one on sale or open box. Currently have a 2080."
"Didn't so much change my mind as calm me down. I'm on a 2070 Super, and DLSS 2.0 has really brought RTX performance up to a level where I'm super happy. I just like new toys! But yeah these reviews have brought me back down to earth and I shall try to resist the urge and be a bit more sensible."
"Coming from a 1070 and gaming at 1440p, I'm tempted, but that power draw is my main gripe. I think I'll wait for the 3070 reviews before I buy, as I'm not going to be getting a 4K monitor any time soon, so the 3080 loses a bit of its lustre as a result."
"Yeah, I'll probably sit this one out. Especially with the talks of a 20gb model."
I feel like it would be pretty foolish to change your mind with this info...
 I mean... those reviews are all generally positive so why?
"I will still be buying but certainly not tomorrow. I am hoping that at the end of the year I can build a nice Zen 3 - RTX 3080 combination. 

Good luck to everyone buying tomorrow."
"Wait, why would people not want to buy after the reviews? They seem to be mostly glowing and in-line with what NVIDIA said it would do \~2x the performance of the 2080, right?"
"If I had a 2080ti that was serving me well I might hold off to see what the ""super"" cards look like in a year. The gap in performance vs what they paid doesn't seem optimal. Otoh they might just not care about the money and always want top end, so I can see it going either way."
"I was considering holding out for a 3090, but after the reviews I think I may just go for a 3080. Not hype related, but because it looks like the 3080 can do everything I need now. I may wait to buy until next week when I see the 3090 reviews, just to make sure my assessment that the 3090 won't provide some benefit I was not considering is accurate."
"Some results were less than impressive, only 13% over a 2080 Ti in 1 instance I saw. That jump from $700 to $1500 is mighty though. Those that don't need a new GPU immediately (as in, didn't already sell hardware) the smartest path would be to upgrade CPU/mobo soon and wait a few weeks for the higher-end custom AIBs with raised power limits or wait until the 3080 Ti."
"Im stuck with a rx 480 on a recently upgraded 1440 screen and it’s is struggling hard, so I will be looking for 3080 to give me a big jump in performance. 
I can see 2080 users holding off for a bit (maybe until next gen) which I’m happy about because I’m in need of a new card and it will hopefully increases my chance of getting one."
"My 1080 is seeming a little more secure now to be honest. Granted, I was more looking at a 3070."
"(2080 Ti here)

I’m still half and half about tomorrow morning. In some respects, it would really bring a nice bump to my general 4K performance but it’s not pascal levels of “OMG!” in games that I’m playing and plan to be playing.

Also I’ve seen practically no RTX 4K back to back tests with a 2080 Ti (only 1440p tests) which tells me this card still isn’t the killer 4K RTX @ 60 in newer titles that I’ve been waiting for. The 3090 looks like a solid bet but it also may even be a touch overkill.

So I guess I’m leaning away from it now but I’ll definitely be interested to see some of the refreshes next year or even next gen in the following year where Nvidia’s apparently planning to use a much more efficient multi-chip implementation than in previous gens (690) for their next architecture. So yeah, probably one less buyer to compete with!"
"I decided to not be a day-1 buyer based on the reviews.

I currently have a 1080 (non-Ti). There's no question that the 3080 is much, much faster. It's basically double the performance of the 1080.

What I didn't expect fully was that the 3080 basically sits on its 320W power limit all the time. It's not quite double the power consumption of the 1080, but going from 180W to 320W is a big jump.

It's not that the 3080 is a bad card, it's just that NVIDIA's ""performance per watt"" claims don't seem to be relevant to the actual cards. The 3080 is slightly better than 2080, which was slightly better than the 1080.

The 3070 might be better here, but honestly I think I'm going to wait for the RDNA2 reviews. If AMD can really deliver on a 50% performance/watt uplift over the RX 5700XT like they have claimed, they'll be ahead of the RTX 3080. 

I'm a bit skeptical that AMD can actually deliver, but at this point I'm just not blown away by the 3080. If you are in the ""I don't care about heat/power"" crowd, and if you can actually get your hands on a board, you'll probably love the RTX 3080."
2080ti owners cant rest easy. While the salvage value of their card sucks they arent gonna fall behind much.
"As a 2080ti owner I see no point. Raster is only 20-30% better in a majority of games. I would only consider it if there were an over whelming number of DX12 and Ray tracing games available but there just aren't yet so more than likely skipping this gen. I play on a 1440p 240hz monitor, the 3080 might make sense for someone gaming at 4k who loves eye candy so they can guarantee a solid 4k60hz experience. I am interested in seeing what AMD releases as well. Good time to get into PC gaming for sure."
3080 is shiny and tempting but I don't *need* one because my liquid cooled 1080Ti still does a great job at 1440p in 2-3 games I play. Will probably wait for new games and 3080Ti.
"I'll have to wait and see what AMD has to offer then decide what to buy.
Ideally I would wait for cyberpunk testing with Ray tracing but I really want to play it on day 1 so I doubt I can wait.

Also more tests are needed when zen 3 cpus come and hopefully some ray tracing games and of courses crysis remastered."
Think ill wait for the ti
will wait for Ti
"As a 1070Ti owner, this changes nothing. I will be F5-ing tomorrow morning.  I have a 3440x1440 100hz monitor, and want to be able to get that 100hz smoothly.  

My 1070ti gets around 70 in most games, and that 30fps is huge.  Also, I want to try out ray-tracing."
"I was actually hoping to purchase a 3080 and see major 1440p improvements from the 2080. But seeing this now, performance differences might not be worth a whole new purchase after all. Although im excited to see what AMD is going for. 

RDR2 I run above 60fps with most graphic settings on high/ultra. Every other game runs fine as well too. Im not getting triple digit FPS but I also only play Halo3 and R6 Siege competitive so there isn't much improvement there, along with some Squad shenanigans and even then I get a minimum of 90fps at max settings.  

Overall I dont see myself buying it any time soon, I dont see a need in FPS boost nor am I struggling to play anything on 1440p 144hz. MFS2020 is a bit of a struggle but I dont play often. The 3080 is a great purchase for anyone really, but to be reasonable it isn't something I need, yet."
"Its more of a function of what games are in the pipeline. Apart from Cyberpunk 2077, I'm not really excited for anything this year. I'll wait to see how it performs in current gen before deciding early next year."
Yeah maybe 2 minutes now instead of one
I was wanting a pretty consistent 4k 60fps in any game with everything maxed. Seems the 3080 is not going to be able to pull that off. So time to go sell some plasma and get a 3090.
"I just want to add that people that wanted to upgrade from 2080ti to 3080.. you are idiots and not just for that, you also bought overpriced card for over 1K card that couldn't even do 4k 60fps then."
"Underwhelming to be honest, I thought it would actually be 50% faster than the 2080ti. 

Feel bad for all those that got rid of their 2080ti for 600$, they must be scratching their heads rn."
">level 1home\_button76 points · 1 hour agoSo how many people actually changed their minds and decided not to buy after seeing all these reviews? I'm still bu

Great. :D"
"Was always going to happen no matter the price. Its one thing to say your going to buy one, its a totally different ball game to then actually have to pay for one. 

People are happy to be brazen apart from when their money is on the line."
"I bought a 2080ti just last week for 500 including a copper water block. After seeing how close the 1440p performance is I am glad I stuck with the 2080ti. 

Sure the 4k performance is much higher but that means having to first invest in the card, then an investment in a gen4 supported board then investing in a 4k screen that worthy of being kept around for a few years. 

Given my PC can already delivers 165 to 185 with decent setting at 1440p in most games the push for the 3080 really just isn't worth it. 

I will water cool my entire system for quarter of what it would cost to upgrade card, board and screen. Then I will awh in the performance jump the 3090 gives then after I'll Wait idle for another 2 maybe 3 generations role around before I jump ship to that hardware."
Yeah I saw that. I'll still add his AIB review later on.
Dang! I was waiting for someone to show how it works in an ITX build!
"Ouch, I wonder why. Maybe a sign the reference designs don't work well in small cases?"
"Jay and Linus both mention it.

TL;DW:
Previous cards have always heated up the temps of the CPU and RAM, so does the 3080 FE, but its turning out that its heating them less than previous cards due to a slicker airflow. (Not by a significant amount)

Basically, CPU/RAM temp increases from this FE are null."
"I didn't post [the results](https://babeltechreviews.com/rtx-3080-arrives-ampere-performance-revealed-35-games-benchmarked/view-all/), but there was no effect (I could determine) on the CPU temp in a very well cooled Phanteks Eclipse P400 ATX mid-tower (plus 1 Noctua 140mm fan).

All my benchmarking and overclocking performed with the case closed and the i9-10900K at 5.0/5.1GHz temps didn't rise above what is usual."
Linus' review touched on this
Linus has. Watch his review. It isn't bad.
2klicksphilip did.
"Looking for this information as well and turning up little to nothing. I guess most reviewers just had it on a test bench or use AIO which are much more popular now. The linus example doesn't give any useful context so its not a reliable source.

I have the Phanteks P400A as well and I'm adding an additional 120mm exhaust at the top rear to cope with the extra heat!"
Same boat for me. 970 ran Witcher 3 3440x1440 for me fine.. but I want Cyberpunk maxed out baby
"I'm crossing my fingers and setting my alarm clock. On a side note, I think it's pretty funny when all these people are comparing to 2080's and and 2080ti's commenting that the improvements are ""marginal"" but I'm looking at the difference between my 1080 and the 3080 and it's just staggering how much of an improvement it will be. I'm pretty excited."
Is it 6am pst?
"I'll be saying goodbye to my 1060 6gb. It was awsome, but I cant say I'm going to miss it with this upgrade lol"
"Was a bit frustrating to have to toggle settings to keep VRAM usage down, but goddammit you got me into PC gaming and that's all i can ask for"
going from 3770k + gtx 1080 to 10900k + rtx 3080 is going to be so great.
"F. Amazing card, gave it away to a good home for MOBAs and CSGO."
"I have a 1060 6GB, looking to see what they come out with in the $300 price range. Though, frankly, if used 2070s go cheap enough, I'm perfectly happy with that level of performance."
I'll be saying goodbye to my 980ti. Will feelgoodman.
I have not enjoyed mine because I got 1440p monitor and life has been rough. Been looking for good upgrade for some time. Super excited to hand my 1060 3gb down.
I wonder if my i5 8600 will be the bottle neck now
">VR

That's what I'm looking for, would love some vr benches."
"Ars Technica's review doesn't have hard quantitative VR benchmarks but did offer this experience:

>I can say this: with the RTX 3080, you can run Elite Dangerous at its ""high"" preset in VR, flip to 120Hz mode in Valve Index, and expect a nearly locked framerate. The same goes for Fallout 4 VR, a brutally unoptimized VR conversion of Bethesda's RPG, which I can finally run at a locked 90fps (or hover in variable 100-110fps territory on Valve Index). Three years after that VR port's launch, I actually want to play it that way."

My 1080 runs at 80 under 100% fans anyway and the power isn't a problem to me. I too feel like its a worthy upgrade for my 1440p 144hz.
"I was going to wait for a 3070, but these reviews kind of sketched out performance promises for me."
I had crossfire 7990s. Luckily I live in Finland where it's cold 90% of the year. 750W TDP just from graphics cards.
"My main concern right now is how much it would heat up my room, it gets a bit warm with a card drawing 175W reported by GPU-Z. Can anyone give me an idea of how much more heat an extra ~145W would cause?"
I'm not seeing a heat issue here.
"Ah yes, it's like being part of a special group, I once benchmarked metro on my sli 480's and i7 950@4.5ghz all on water and I had 980w from the wall using a corsair hx1000 accounting for efficiency, that's still massive."
I never realized that a lot of these Techspot reviews were written by Steve from Hardware Unboxed!
"Yup, this is exactly what some people predicted.

The 1080p numbers for the 3070 will be interesting to see"
"I'm assuming a 3700x will not be a bottle neck right? Planning on a 3080 for my 3700x build with 1440p/144hz

Edit: looking at the results I think I'll be happy with performance."
Was wondering the same
"Ars technica doesn't have numbers for it but they posted their experience in E:D and FO4VR:

>I can say this: with the RTX 3080, you can run Elite Dangerous at its ""high"" preset in VR, flip to 120Hz mode in Valve Index, and expect a nearly locked framerate. The same goes for Fallout 4 VR, a brutally unoptimized VR conversion of Bethesda's RPG, which I can finally run at a locked 90fps (or hover in variable 100-110fps territory on Valve Index). Three years after that VR port's launch, I actually want to play it that way."
I pre ordered a g2. I think it’ll be able to do 4k 90fps probably fairly well. Especially with dlss 2.0
"It's not maturity of software, it's just throughput."
That's what I want most
Dang those are some spicy jumps
"I'm first going to hold out and see what the 3090 review entails, otherwise I think I'll wait 6 months for the 3080ti to release to finally move on from my 1080ti.

The 3080 already looks great at 1440p/VR for me right now so they'll look even better!

Wonder when the 3090 review drops?"
[deleted]
How come? I’m Currently considering the FE model myself from a 1080ti.
"The FE edition by all account is the best designed cooler for the 3080. It's costs nvidia $150 to make per card. I'm telling you now the AIBs cards are gonna be hotter, louder and more expensive than the FE's."
"Looking out for the TI/Supers ?

Edit: forgot AIB cards were a thing and I’m guessing that’s what you’re going with"
I want to use HDMI 2.1 on my LG C9. 4k 120hz HDR 10 bit without chroma subsampling is one of the main reasons for me to upgrade from my 2080Ti to a 3080. The performance increase alone wouldn't make it worth it for me.
I do a lot of blender and it’s almost 100% faster in rendering
It is truly safe to upgrade for us Pascal owners lol. My 1080 had a good run. I'll give it to my cousin when I upgrade.
"sorry but how would the price to performance not make sense? the 3080 is 20-30% better than the 2080 Ti for significantly cheaper, just not sure what you meant by that. (i am in canada as well and yah the canadian prices really hurt :P)"
"One of the best youtubers out there, maybe a little behind Sseth"
"

They lied to us. There were never any to buy"
Jenson told you it was safe
\o/
*cough*
"This plus the one review that stated that they heard some coil whine is pushing me towards an AIB. Looks like for sure the power limit will define your overall OC ability, so unless you get a unit that runs well undervolted your headroom is pretty limited. You're stuck with the power limit with FE, no way around that. People that don't OC won't care about that though."
why did they only push the fan to 54%?
[https://wccftech.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-10-gb-ampere-graphics-card-review/12/](https://wccftech.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-10-gb-ampere-graphics-card-review/12/)
"It went from ""Notify Me"" to ""Out of Stock"" on the nvidia shop a minute after launch. Fucking insane."
"I’ve found theirs to be the most interesting. 

Shows pcie 4.0 vs 3.0 tests, Intel vs Ryzen, VRAM limiting in DOOM, and talks about 4k vs 1440p architecture gains. Overall excellent review."
"Good review but he seems eager to display the card in a bad light. I'm neither an Nvidia nor AMD fanboy, and I've had GPUs from both within the last year. There's something off about this guy to me. I don't know..."
"Yeah, this is what I need. Right now Im just assuming that the 3090 is going to be a better fit with double the Vram."
"I couldn't find anything either.  Sort of crazy, as 3080 will probably really shine compared to previous generations in VR benches.  On a valve index 2x super sampling is roughly equivalent to a 6k display, with 130% more pixels."
"Here's someone doing an undervolt instead of power limit:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1B4qZFDpYE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1B4qZFDpYE)

52W lower power (345.6 vs 293.6) for same performance."
This bodes well for my 600W PSU since scalpers want $300 for the 750W variant. Cries in SFFPC.
"that's fair, but the fact that this is even a thing is the problem... obviously, ""some companies"" knew this was going to be VERY limited in quantity which is why such scripts are ran out of necessity.

i guarantee many more people wait for the latest iphone to be available for purchase than they do for a $700 graphics card - wonder why iphone customers don't have this issue.

release the product when you have enough to stave off scalpers; otherwise, it's simply as good as a proof of concept for the majority of us."
Definitely go for the 3070! It’s going to be a huge upgrade for you and at 1080p you won’t see any big gain from getting a 3080.
"Wait for the 3070 or even 3060, unless you have some high refresh monitor you’ll be wasting money getting a 3080 tbh

3080 is for 4K or 1440p 144Hz, save that extra $200 by waiting for a 3070 then use those savings to upgrade your monitor"
"Unless you've got like a 240hz+ 1080p eSports monitor, the 3070 should be more than enough for you. Almost every game reviewed at 1080p with max graphics settings were CPU limited."
From my understanding 3080 would be overkill for 1080p not that you shouldn't get it if you wanted too but the question is if you would want to spend $200 extra versus a 3070 that should be perfect for 1080p
"I mean, get a new monitor. That's really the important thing."
I think it really depends on the CPU
Not quite right. IgorsLab has measured peaks and he recommends 750W to not get limited.
What did you replace it with?
"I will admit I skimmed a lot of these reviews, but did it say somewhere that 650W would be fine?

I have a 650W PSU right now that I'd rather not upgrade if I don't have to."
If you were getting an AIB board with 3 x 8 pin connectors and your PSU didn't have 3 gpu support (3 separate 8 pin outputs) then you may have had to upgrade any ways.
“ONLY” like 30% isn’t a good jump specially if u just want stable 4K
That's what I like to hear. No one buy the 3080 it sucks /s
"it's not 25-30% better, more like 15% better if we're talking about OCed 2080ti vs OCed 3080"
That's exactly what they promised though
First mistake is comparing a 3080 to a 2080ti. The 3080 is base version just as a 2080 is base version. ti is different.
"I have a 2080, the software features were definitely pushing me to along with “double performance”, but after reviews I think I can wait a year. Next release we should have games taking advantage of these features. Besides Cyberpunk I can’t even think of a next gen game releasing in the fall I’m hyped for now that Halo 6 was delayed"
Don't You get software features on 20 series too?
Thought the software features were all RTX?
"This is the really funny part of all these 2080ti memes. People are giving y'all shit but the card is still incredibly powerful and will be plenty for the majority of upcoming games. Percentages always have a wow-factor to them, but it's funny how people quiet down once they understand what that means in terms of true in-game FPS. All of a sudden that nutty 25% increase translates into only like 15-20fps in higher-end titles and spending hundreds of dollars doesn't seem so sexy anymore lmao."
"My rule of thumb is only upgrade if it's 75% minimum better in something meaningful. Even at 4K you're only looking at 30%. You'll barely feel that. Maybe if you got a great price for your 2080 ti so it's basically a free upgrade, but otherwise wait until the next gen."
"i think the only reason you wouldnt upgrade from a 2080 ti is simply bc of what you spent.

if you spent the normal amount im pretty sure we wouldnt have this discussion. going from a 2080 ti to a 3080 seems reasonable to me in terms of performance gains."
"As a 2060s owner I’m right on the edge of wanting to upgrade, but not needing to immediately. I’ll ride the 2nd wave of availability if my 8700k struggles with Watchdogs Legion at 1080p with RTX/DLSS on"
I'm actually considering biting the bullet and springing for the 3090 instead. Metro Exodus was a bummer to run on a 2080 at 4k. 3080 only bumps you to 70fps with RTX off. I *really* want a tits out experience for cyberpunk.
"GTX 1080 at 1440p / 144 Hz.

I never really was looking at the 3080, only the 3070. I'm concerned that the 3070 will actually be a big enough jump to justify moving to at this point."
"Going from a 2080ti to 3080 for \~$250 is definitely not bad. Maybe not if you only count performance, but you get extra features and a fresh warrenty."
Getting 30% better performance at 4k for $200 is pretty good.
"Who cares, it is their money - their business."
RIP to upgrading from a 2080ti to a 3080 for $300 bucks if not less?
"Well selling it was kinda stupid, but at the same time its not worth more.

Remember this isnt a 3080ti. And its 30% better. And cheaper."
"The high end ones will be superior. The FE is quite power limited, that's why the clocks fluctuate everywhere.

The AIBs that can sustain more power will already get a sustained consistent boost."
We haven't seen it so far
"To a massively lesser degree, evga's ftw version appears to have some through holes to reduse recirc, so they're trying."
"I doubt it.  Even though the FE has decent cooling, there's a reason no AIB went with only 2 fans."
"> refreshing since 8:55, never got a slowdown but at 9:04 it flippe

Thats what I am saying, they never had any in stock. Just a notice so I didn't have to waste my time would have been lovely."
Sadly I think alot of us are unlucky that it didnt turn over on our end immediately. Was refreshing as well since 8:55 but it broke immediately and flipped at 9:04 for me as well
"honestly i wouldnt expect a big difference. people are forgetting nvidia did not use reference design here. for all intents and purposes the FE is an AIB.

youre going to have to probably spend a good $100-200 to see any real diff if overclocking.

could be wrong, but we're talking about a non reference design and new unique style cooler nvidia is using. i just dont see why 90% of AIB would be any better."
"The super-abridged summary:

It's good; AIB's could have an edge in OC certain situations, which honestly isn't different than any other generation."
"Sorry for being ignorant but FE is founders edition, right? what is AIB"
"That’s where I am at..

Although, the only AIB I think worth getting that is actually releasing is the MSI gaming x trio. EVGA ftw and Asus strix aren’t even releasing tomorrow."
Are the AIB reviews still restricted? I'm not seeing them anywhere.
"FE board appears to have basically no overhead for OC, thanks to the power limits baked into BIOS.

Some of the AiBs may have more overhead, but we won't know which until they get reviewed."
"FE if you dont OC, AiB if you want to OC"
"If you're the type of person to go for as much force out of a GPU as you can get go AIB. If you're fine with crushing everything with stock speeds you dont need an AIB, unless of course FE sells out."
"FE for sure. AIB cards tend to be more expensive and the lower tier cards are the worst binned cards.

FE cards tend to be cherry picked by nvidia and binned well.

So for AIB your paying more for a worse binned card with the hope that the cooler design makes up for it. And for lower tier AIB cards I don’t think the coolers will be up to par.

Only makes sense if you’re gonna get a top of the line AIB, but then it’s gonna cost $850 ish or more and at that point the extra performance you may get isn’t even worth the extra $."
Agreed. A 3070 would probably be better value for 1440 and below.
What if I’m doing 3440x1440?
"Haven't had time to watch reviews yet.  At 1080p I assume it can hit 60/144 ?

I do have a vive and I do plan on getting a new display, so I'd rather get a card that I can upgrade into instead of out of.

I'm coming from a 1080 not ti, so it's def worth the money"
"Yah it's crazy. best buy and nvidia are sold out instantly, and newegg isnt  even working"
They never had any in stock. Its a sham. They have just wasted thousands of peoples time.
"I haven't gotten the buy option yet. Still only ""send me mail"" thingy"
Yup
"same here. Had my phone and pc refreshing. Hit the massive slowdown at 9 am, ""Coming soon"" still there. Eventually it disappeared all together"
[deleted]
"The geforce twitter is going nuts right now, no one seems to even have landed one."
"Because digital foundry used 2080ti and 2080 for their review, wouldnt an upgrade from the 2070 super be about 50%? I'm just spitballing for discussion"
Same
"Same. Don't even have a 4K monitor so I feel like that jump from a 2070 Super to a 3080 JUST for 1440p is kind of a waste. That isn't to say it's a bad card by any means. I think if you're rocking like a 1060, this is it. Think the performance for the price point is a game changer. But for me personally and with what I got already? idk. Just not seeing enough to justify the purchase of one over keeping a 2070 Super."
"Yeah. My 2070S runs everything I want fine. This one looks great, but honestly, I wouldn’t notice the difference if I upgraded.

The only game I want more performance is flight simulator, and I need to see how it runs after some optimization. Right now I’m a bit limited by the single core thread performance."
"Which part are you not impressed specifically? 

I am OK with the performance (so, still impressive) and definitely offers a lot of value now buying GPU at 700USD range for the performance it can offer especially considering how crazy it was with the high end of the the RTX20-series but at the same time I am disappointed about the power figures (performance/watt)"
"I'm going to go the other way with my 2070S, but that's mostly because I upgraded to an ultrawide monitor and am pushing nearly 4k now.  Between that and 4k VR, the 2070S is going to be a limitation.  Totally understand for others that it isn't the right choice!  If I were on a 1440p display, I don't think upgrading so soon makes that much of a difference..."
70% faster isn't impressive enough for you?
"980Ti owner here :O

Congrats to us, fellow gamer-holding-up-several-generations-gfx-card-before-upgrading!"
going from my 970 to this will be super duper insane lol
"ive got an r9 390, lmao im really hoping i can get a FE"
imagine a 1060 XD
Yes.
"From the known spec differences, probably around 15-20% faster than 3080. Rough educated guess (~20% more CUDA cores but slower base and boost clocks)

Extra VRAM probably matters quite a lot in 8K. And maaaaaybe in 4K in some specific games."
"Just as I suspected, the 4080 is going to be the 4k killer."
Can you tell me the resolution I could use to reach 3080 1440p FPS on my R9-390 pls tks
"I've known since day 1 3090 was the only card I would be looking at my 2080ti already is 15-20% faster than stock 2080ti.

This card is grate but it's an a absolute side grade for me and since I got $1100 for my 2080ti a month ago I might as well spend the extra $400 and get some real gains!"
What about a 2070 super
"lol im on the same boat, idk if i want this or a 3090"
"I wouldn't call you crazy but I'd honestly say it might not be worth it if you can upgrade other things on your system like going for a higher res or higher refresh monitor, going ultrawide (1600p ones are really enticing for example), etc. So you can get a refresh card next year or when the next gen launches."
Not really; it’s a substantial boost. With the resale value of a 2080 factored in it’s not *that* expensive if you’re a working person.
lol. I'm on a 980 ti and contemplating...
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwT-eU3T9D0&ab_channel=jackfrags

Jackfrags has his Warzone play in his video.  Seems to run it on high settings at 1440p really well."
"Apex was getting 160fps on wide-screen 1440p. Will get the yt video and post it here in a sec

Update: https://youtu.be/bhBVJe3BASI benchmarks start at 11.30. Dude thinks it's a pc build video but last 5 minutes he's benchmarking games in ultra wide 1440p"
"I run Warzone with max details at 1440p and the fps hover around 90 to 110. Some drops to low 80s but I'm running all details and DXR (RTX) on. This is with a Zotac 2080 Amp, non Super.

For this kind of games and resolution you could look to 3070 reviews if you're not in a hurry or get the 3080 but you could reach 144hz with current cards if running medium or custom settings. So it's all about needs and budget imo."
Same exact boat. Pretty exciting
"Same, but I am upgrading from a 980ti"
The cooler is not great. It pushes hot air onto your CPU cooler and RAM.
"Everyone ignores the part where they say ""up to"". With proper optimization it should become more common"
"Once optimization kicks in via drivers and game updates, the gap will increase.

The problem's that monstrous power draw. 100w is actually a lot."
"Really? Current card is a Gigabyte Windforce OC 1080, and it's not quiet at all when it revs up. You think the lower tier Asus/MSI will be quieter than FE?"
the 3090 is for 0.01% of consumers
"3080 is more than enough, spend the extra on a nice monitor or NVME drive or something is my recommendation"
Save your money. The only people who really need the 3090 are going to be doing computational work on the card.
"For gaming, the diff isnt worth the price.  Its not meant to be a gaming card, its the new Titan which is for stuff that needs gobs of ram and CUDA.

3080 is the way to go, or wait to see if rumors of 3080/3080ti with 20gb pan out"
Thanks for the responses everyone much appreciated :)
Get a 3080 and upgrade to a new 1440p high refresh monitor since it ends up in total being around the same $ cost as the 3090. I had the same exact dilemma and just picked up a Samsung G7. Absolutely zero regrets and am stoked to replace my 1080 with a 3080 to push it to the limits.
"I think if you have a 1080Ti, it might still work well enough with Ryzen 4000. Perhaps in 6 months 3080Ti will drop with price and performance somewhere in between 3080 and 3090."
yep.
There's no reason to assume anything about AMD other than hope.
Pretty much yea.
Psu is way too weak.
"This is hard to explain, but Nvidia tried with their graph. Power-Consumption-To-Performance is not linear. If you set the 2080TI and the 3080 to the same FPS in a particular game, there would be a maximum of 1.9x more power being used for the 2080ti to make the same FPS.

&#x200B;

In a scenario where the 3080 used exactly 50% more power for 50% more FPS would be indicative of a relatively large increase in efficiency, actually. Take CPUs for example, the i7 10700 non-k will hold around 3.9 ghz all 8 cores when limited to its 65w power target, but will boost up to 4.8 and pull up to 330w sustained. That's a frequency increase of 23% and a power consumption increase of 507%?

&#x200B;

Also, the 2080ti had bios that would allow the default 250 watt target to pull around 350 watts, and the FPS increase with those OCs was no where near 50%, like the power consumption was.

&#x200B;

This is what Nvidia was saying."
Watch Gamers Nexus part on Power/Performance. It's more efficient.
Ehmm it is.
"My main concern too. I like how Digital Foundry mentions about ""Brute Force"". The performance seems impressive, nice, yes, but at huge extra costs of power.

I am personally curious like why it seems more difficult like to gain more perf/watt improvement in GPU technically than in CPU (relatively speaking)? Is it just NVidia architecture/design already at the max edge of the perf/watt or is there any other reason? just super curious if anyone outside like us can have an educated guess/analysis."
">This looks impressive but it's definitely not the card it was touted out to be. The power consumption is pretty disappointing. I have faith in AMD.

Yeah what was the touted perf/watt increase? Looks like it's what.. 50% perf/watt gain best case scenario? Other scenarios, much less? Like 15-20%?  Worst case, it's a regression?

Uses 50% more power than a FE 2080ti for not 50% more fps?"
Are you running a data center full of these?  Why do you care so much about power consumption?
"NVIDIA Engineer probably: ""I bought a 750W PSU so I'm gonna USE my 750 watts"""
It's worth mentioning that there is a large enough population of those of us in PC gaming with cheap power that we don't really even consider power consumption relevant.
"It's exactly what they touted it to be. ""Up to"" X in performance, which it does do sometimes. It's twice as efficient in power, at power levels the old cards used...but it goes much higher for much higher performance and doesn't scale well in that."
"> AMD, please deliver.

Considering the 3080 is only sucking 50W more than the 5700XT yet is 100% (2x) as fast - doubt.

AMD is claiming they're getting about a 60% improvement per watt with RDNA2. A bit of simple math shows us RDNA2 just isn't as efficient as Ampere, so either AMD will have to ramp power draw way up, or accept lower performance.

Leaks are putting Big Navi between the 3070 and 3080, but closer to the 3070. That makes sense with what we're seeing."
"awe thats cute, they care about the little guy"
You have to remember that a lot of these guys have to return the cards and they are just review samples.
Is the FE cooler good in temps or noise?  I want the quietest 3080 but have no idea without sub reviews whether that's going to be FE or AIB.
You may want to go with AIBs due to better power delivery. Seems like FE is limited in power.
It's not really cpu bottlenecks as much as ampere's architecture being geared towards higher resolutions and bandwidth. 1440p results seem disappointing across the board. Maybe in newer games we'll see those gaps increase again as the newer engines become more demanding
"These extra FP32 units in 3080 allow for faster pixel shading, however, at 1440p (2K) the pixel shading time fraction of the frame is ~2.3 times smaller than that of 2160p (4K). That's why the improvement at 1440p isn't as great as that at 2160p. 

That smaller improvement at 1440p isn't caused by CPU bottleneck."
what about DLSS at 1440p from 1080p I guess ? Would this be caught in the 1080p bottleneck ? And 4k DSR on 1440p ?
"What? Small increase in 1440p is the problem that was not expected vs ocd 2080tis.in 4k its a nice jump, but most peolle game at 1440p or 1080p. People where saying 30procent plus performance jump... In 1440p its between 7 and 15procent. 
 
This card is an insane jump for people still on the 1000series or lower 2000series card."
That’s ok. More for me. Coming from a 1080ti
The cards are impressive at 4k but 1440p performance is 30% better than the 2080ti. Hardly any reason to upgrade if you're on a top end Turing card
"Shhh let it happen, man. More stock for us lol"
"Honestly a fair number of those are probably people a little sour that they massively overpaid for the 2080 Ti. It was not a great card in price-performance ratio, and we've got something 20% - 30% faster at \~60% of the price."
Next week according to Ryan
Which review you are getting that? Hardware Unboxed absolutely no significant difference between 10900k and 3950x.
Um no. The claim was that the 3070 will be the same as the 2080 ti not the 3080.
"Your wrong.. They said the 3070would provide the same performsnce as the 2080ti. 
The 3080 vs a ocd 2080ti in 1440p isnt much faster..anywhere between 7 and 15procent it seems. In 4k its a nice 20procent+
 
Thats the problem with stating a percentage without resolution. Its not the same over the whole board.
 
Thats why peolle are wondering how the 3070is going to live up to that statement."
They said that about the 3070 not 3080
Just.. never listen to reddit. It's really simple. People on this site are fucking stupid.
"Nvidia claimed the 3070 would be 2080 Ti levels. Now we are seeing the 3080 barely outdo the 2080 Ti by no more than 10% at BEST. Meaning the 3070 will fall behind the 2080 Ti by a significant margin. 

So Ampere is kind of a disappointment."
Seriously...
Techgage may be the best place to look.  I have only skimmed the reviews.
Wondering as well

"GN's video is the most detail I've seen so far. I think most places don't want to put out all their data at once; 30 minutes seems to be the cutoff for most.

I was able to compare GN's data for the FE to my current card by checking [their website](https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/2487-msi-gtx-1080-gaming-x-review-and-overclocking-benchmark/page-3) though."

Tomorrow the reviews for the partners go live apparently
"I literally built my new i9-9900K system 5-6 months ago (March), but kept my good old 980Ti waiting for Ampere. Best choice I've ever made!"

"Looks like toms hardware did a few. I don't think they did a 6700k. I would imagine that more comparisons will come in the next few days.

"5820k here haha, although im running a 980ti at the moment  on 1440-p 144hz, so i'll obviously have some noticeable gains regardless. Will probs just pick up a 10600k later in the year if i can"
I have a 6600 :(
"The 3080 reviews were originally supposed to be out on the 14th, but were delayed due to shipping issues with the preview cards.

The 3090 and 3070 still may be on their original 72 hour preview schedule."
I dont think they were allowed to tear it apart to find out.
"Agreed, my 2080 ti gets 185-210 fps on MW ( with some pointless graphics turned down) with ease, not even overclocked further (I have the strix 2080 ti) think it sits at 58-62 degrees Celsius too lmao. All the way up I get about 130-140 fps. Unless I spent the money on an insane monitor the upgrade just isn’t what they made it seem to be at 1440p.."
"I had one of those until I got my 970 in 2015 (which I still have). Props for still rocking that bad boy, I thought I'd held on well."
Someone at Nvidia in their discord server said yes.
Yes
"They dont. Which is why no one should buy those.

There were no pre-orders offered."
Do not fall for stupid scams.
7700k is aging
not really you should be more then fine. unless you play at 1080 p and want max fps (120) on triple aaa high demanding then your cpu might slow your frame rate just little. but 2k 4k your golden
It says OOS on BB and NE so its no bamboozle
"

Round one needs to turn up first, we just got conned into generating release hype for a product that hasn't been released."
Which website?
I'm glad I am not the only one! I never expected 100% better performance in all scenarios and based on reviews they're seeing 90% increases at 4k.
I though everybody already knew that it was up to 2x performance... at 4k in rtx and dlss scenarios. Expecting 2x increase in rasterization just means you weren't paying attention.
Curious why are you getting a 3080 and a 3090?
gotta catch em all?
Can I have your wife/bank account?
For the 20 series release I think nzxt didn't include new gpu series for a week? Unless I'm remembering incorrectly.
Build it yourself!
Pinned message (the other one not this one)
"~~6AM EST~~

Edit: for founders edition anyway. Lmk if you find any info about AIB release times.

Edit 2: Whoops, apparently it's 9 AM EST, 6 AM PST."
Start at midnight eastern and keep refreshing every 15 seconds from there
"I'll probably do something similar to what I did last time and go 3080-3080TI depending on performance difference, and skip 40** series.  It's about the same $$$ as buying a 3090 upfront, but not as much all at once."
"You can't look at temps alone these days. Most of these cards push as hard as they can up to the temperature or power limit with Boost clocks.

The new cooler is a lot better because it's dissipating a lot more heat since the card is using more power and the temps aren't too much higher."
The other pinned post has useful pictures showing you the measurements
"Im curous about this aswell! Usually AIBs have superiour temp and noise, but now Im not so sure."
"The temp of the card is controlled by how efficient the heatsink is in taking the heat energy generated by the card and dumping it into your room. The better it is at dumping the heat into your room (either directly or via the case), the lower the card temps.

You eventually reach an equilibrium where your pc is at a constant temp which means that heat generated by components = heat into your room.

One way to think about this is increasing the fan speed on a card. If you increase the fan speed (or add more fans like the FTW3), you decrease the card temps. Where did that energy go? Into your room heating it up.

Basically, the AIBs will likely have cooler/quieter cards but the energy generated by them will be the same or greater."
"I think we will see more of this with the 3090, but yes, it's all about gaming with the 3080's it seems"
"You should watch the Hardware Canucks review, they tested it with a i7-7700K."
the game is capped at 60fps anyway.......the physics implode if you go above.
"Tbh not really worth it, your build is already pretty good I’d say wait for the super or something of this series"
"It does! Or at least everything is waayy smoother now, somehow"
"I didn't sell, but i will be waiting for 3080ti/super. 20-30% more speed really doesn't ruffle my feathers, and 2k/4k performance really isn't jaw dropping."
That depends on what fps target you have in mind...then check if the 3080 reaches that. If not then then3090 is your only choice.
Ryan has a lot of stuff going on. Check out his tweet up top!
I'll still go for 1440p 144hz - maybe later on I'll buy a 4k so i can swap between the two.
Check out [Computerbase.de](https://Computerbase.de) review on the power. They undervolted it all the way down to 270w and barely lost any performance.
"keep a eye on used 2000 series.

i got a gpu dirt cheap and it was used for 6 months.(had recpait)"
"For a second I thought you meant you don't need as much RAM then I realized you meant VRAM, I was like fuck I just bought 32 GBs of ram for nothing"
I think the games need to be designed with that in mind so I don't think we will see the benefit of that just yet
"I would not do that. Required PSU is 750W and we've stressed using two modular cables with the 12-pin adapter that is shipped with the FE. There's a quick image explainer at the link below regarding the modular cables.

[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080/?nvmid=systemcomp ](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080/?nvmid=systemcomp)  


For power connector adapters, we recommend you use the 12-pin dongle that already comes with the RTX 3080 GPU. However, there will also be excellent modular power cables that connect directly to the system power supply available from other vendors, including Corsair, EVGA, Seasonic, and CableMod. Please contact them for pricing and additional product details."
"at 1080p, probably.  At 1440p maybe?  At 4k, no."
"Same here. I am hyped for the FE's performance but I can't help to think there's room for improvement in the Power Consumption + OC margins. FE's cards seem to be great but not for OC.

Not sure if I should pick FE or wait for AIB cards which could deliver better thermal/power/cooling performance.

(coming from my 980Ti both options will be a huuuuge improvement, and yet, picking the better deal it's always, well, better)"
GN said sometime today
"The connector was used to minimise board space taken up by having two 8 pin PCIE connectors, allowed them to design a more compact PCB to facilitate their new cooling solution.

If you're getting a FE you'll need to use the adapter cable"
"You'll be waiting a while. AMD's rumoured IPC increase with Zen 3 will only put them around intel 10xxx performance and intel have dropped the ball in terms of progression.

We might see better framerates as games leverage more cores with the new consoles coming out but I wouldn't expect massive gains for a while"
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwT-eU3T9D0&ab_channel=jackfrags

Jackfrags shows his warzone fps at 1440p and he's pretty steady above 144"
Who knows? Based on previous launches you're going to want to be ready but if you're there and reasonably fast you should be fine (within the first few minutes of launch depending on the website).
"It's just personal preference, but I have a 1080TI now and I'll buy a 3080 when I can (for maxing out Cyberpunk mostly), then upgrade to the 3080*S/TI* later when they're out since I like to skip every other generation.  If you've already got a 2080TI waiting for the 3080*S/TI* definitely makes sense if you buy a new card every generation."
"Another user above you pointed out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1B4qZFDpYE) where a 52w undervolt saw basically negligible drops in performance. 

Its going to be a good while before any kind of overclocking will be worth it."
"Upgrading from anything under a 2080 super, is going to be great."
Yes.
"RDR2 is just poorly optimized. There are plenty of benchmarks, the difference is not that amazing for this specific game."
"Depends if the 2080S isn't enough for you anymore. If you have the CPU to drive it, if there are games that you're not quit getting in the 120-144 FPS sweetspot and the splash of cash is worth it to you.

I wouldn't consider it a huge upgrade, but ultimately it comes down to if its worth the cash to you."
I'd say pass and wait for the Ti/Super. 2080 Super is nothing to scoff at.
on the same boat
"I’m gonna try MSI and if sold out go FE. 

But I also prob won’t OC my card so prob should just go FE"
"I would think it would be a waste of money unless you are planning on upgrading your monitor. If you're looking at 3070, you should really be looking into a 1440p 144hz monitor"
Sounds like we're making the same upgrade.
"Target temperature in BIOS is set to around 75 degrees with around 40db noise. Make of it what you will, it's all very relative to your particular case and other fans."
It’ll depend on what we see next week from the 3090. I think we can expect the Ti version to be just under the half way point between the 80 and 90. My 2¢.
Honestly unless you are 4K gaming I would say go for 3080 and use the $800 to upgrade future parts / monitor.
I have almost all of them listed :)
AIB reviews come out tomorrow.
Review embargo until tomorrow at launch.
It makes me salivate.
6am PDT/9am EST
"It is 1 per customer. Hopefully thats per payment method and Nvidia store account, and not just one or the other."
"No, rather than a mid-tier upgrade and slapping a 4000 number on it, they will likely do another Super line of mid-life refresh cards.

Leaving the 4000 label for what ever new architecture comes after Ampere."
how does the value fade?  the 3080 is almost half the price!
">limited stock?

They will probably not have enough on hand to meet the immediate demand, so sure.

>As in, eventually they stop selling them?  If so how long until they stopped selling 20XX FEs?

They only stopped *producing* the 20 Series RTX cards last month. You can even still find new ones in stock. They wont stop with this line until the next version launches."
"Mine in Bay Area, ca says yes. Just call your local store"
"1080ti myself at 1440p ultrawide and still doing fine. Honestly I prob won't upgrade till 4k ultra wide high res panel is a thing or cheap. 

Worse case, I just pick up a used 2080ti for <500 if really want to improve my 1440 experience a bit till new panels are cheap enough to justify upgrading."
Literally just allows you to overclock while the non-OC models are locked
Nvidia got back to Ryan Smith at Anandtech and the answer is a no.
"What are you talking about? At 1440p, Ultra settings, there's [only 15fps difference](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjH64YYWhFEoMuQivCurKf-1920-80.png) between the best system and i3-10100 (which they say has the same performance as a 6700k). So while there will be a 12% difference, 6700k is absolutely not fucked.

I have the same CPU and I would rather enjoy the 3080 now while saving money for a new system in the slightly distant future."
"You know there's Zen3 coming soon, right?"
"Right, there are no public drivers; but that may change tomorrow. Im not sure anyone mentioned if they were running the existing driver version or if they had preview builds."
[https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/msi-rtx-3080-gaming-x-trio.b7957](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/msi-rtx-3080-gaming-x-trio.b7957)
No one knows because AiB's aren't out yet.
"At 1440p, most likely yes."
Why not just buy one and if it’s bad just cancel it?
"You can go up to a 9900k/ks, which would be the best in socket. but if you can get a cheap 9700k it wouldn't be a bad option either.

The issue is that both are still really expensive despite the 10 series being out.

Depending on your upgrade budget you may be better off waiting for the newer AMD/Intel offerings to be revealed in the coming months."
Both are. Not sure what that other guy is talking about.
"¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

NDA doesnt lift until the FE cards launch, it could be the same time; it could be later in the day or even week."
"https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator

Likely not."
"I'm in the mindset of if you have $700 for a graphics card, you have $100-$170 for a good quality 750W-850W PSU for peace-of-mind"
"https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator

It would be fine for a 3070, but with a 3080 youre looking at less MUCH less than 100w of headroom. 

you would need to figure out how much you have remaining. Under 50w should basically be a no-go."
You can always upgrade your CPU and monitor at a later date :)
"A decent 165Hz 1440p monitor that drives the 3080 well will set you back about $450. Mobo plus cpu let's say... $400-500?

You'll still get great results at 1080p, especially for RTX games, so I'd go with it if I was planning on dropping another $1000 to bring it to parity."
Ye
If the deliveries are on schedule it will be the 21st.
The 23rd.
"Nvidia accounts and Nvidia store accounts are separate. Which is why you cant set that information before hand.

If you buy something now, you can set that account up; but that's a $25 t-shirt at minimum. 

You can use paypal checkout or just checkout as a guest to get around that."
"EVGA; Followed by Zotac, MSI or Gigabyte.

EVGA offers a step-up program, so if there really is a 20GB 3080 laying in wait for AMD's announcement; you could upgrade to a newer/better RTX 30 model within 90 days of purchase by only paying the difference.

I haven't had experience with most of the other AIB brands launching."
"`2560 * 1440 = 3686400`

`3840 * 1080 = 4147200`

I'm not even sure if these numbers are directly comparable, but your monitor has more pixels than a 1440p monitor. 12.5% more. Also remember that you'll see higher performance gains at higher resolutions with these cards, so you'll probably see little bit more of a gain on your monitor vs. a 1440p one.

Could be totally wrong, this is not my field, at all."
Do you know when the 3070 will be available for preorder?
you will get an amazing boost in performance at 2 k keep[ your screen go for 3080 the 1080ti will only do 25% beter but 3080 will be at least 3 times better
"I believe displayport to dual link DVI active adapters exist at a semi reasonable price (Like $30). I found at least one on amazon though it didn't exactly have 5 star reviews. A generic adapter that isn't dual link won't get you 1440p but the conversion is certainly possible. That would allow you to use your DVI monitor on any modern video card.

I would NOT try to switch a 1070 up to a 1080 ti just because of your monitor. Thats an upgrade, but its not a big enough upgrade to be worthwhile spending money and swapping stuff around."
Amazon seems like the safest bet unless you want the FE.
As long as theyre properly power rated you wont have an issue.
"I'm personally gonna gun for Best Buy in store pick-up/ship to store, if not then it's a crap-shoot between the two sites for ship to address."
"Yes, expecting same asterisk as with 3080. Meaning it will beat 2080ti in RTX titles with DLSS on.

Would make it amusing to watch all the panic sellers who dumped their 2080ti at <500$."
6am pacific is the NDA expiration time.
"As far as we've seen, overclocking won't be a huge deal this generation. It's like the Ryzen chips: Nvidia pushed them quite close to their limits."
They always do.
Really? Which website?
Swedish website. Komplett.se
"Not WH2, but GN did three kingdoms. All ultra  
4k - 48fps  
1440- 95"
How is it the same card? It's consistently 20% or so better on raw rasterization and the gap widens with RTX on
I'm in the same boat as you. The upgrade works out cheaper than a new console with way more performance
"I'm gonna wait for 3090 reviews and then maybe wait for the 3080ti to drop.

Think I might build a second system with my old 5820k and 1080ti though, just gotta figure out what I'll do with it first though, ha."
"Depends what games you play. 5 year old ones? Overkill.

Those coming out this year and next year? Probably good."
I have the exact same question. All anyone talks about is 4k
3080 sweetspot for 1440p 144hrz
maybe in 100 years some GPU will be able to
"1070 is about 50% faster, 3080 is about 3x times as good as 1070. 

so X = 3 times EP over 50% CP 

About 6 times faster in some scenarios."
If you own a 970... just benchmark it. Then you know.
"Its an entirely different speed class though. GDDR6X is either double or more than double the speed in every conceivable category compared to GDDR5X. Normal GDDR6 is only ~50% faster.

Theres more to VRAM than just the amount of memory available."
[deleted]
"Define ""very bad"" lol.  Sims don't need crazy frame rates. 30-50fps at 4K ultra is MORE than good enough."
"But then there is always the aspect of warranty support. Depending on what part of the world you're in, some AIB cards will have significantly more pleasant support to deal with then Nvidia."
"The reason why I will never go AMD is not because they don't have the power, it's because the drivers. Even if they come up with something better than Nvidia, if your drivers fuck up, it will not matter what you paid for."
pc gamer's review is saying 850w minimum
Fortnite runs on a graphing calculator.
I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here.
Yeah the 3070 is a dealbraker for me too. That X makes a huge difference and the 200 difference is way to narrow to turn the 3080 down.
"Any rational man would pick the 3070. But we're not those men, are we?"
"1. Best looking card

2. temps arent terrible

how could you go wrong?"
"""stop global warming by gaming on a RADEON"""
"Not really fair to compare it like you are to the 3080, wait for the 3080 TI then compare them. The 2080 TI and 3080 are in two different pricing tiers."
I think you have to wait for a possible 3080 ti to feel like a worthy upgrade if you already own a 2080 ti.
"Check out Techpowerup RT benchmark. They did Control and Metro Exodus.

The big thing here is that 3080 is some +40% over 2080 Ti in RT On scenario (without DLSS) and this might be important in the future as some RT games might not be sponsored by Nvidia to take advantage of DLSS"
"""easy"" LMAO"
70-90% performance increase over a 2080 is a letdown? Ok
Because the game is shitty lol. Not much more to it.
My rule of thumb is to subtract 20% from 1440p performance. It generally ends up being in the ballpark.
"Close, I suppose. 3440x1440 is roughly 30% larger pixel wise than 1440p but 50% less than 4K. I guess the question is really when you become CPU bound."
Jup. But could be closer to 25procent upgrade vs a 2080ti..where at 1440p its only between 7-15procent it seems. I also game on 3340x1440 so really looking forward to proper review with a 2080ti running at 2100mhz or something hehe.
"Aspect ratio doesn't affect FPS, its the total number of pixels that are required to be rendered. Ultrawide is around 5million pixels, versus 8 million on 4k. Should be closer to 1440p performance since that is 3.6 million pixels. I can also say from experience because I went from a 2560x1440 monitor to 3440x1440"
Nice. Thanks.
That's what I'm talking about!!!!!
"Ooohh this is a great find, not only does it do 3440x1440 but almost all (or all?) have comparisons with my 980 Ti.  Thanks for the post."
"Oh, finally a comparison between my 970 and 3080! Mine has been struggling a lot with UW 1440p, seems like a decent upgrade."
"> Can't do RDR2 4K ultra 60fps stable.

Just more proof it's optimised like dog shit."
FS2020 patch dropped this morning and people are seeing nice CPU efficiency upgrades. Most are starting to see GPU bottlenecks with the patch which is awesome to see.
FS2020 4k ultra @ 46 FPS is definitely playable for a slow paced sim based on graphics rather than speed.
FS got patched today and it's already a loot better. Now we just need DX12
"Is that with or without MSAA, Reflection MSAA, FXAA, Volumetrics and Reflections Quality running at maximum? Because those settings cranked up are known to tank performance (talking about -25% here), so anyone outside of a benchmarking scenario shouldn't really be running the game with those settings.

Outside of that, RDR2 on Ultra but no MSAA/FXAA 4x and Vol./Refl. Quality at Ultra should definitely be 4K60+ on a 3080."
">- FS2020 still sucks at any resolution.

This isn't due to the GPU. This game is *heavily* CPU bound"
Fuck. 3090 it is.
Damn right remember we are in a pandemic and money is tight for alot of people. People are loosing their jobs and do not have 700 laying around for a new GPU.
"The RTX and DLSS performance increase is enough for me to buy.

Also, these tech reviews don't push the OC as much as they can. I'm certain in our hands with the AIBs, well at least push another 10%-15% (above FE stock, not FE OC) out of these cards.

Edit: I meant to put 15%, not 25%. I was feeding some or my pet Salamanders at the time.

Edit 2: Okay, people want to see the Salamanders https://imgur.com/a/xbnwztQ"
I have a 2080 and hope to get a FE card tomorrow but won't cry (ok maybe a little) if I don't get it.  But would like to get 144 FPS on my 1440p.  I think the value is great. But only going for the FE.
"I'll be the one to admit after seeing these benchmarks, I'm 50% less excited.

&#x200B;

If you're playing 4k or 1440p, maybe you do a bit of editing, or if the games you play the most is Fortnite and Minecraft.  The 3080 is for you

&#x200B;

But if you're like me and you play 1080p on Low Settings.  It's hard to justify it.  The gains just aren't there.

&#x200B;

I'll admit also however, that I am on a 1070.  So, gains are gains.  So I'll attempt to get my hands on a 3080 tomorrow.  If I do, great.  If not, that's ok too"
"It's tough, I'm really on the fence. I have a 4k 144Hz monitor so an extra 30% performance is like... right on the line of being really nice to have but also perhaps not worth the hassle and slight upgrade cost. I'm super torn."
"am a 2080s owner, are these results disappointing?"
"Hey man, where did you get that half a day estimate at? This is my first time buying a GPU at launch so im worried it'll sellout instantly, does it typically sellout fast or last a few hours?"
"It's always foolish to upgrade one gen up, honestly. But most were upset that they paid $1200 for a card that's gonna be worse than a $500 GPU in a month. That hasn't changed"
"For me it is an issue of being able to sell my current 2080 for something to defer the cost. If I can get $400-$500 CAD and get an FE for around $1000 CAD then I'm only spending $500-$600 at once. Making the cost of ownership of the 2080 about $250/year or $20/month since I bought it, which I'm totally fine with."
">Im sure many 2080s and ti owners will be happily waiting for the next generation.

2080Ti here, can confirm. I was reasonably sure this wasn't going to be a huge jump from that anyway, but I'm glad to feel safe to keep my GPU another 2 years."
"> I think the launch will be not as short as some think, will propably last for half a day or so

That's a lot of wishful thinking. You need to remember the biggest contributes in killing a release day are scalpers. They're financially incentivized to purchase as many as possible."
2080ti owner were never the target anyway
"> Im sure many 2080s and ti owners will be happily waiting for the next generation.

For people playing in lower resolutions I don't know why they're looking to spend so much money on video cards anyway, especially those not pairing it with a super high refresh monitor. 1080p/60 just doesn't call for this kind of card.    
     
For us using 4k, though? It's ~50% or more boost from a 2080 to the 3080. That's absolutely enormous, and unless someone really just isn't playing anything that'd use the power (and why would they be hyping the card anyway then?) I don't see why it wouldn't be seen as a must buy. If VR is a factor, then it becomes even more desirable.    
    
For 2080ti owners it might be small enough to not want to upgrade...but it's still a decent upgrade. On the other hand, if I was willing to spend $1200 for a 2080ti last time then I'd probably be looking more at the 3090 anyway."
">Im sure many 2080s and ti owners will be happily waiting for the next generation.

And just a few days ago this subreddit was saying the 2080Ti is now a paperweight. This is why people shouldn't listen to pre-release info"
"You hit the nail on the head for me. The only game I play that my 2080s “struggles” with is FS2020 and at my res (1440p) it’s only something like 10-15% better.

I might change my tune when Cyberpunk 2077 comes out and I want to run that at ultra but I’m also hoping DLSS will help there."
this gives me hope but makes me wonder if i should upgrade at all
lol it didn't last for half a minute genius
"so, about that..."
Yeah! Everyone stay home and stay off their computer.. Don't even try and buy one. (so there is more for me)
"This is where I am minus the 1440p monitor. I have a 7700k, and have been waiting for next gen Ryzen to upgrade. But add the extra power need, the new motherboard, the extra ram I'll end up getting, and that I need more than the 650w PSU I currently have and I""m looking at a whole new build + a 1440p 144hz monitor.

I'll have to wait a while sadly."
"If you're only playing in 1440p, it will probably hold you back quite a bit even then. 1080Ti is still really strong, and the 6700k is pathetic compared to 3900X or 3950X today, specifically in multicore environments. I'm in the same boat as you, i5-4690k.

It's really noticable when playing VR because it demands so much more from the CPU, not to mention that many games are in fact CPU bound. If I were you I'd be looking at a CPU upgrade first. Perhaps look at used 2080 / 2070 supers?"
"Same thing here, only a 7700k. We wouldn’t get the full potential without a CPU upgrade as well, which changes the price/performance ratio a lot. 

I think the 1080Ti + 7700k @ 1440p is showing age, but is still very strong. I don’t feel like it’s holding me back for the things I do. Not sure it’s worth a near full rebuild just yet (thanks Intel sockets!). Perhaps a 4K or ultra wide monitor is the next logical progression before a big upgrade is justified. 

For now, I will be waiting to see what next gen CPU’s offer and will continue being content with my current setup. Maybe a 3080Ti will be available later on too."
"Same boat as you, except 7700k. Which isn't that much better. Unfortunately since we went Intel route we'd have to get a whole new motherboard in addition to a CPU. I wonder how bad bottlenecking would be for 3080 upgrade."
"The higher res will reduce the CPU bottleneck, so shouldn't be too limiting."
"I'm upgrading my CPU too.  Already ordered the X570 Mobo.  Just waiting on the 4800X announcement and put my order in.  Ya it's gonna be called the 5800X, but I'm still calling it the 4800X.  Was dead set on 4700X but 4800X gives me better OC head room since I am attending to have this CPU last quite a long time."
Same but I just got a ultrawide 1440p and planning on pushing the 6700K with overclocking until the next gen Ryzens. I'm sure we will be a little held back by the CPU but the ray tracing and other new tech over the Pascals will still make it feel like a significant upgrade. Now to see how much I can get for a 1080 ti FE...
"I want the 3080 but I'm definitely gonna hold off. Mostly I want the raytracing features but I'm still rocking a I7-4820k, 1070 ti, and a 1080p monitor (240hz IPS, Color and contrast upgrade is the bigger improvement between that and framerate vs my old 144hz TN). Much of the performance improvement would be lost on me (or unavailable cause throttling) unless I upgraded cpu and/or monitor."
"damn bro, I have a 1080 and had it paired with a 6700K. I was playing Warzone at medium setting and getting ~60FPS. I upgraded to a 10900K with my existing 1080 and now I get 100-120FPS on the same settings. I am really hoping the 3080 is a very noticeable bump because I have friends with 2080's and the jump from 1080->2080 was not that impressive to me."
"I have a 1080 ti, for me i am completely content eith my 80ish fps gaming at 4k currently. If they want me to jump then they need to offer me 80 fps with RT on. 3080 does not seem to offer that so im going to see the benchmarks for the 3090 and future Ti"
"If Jensen's presentation wasn't so cherry picked and gave people realistic expectations, no one would have been disappointed."
I have a stock 1080 also and I can't wait for the 3080
1080 club wooo
What CPU do you have? I have a 2600x and I'm wondering if I should pull the trigger for 1440p 144hz gaming
"Running a 780 myself. Have the parts for an entire new computer minus a GPU sitting on my floor. Really hope I can snag a 3080 tomorrow so I can join the future and stop playing on min settings, haha."
"Expect another 15% on top of the 3080, so roughly +45% performance from the base 2080Ti but with way more VRAM headroom. Personally I'm gunna hold out and try to snag a 3090, and if that isn't possible then I'll get the inevitable 3080Ti (with 20GB) they almost assuredly have waiting in the wings."
Ultrawide bro. It is life.
"Yep! 1070ti with a 1440p display here, this is going to be a fantastic upgrade!"
"Fellow 1070 user already on 1440p. She struggles on that resolution a bit, but a new 3080 should pair with it nicely!"
"I'm in the same boat. I knew I was going to need to upgrade from 1080p in order to make this card worth it. What I'm struggling with now is whether I should go with an IPS or TN monitor. What monitors are you interested in? I'll be upgrading from a 1080p 240hz TN. 

Part of me thinks I should stay with a TN because I tend to play more competitive games, but then I remember that I'm 31 and not looking to be a professional gamer anytime soon."
"4k will replace 1440p in probably 5 years id imagine. people are constantly still realizing higher refresh rate is more enjoyable than resolution.

itll take time for 4k/120hz+ and hardware to be able to comfortably play 4k/120fps. the main push will be 4k/165hz.

then itll take more time for people to justify replacing their $3-600+ monitor they just bought a few years ago. 

it just takes a lot to move next tier resolutions. hell, we're still clinging onto 1080p."
"I had a 1070 as well when I started to game on 1440p. Now I'm on the 5700 XT, but the next upgrade will definitely be 3080. Unless AMD comes with a ''better'' option."
And make it 144hz.
"Yeah, my big take away from all the reviews is the panel will be the choke point for my system and that should take priority over CPU/MB upgrades."
Go ultra wide! So worth it and the performance drop is minimal compared to 4k!
"Or a friend.

Hello, it is I, friend."
"I think the reason for such a small delta in performance increase is due to power limitations. the 3080 already hits the cap of 375W in GN's review with a small OC, and even then- it wasn't enough power. I have a feeling 3x8pin 3090s will have a much larger improvement."
My concern is maximizing resale value of our 2080s. I think stock on the 3080's is going to be super limited and leave the resale market in good shape for awhile yet before they're widely available. I've had my strix 2080 for two years and if I can get half the cost back I'm more than happy with that.
No reason to upgrade to the 3080 over a 2080 Ti. Will wait to see what the 3090 gives us.
Stay at 144hz 1440p unless you want to jump 240hz
"I'm still rocking my 970, and working from home as a 3D artist is workable but could be a lot better. Hope I can get my hands on a 3080 tomorrow."
You guys have gpus?
3090 will show what we can expect from the 3080Ti.
"Went from talk of 40-60% better than 2080ti to 25-30%.

That's enough to make me sit out for 6 months to see if a refresh gets announced or AIB can get more out of the 3080"
"> in any game with everything maxed. 

...what? Graphics are getting better every year, and we're gonna see a big boost in that now that Next Gen consoles are coming out. It's basically always impossible to get top-tier performance with EVERYTHING maxed. Everything includes ray tracing"
"If you bout it 1-2 years ago, you were fine."
"I bought one this year because it was unparalleled for performance at the time. I'm still keeping my card until 3080ti or better. I don't feel like an idiot at all, for 2k uhd gaming it will serve me well, at 1080p uhd none of my boys can match my fps. I got my card for $1199 in may and also watercooled it in august. Altogether its been a pleasant experience so I don't know why people keep insisting that i goofed."
"If you sold your 2080ti for $600, you're still smiling. The 3080 is a serious upgrade for $200. New card, new warranty, 25% raster performance increase, huge RTX performance increase..

The 2080ti will be a $450 card when the dust settles from the 3070 launch."
">	your going to buy one

You’re*"
He just released his [Asus RTX 3080 TUF OC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOUHnwUC00I) review. Please add the link.
Well I'll let you know when I get the card cuz my only desktop fits in my backpack lmao.
"Jay went as far as to say having more air flowing to the cpu / ram could be a good thing.  He also said the air was ""warmish""."
"Thanks for the information.  I have exactly the same case, but my CPU is air cooled (it seems yours is not)."
"I have some spare 120mm fans from an old build, so I’m planning to add an additional intake fan in the front.  I don’t think they would fit in top rear since they are quite thick.

I maybe eventually get an AIB in any case, since I’m not sure about the availability of FE cards."
[deleted]
My 980 TI FTW SLI rig can push Witcher 3 at 3440x1440 at about 55 FPS with every option maxed out.  But like you I want to max CyberPunk on day one.
Hope it is worth the hype 🙏🙏🙏
For you it's available at 7AM PST. For everyone else it's 6AM PST ;)
"Same here. I was a bit apprehensive at first since I only bought my 1060 two years ago, but having recently upgraded both monitor and CPU the bottleneck was starting to become too noticeable."
Same. Literally going to see 10x more performance than my current system
"That's an awesome upgrade, congrats! I should replace my cpu too to lock those 144fps at 1440p haha I'm locked to amd now though, so fingers crossed for zen3 gaming performance."
Honestly just getting that 10900k will net you a lot of performance
Hell yeah brother. May it win many more matches
Waiting for the shorter PCB 3070 or a 3060.
"Oh god yes. Im sitting here waiting for the 3090, currently using a 980ti to play my index. I want that sweet power already.."
"The benches, probably:

> u good

Until the Reverb Gen 2 comes out we've pretty much reach the cap in terms of performance demand. The O+ and the Index have the highest res panels which are easily powered at 90 hz by a 2080 ti or 2080S. The 120 hz is a little more demanding of a 2080 ti on the Index but we can assume pretty handily that everything available rn will run maxed out with 1.5 SS on the 3080"
Yeah I saw that as well. I was hoping someone had a comparison with the 2080/2080 TI
"Omg, ED in vr on high @ 120fps! Someone come check on me after I binge this game again for the next 3 months."
"Wonder how much better the 3090 will do with VR. I'm also struggling on what to purchase because there isn't a clear answer on if there will be a 3080 Ti that comes out later. I'm still running a 1080 Ti, but don't want to upgrade if a new Ti is coming out in the next six months."
Now I want one.. damn you.
I'm just as excited for Dirt Rally 2.0 VR gains.
"Same here, got a Gigabyte Windforce that's constantly running 80-85C with fans at 100%.

The FE this time around is looking really compelling, but I'm not sure if I want to go that route or gamble with EVGA at launch and get the XC3 Ultra, or another AIB. So many decisions to make today."
"Yeah I upgraded from a 980ti to a 5700XT last year, as I just couldn't wait anymore, wanting to upgrade to 1440p144 but the 20 series Nvidia cards were way too expensive for my liking.

Decent card that 5700XT, but it can run very hot and quite loud, comparing some benchmarks today and it seems upgrading from my 5700XT to the 3080 will gain me almost 2x the performance while it's still running quieter and slightly cooler even than I'm currently used to, lol.

Obviously the 5700XT was never meant to be a high-high-end card, but I'm happy I bought it to hold me over until now. Looking to me like it's as big a jump from the 5700XT to the 3080 as my jump from the 980ti was to the 5700XT lol, and that took me 4 years."
"I'm starting to wonder if I won some sort of lottery, my 1080 will barely hit 70 under load."
"After seeing reviews I will say I don't think this generation would be as compelling if I was coming from something in the 20 series, but I do think it still holds up and looks like a promising upgrade for people on 10 series, 16 series, or older.

3070 being equivalent to a 2080 Ti though? I'm not so sure, we'll just have to wait and see. I think that may be true with founder's edition cards at stock clocks as the comparison point. But as Gamer's Nexus pointed out you can get reasonably close to 3080 performance with a 2080 Ti Strix OC'd, so it's definitely not going to hold true in every case."
"Well under load SLI 480s definitely were pulling more than a 3080 ever will. I can't give you an exact idea of how much hotter the room itself will get, that depends heavily on the size of the room and how good your A/C is, but I spent a lot of my gaming time shirtless with a fan within like 5 feet of me in a fairly average 13x10 bedroom.

I expect to relive those glory days soon enough."
Both Tim and Steve work for Techspot. The YouTube channel is just a video version of the content they make for the site.
"If you can wait, I'd see what Zen 3 will look like on October 8. But a 3700x should be fine."
Did you read the article?
"Yeah.  
  
It’s always interesting how the crossfire goes between AMD and NVidia.   
  
It seems the general trend is that NVidia will announce/release first, AMD will counter with no competition at the high end, but undercutting prices at the mid/low end. Then NVidia drops the xx60 and xx50 cards you slot mostly along side of the AMD cards.  
  
A few months later, the xx80 ti comes out and sets the flagship until the next generation.  
  
We’ll see, but I’m still doing pretty good on my 1080 ti, and I can wait for a few months before pulling the trigger."
Same. I'm waiting for 3080ti or even a 3070tisuperwhatever to decide.
I’d assume the 26th before the 3090 release
"Yep, waiting on 3080 ti or 20gb variant, as well as top model big Navi before any purchase it made."
You must have extremly good noise-blocking headphones if you want a FE.
"Bad cooling, too loud."
You are delusional. And the 150$ is for the 3090.
"For its size it probably will be the best cooler, but the FE is a 2 slot card and it's going to be very difficult to compete with a 2.7 slot AIB card that simply has a bigger heatsink and 3 fans."
"But it also has power limitation issues, meaning 0% chance of overclocking"
"Nah, the FE cooler will probably wreak havoc on the airflow of small cases, especially sandwich models."
That $150 is just a stupid rumour. A heat sink and 2 $3 fans wont cost $150.
Same. I'll be scrambling for one tomorrow
"Same re the HDMI 2.1/variable refresh compatibility, albeit going for a 3090 as I'd like to get as close to being able to do 4k/120hz as possible (although I suspect the 3090 will still be a way off, but does have the option of adding a second card via NV Link at a later date at least)."
"I have a C9 on my living room, but on my bedroom I only have a B9, do you know if the B9 can also handle it?"
"Yeah, those of us who skipped Turing are living large right now. I'd also say it's a relatively safe bet that any 2080 Ti owners that wait for the 4080 will be living large as well."
Have you seen the benchmarks? Games like rainbow six siege gets 90 more FPS on 1440p
"Price to performance doesn't make sense in that I (personally) think it's too much of a hassle to sell your 2080Ti and pick up a 3080 even though it gives ""only"" 30% extra performance, while still having almost all the technological features that the 2000 series has already, where you can just overclock the 2080Ti to reach somewhat close to 3080 performance and then save the cash for the 4000 series."
"hey hey people, Philip here"
happy cake day
"> they heard some coil whine

this happens with literally any design. It's just bad luck."
Can't undervolt Ampere
"I don't think they chose to ""push"" the fan but rather they chose to keep it out of box so we can all reference how it will perform if any one of us used the card out of box."
jensen bless.
"Thank you! That's very decent. Was kinda bummed at regular 1440p performance, cause that gave me heavy remorse about my 2080ti sale. This I can live with."
Yeah this looks really good to.
This would make integration into VR games of DLSS 2.0 HUGE going forward.
"Thanks for sharing. Not bad, but with updated afterburner it can be done even better i think :)"
Thanks! I started from the ComputerBase finding and also just got this. I will look into this.
Looks like your stradegy worked! thank you!
"Thanks! I figured I should just wait. I just wanted to get my hands on something new cause my stuff is so old. But patience will save me 200 bucks lol, I still dont know what brand to get tho, ASUS or MSI."
"Yeah I have the Full HD MSI MAG240 144 hz. I figured I might be better off with the 3070, was just hyped to get something new tbh. My stuff is so outdated lol"
"I have a 6700K and will upgrade to a 5900X next year probably. Looking at BitWit's video, it's 537W with a 3950X and 460W with essentially a 3600."
Yep.. Should be ok with my 8600k. Will upgrade that eventually but not too worried for now until I see where I am topping out.
I see. Makes me feel better about getting a 850W.
Went from EVGA G3 650W to Super Flower Leadex III 850W.
I watched BitWit's video. He got 537W with a 3950X and 460W with essentially a 3600. A 650W is more than enough.
For $500 less.
The FE averaged 25% better fps at 1440p vs the strix 2080ti
"youre getting all the software features, there are none that are only available on 30xx afaik"
Cyberpunk isn't even getting the next gen upgrade until later next year anyway.
"If you are going to wait a year already might wait another year for the new arch ? Cause in 1 year it only refreshes the cards and most likely it will be 10% increase in performance for the same price.
Now a new arch and node could mean anything from 25 to 60% for the same price."
"From what I remember, stuff like Reflex was only on the 30 series, but I could be wrong."
Yep any RTX card
"I'll def be waiting to see what AMD puts out and then how that stacks against Nvidia. Mostly curious to see how things in Cyberpunk turn out and I'll make a decision then.

Really in no rush to upgrade at this time."
"The money really isn't an issue here. Performance wise, I just don't see a need as of now.

I'll be waiting to see what AMD has to offer and benchmarks in Cyberpunk. That'll be the deciding factor for me for sure."
What extra features? I guess there is nothing that the 3000s can do the 2000s can't do. Not a worth it upgrade(specially if you have 2080ti) at all unless you're rich and you don't care about it.
"Have to look at this way -  selling a item for 60+% depreciation and paying another 40%+ over your sell price for 30% better performance at 4k is a terrible idea.Also lets be frank, majority of 2080ti users are at 1440p...most are not rocking 4k high res gaming panels. 

so in end, if you miss your chance to sell 2080ti before crash...no point to spend extra to continue playing 1440p when 2080ti performance was already good at 1440p anyway."
"I wouldn't bother, but with a 2070S, I'm probably going to get a 3080. Should be a large increase."
"Willing to wager that vast majority of 2080ti owners are not rocking 4k high refresh panels. So after missing the the chance to sell before 2080ti price cash, makes no sense to pay more from now sale price to continue playing at 1440p resolution.

Until we get cheaper 4k high end monitors, makes no sense for 2080ti folks to sell now.Might as well continue gaming at 1440p till new better monitors more readily available. 

Anyway, I am hoping to score a 2080ti for 400 orless if can lol."
How much performance difference do you think will happen with said cards?
So just to clarify - do you believe they will have superior performance without overclocking?
? What I read was the FE had quite a bit more power than reference chips. And most the good AIB seem to cost an extra $200+
"I know not everyone is willing to do this but I just wanted to point out that you will probably be able flash your vBIOS to unlock higher power limits on the FE. The new 12-pin connector is capable of delivering up to 600W (someone please fact check me on this), so with a different vBIOS in theory you would be able to push the FE pretty hard. The FE is $100 cheaper and has already been proven to have a very capable cooler, so just  keep that in mind before you are spending your money on a very pricey AIB model (for example where I live in Canada the MSI Gaming Trio is going for $1200 CAD which equates to about $910 USD, which is a hefty price increase over the $700 FE), you may be able to get similar performance/thermals with the FE assuming you can find an appropriate vBIOS."
"Shame. In my country FE cards are pretty much unobtainable, it's all 3rd party AIBs.

I just love the reference design so much this gen."
"I want a blower card, though (but that'd be an insane setup given the over 300W it's drawing). Or at least a basic flat two-slot tri-fan that isn't ""GAMERRRRRRRRRR"" shit. Founders is a great compromise, but will be gone in 60 seconds.

Guess I'll have to print one myself."
So you don't believe they will have a performance edge outside overclocking? I am asking because i am leaning towards FE (i never oc anyway) but i don't wanna miss out on non-oc performance.
What do you think about noise? 42dB while gaming seems good. Do you think there will be some 35dB AIBs?
"Add in board. It’s refers to 3rd party cards (EVGA, MSI, ASUS, etc)"
"Add In Board.

(Third party cards like ASUS, MSI, EVGA etc)"
Msi asus evga cards.
Tomorrow I believe they’ll be out
I don't plan on overclocking. Ty for the help!
"Awesome sounds good, I'll be looking for the FE tomorrow then so hopefully I'll get one before it sells out. Thanks a bunch"
Interesting point. How do you think AIB noise levels will compare to FE?
Happy cake day sir
but will the 3070 be able to last at least 4-6 years with those 144hz 1440p games?
"Digital Foundry's video would probably show you what you need then. They compared it to the 1080 in alot of their benchmarks and showed a 2.5x increase or more in alot of games. [Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7FlXu9dAMU).

However for the 1080P part, it seems the majority of reviews are focused on 4K and 1440P, as there are big CPU bottlenecks at lower resolutions preventing the card from stretching its legs.

But yeah it will still hit those fps targets obviously, in fact i'd say it would be an actual ""future-proof"" card for 1080P for a long time, if you're interested in that."
"It never even said anything for nvidia on mine. Best Buy went from coming soon to sold out immediately, never had an opportunity"
Better be able to pre-order after this
Out of stock instantly :(
It says out of stock
You're absolutely right. 2070 super is coming out of my machine and in goes the 3080
"youre seeing a lot of people downplaying the numbers here because they're not a 200% increase.

a 50% increase is a huge leap. what's normal for current gen to next gen? 15-30%? 

some numbers from last gen.

in gta v at 4k

rtx 2080: 61 fps

gtx 1080 45 fps

this is a 36% increase.

rtx 3080 96 fps

rtx 2080 61 fps

this is a 57% increase

"It's about 50% over the 2080 (Hardware Unboxed 14-game average was 47% if I remember right), so it'd be an even bigger upgrade over the 2070.     
     
The only way that's not a big enough upgrade is if I were shopping for hype and not performance gains. I think expecting more than that was a little crazy, no matter what Nvidia said."
"Igor's lab shows my 5700 XT at 65% in 1440p.. which is slightly worse than a 2070 Super.

So it's really not that much of a jump as Nvidia advertised."
Exactly my opinions. I'll wait for the next cards/super or TI editions and then re-evaluate.
Biggest issue is that it seem be bottlenecked by architecture at 1440p too. So seems a bit like a waste.
I have a 3440 x 1440 monitor and a 2070S and I'm considering it. It's just on the border. But I think we'll be fine if we keep our cards another generation. Or wait for ti.
"You have spoken to me. I will be upgrading from my 1060.

But im hearing rumors that a 3080 ti will come out the end of this yeear"
"Prices here in Singapore are a little bit higher as compared to the US and the founders edition costs 810USD. I have a 1440p 144hz with gsync and the 2070 super is doing just fine for now. What really intrigued me about the 3080 was the claim that it was 2x as fast as a 2080, but that was rarely the case in 1440p. HUGE improvements were only seen in 4K and I don't plan to change my LG 27GL850 anytime soon. But hey, to each their own, some may want their games to be running at 144hz constantly but as I have gsync, this isn't really an issue for me."
Impressive. But not justifiable enough for me. Others may feel differently but this is just my opinion.
"Also on a 980TI, are you going for the FE 3080?"
GTX 770 here reporting in :)
[deleted]
"Your 2080ti is 20% faster than stock?

Even if you mean a stock card that’s not oc’d I doubt that’s the case.

Then if you compare a properly oc’d stock vs whatever you have I doubt the difference is much."
"2070 super is still a decent card, so it just depends- are you trying to run ultrawide 3440x1440 at 144hz, or 4k at 60+?  Then yes, probably worth upgrading.  Are you running 1440 standard screen, or 1080p? I'd wait a bit, or maybe upgrade the monitor first."
2070 Super is basically a 1080Ti in terms of performance so still a good upgrade
60-90% better at 4K in most title according to Jayz 2 cents  and Gamers Nexus
"If you don't know (other than there being no benchmarks yet), then you don't ~~want~~ need a 3090.

Also there will be a 3080 Ti/Super/whatever."
Im coming from a 980ti and I use it for VR and Im having a hard time justifying a 3090.
"Not op but tyvm for this video, I play Apex at UW1440p on a 2070S and get about 70-90fps in game..will be great to hover around the 144 mark!"
"Same, but I am upgrading from a 980"
There are a few tests that specifically show that it does not raise any cpu temps due to this exact reason.
"i wish there was a place where I could compare how much more it will take vs my 1060, and how much it will cost per month"
"3090 is expected to be another 15-25% performance on 3080 *but* at over 100% price increase. It seems like a way better idea to grab a 3080 and upgrade again in a shorter period (or use the money elsewhere in PC or life).

I went into the announcement expecting to pre order a £1400 GPU and came out wanting to buy the £650-750 instead."
"Only that the consoles are based on rdna 2,and from what we know about the consoles, they are at the 2080 level,from what digital foundry said.

Let's see, I don't think amd drivers are gonna be stable, since their drivers are usually never stable"
"Rdna1 only launched with tiny gpu's. And they already stated a 50% perf/watt. We don't really know what that means yet, but if it's rx 5700xt +50%, that's a damn efficient card. AMD would be matching the 2080 ti at significantly less power consumption. But AMD's likely to up the CU count this generation, so I wouldn't be surprised if they've got something that beats the 2080 ti while still drawing less power."
Bitwit’s video showed it consuming 460W. Think I’m fine.
"people didn't actually look at the GRAPH, only the 1x9. Then they say nvidia ""lied"""
"Yep. 2kiliksphilip did actually [replicate the Nvidia claim using a 60 fps cap in Control](https://youtu.be/SwX_eKUOyFg?t=563). But overall power usage has definitely gone up, and by a fairly similar amount to the overall increase in performance.  

Of course, it will be interesting to see what Nvidia can do with 5nm (and Hopper) on the efficiency front."
"I haven’t taken transistor physics in 20 years, so I could be way off, but is this power increase because they have to up the voltage to make the transistors stable at a given frequency?  Or is there another reason for the power increase?"
"Yeah, but if you look at the performance per watt at stock, where nearly everyone will be running it, the improvement is less than 10%. So that's kind of irrelevant. If the only way to see the perf/watt gain is by removing the performance you gained by buying the new card, I don't really see the point. Pascal was impressive because it had a massive increase in perf/watt at stock. The 1080 drew 60-70w less than the 980ti while outperforming it by 25-30% on average. So when Nvidia called this a Pascal moment during their presentation, they were wayyy overselling it. This is a fermi-like launch, but the lack of competition, and the nifty card design makes it less obvious."
"Samsung 8N sucks power like crazy after a certain frequency.

TSMC 7nm or even 5nm will provide huge gains."
"> I am personally curious like why it seems more difficult like to gain more perf/watt improvement in GPU technically than in CPU

It's an issue across the board, even with CPU. Look up Dennard Scaling. The issue is that we've been at a point for a while where shrinking processes causes the designers to have to deal with more and more current leakage, which ramps up heat."
It's worth mentioning that there is a large enough population of those of us in PC gaming with cheap power that we don't really even consider power consumption relevant.
I  just wanna know why ppl care about power usage so much lol. These are not laptops
Why does this matter? Outside of needing to upgrade your PSU why care about performance per watt?
320 watts / 260 watts = 1.23...
[deleted]
"The efficiency is pitiful, plain and simple."
People who want to know if they need a bigger PSU. It's very important.
What leaks? Haven’t seen any.
"I'm going to go on a limb and say the FE, despite its better than expected cooling solution, will still be behind AIBs when it comes to cooling and noise level.  A tried and true rule when it comes to air cooling is more fans = less heat and less heat = less noise.  I think there's a reason we aren't seeing a single AIB with only 2 fans."
What do you mean limited power delivery? What does that mean for me? Someone who doesn't overclock anything and just plugs and plays.
"How is it a small increase, it obviously depends on the game but for example with Warzone at 1440 it’s a 40% gain over a 2080ti.

Why would you compare a ocd 2080ti with a stock card? Wait till we get better overclocked results and cards once people actually have a chance to tune them.

Not to mention all this testing is without driver and game optimizations. 

This is a solid step up from a 2080ti assuming same $ and the reduction in price makes it an incredible step up."
"No shit, that’s technology lmao. Also, most people with a 2080 ti will probably wait for a 3080 super or the 3090.. trust me they don’t have $ issues"
Yes I saw on the OP. That’s why I mentioned it. I just don’t see a point of them doing it next week when everyone will already have the cards.
"Comparing bench marks from gamers nexus and Jay with people like Linus and bitwit/ Paul's hardware.

At 4kbsire they roughly the same but that's expected its the 1440p and especially 1080p bench's that show the ryzen chips leaving performance on the floor.

I never trust anything hardware unboxed says he means way toonhard towards amd fanboy for me to take serious.

He puts getting amd fans clicks and interaction above being unbiased."
How does that work exactly? Only a 7-15 increase at 2k but higher at 4K ??
"Right, that's a 3080 vs an \*OCed\* 2080 Ti, and you're still seeing 20%+ performance increase in 4k. You're not comparing like with like if you put a stock card against an OCed one."
"They don’t even look at the breakdown of games, they just quote the average, when a third of the games are so poorly optimised there is barely any gap between 2080s-2080ti-3080 (far cry). Of course the average is pulled down by these, remove them and the 3080 is a very strong 30% faster"
Dumbest people on the internet but I blame the echo chamber voting system. If you had like a top contrarian and a top pro thread it would really help with the circlejerking/anti-jerking.
This needs to be pinned on the homepage.
"That's not what we're seeing, though. Benchmarks have 3080 out-performing 2080 Ti by 20%ish in 1440, and 30%ish in 4k. At not much more than half the price of a 2080 Ti, that is an amazing jump in performance, and tracks with the 3070 being roughly equal in 2080 Ti in performance at a third of the price."
"Lmao, did we watch the same reviews? On average, the 3080 outperforms the 2080ti by a solid 30% at a little more than half the price. The 2080 (not super) gets outperformed by around 70% (at least in games that don't have garbage optimization...) at the same price. Yes, it's a little behind the 100% claims (although they can be reached, so technically they didn't lie to us), but it's damn impressive nonetheless"
"Thanks for the suggestion but FYI for those looking, Techgage didn't cover it. Part of the issue is that most of the times you would be running these things on Linux and basically everybody is just benchmarking in Windows.

I see that previously Phoronix has published TensorFlow ResNet training benchmarks (e.g. [https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=rocm19-nvidia415-compute&num=4](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=rocm19-nvidia415-compute&num=4)). I guess that's fair enough. I'd like to see more architectures, PyTorch as well, etc. but it should be representative. Bad news is that it doesn't seem like Phoronix has the RTX 3080 yet.

May also want to check lambdalabs but they don't have anything yet either for performance: [https://lambdalabs.com/blog/deep-learning-hardware-deep-dive-rtx-30xx/](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/deep-learning-hardware-deep-dive-rtx-30xx/)

These cards are likely pretty good for deep learning but I don't think Nvidia wants to cannibalize their sales of higher margin products with highlighting this use case on RTX 3080. I wonder about 3090 though, as that has 24 GB VRAM and is more a Titan replacement (and is much more expensive)."
"Awesome, much appreciated."
Thanks for this!
Thanks!
Hopefully before sales. Really wanted to see it before getting Out of Stock.
My friends said it was not worth it to just get a 2080s. Oh well.
"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/itirn5/rtx_3080_review_day_launch_day_protocol/) post, I don't know if it's an official thing or not, that's why I'm asking"
Sure hope so.
I don't think that's true. 1 of my friends who stayed up said they successfully ordered ones from best buy
"Komplett.no, norwegian. 3080 TUF OC"
"You'd be reaaaally surprised...seen way too many comments saying ""2x 2080"" and I've even seen some saying ""2x the performance of a 2080ti!"""
"Reviews, testing, etc. Plan on keeping the 3090 and passing the 3080 on."
6 Pacific. 9 Eastern.
I thought it was 9am eastern tomorrow?
"yeah I know that it consumes a lot more power, I guess I just got used to the 1080ti never even getting close to 70° even if it's overclocked"
"Thanks gonna do that

Edit: great review, thanks again :)"
"There's a popular mod that fixes that and lets you play unlocked, but I still only get ~80ish on my 1070."
"So I see Asobo dropped an update today and I've seen a +10-15 increase in FPS and my dev tools show that both my GPU and CPU are bottlenecking somewhat evenly now vs fully CPU, so I feel a bit better now with the idea of the purchase. Will work on a CPU overclock once I get the 3080 XD"
I think 144hz is more important than 4k. Right now I've got a 4k but it only does 60hz. I was contemplating a 4k 144hz though. I know they are quite pricey and will certainly go down in price eventually but... everything will if you wait long enough I suppose.
"As someone who switches between 1440p 165hz monitor and a 4k@120hz tv I would do everything you can to avoid having to swap which monitor you game on. 

Windows and games are terrible for it, so many issues or hoops to jump through that'll make you not want to play some games. Sometimes it's having to window and move across, sometimes it's using DSR on your primary just to fake the resolution for your other monitor, sometimes it just forever acts like it's on a specific monitor unless you turn it off in display settings / Win+P"
"Is it undervolted or just reduced power limit? If undervolted then a bit disappointing, if power limit reduced, then promising..."
"no we already have. doom external and  unreal 5 is using it atm(in star waws show).

flight sim 2020"
"I meant for 3rd party vendor cards like MSI and ASUS that uses 3 PCIe connectors. Sorry I didn't mention that in my comment. Is it okay to use 2 PCIe cables, 1 having only one 6+2 connector and the other cable having 2x 6+2 connector instead of 3 separate PCIe cables? I have another question.. Can i order an RTX 3080 FE from The Netherlands if i live in Belgium? The Belgian site automatically defaults to french and i don't speak that language. Thanks.."
"I would say congrats and enjoy the upgrade in advance! :) it is a  good time to upgrade for sure.

Indeed, if I were you I would wait a bit to check about the AIB, especially if you have fun doing the OC itself (it costs time but it is satisfying to me). I am with 2080S now and will wait and see AMD offering and decide later."
"same . power draw is to much atm. i got 3080s for 3 machine dirt cheap. not new.

but i also got battery back ups. 

so  if i put this cards into machine i have that on ups..

i have to buy 2k worth of them(around 3 of them) due to how much power draw with cpu etc in machines."
"Like Death Stranding that gets more FPS with more CPU cores. Is there a comparison between Ryzen and Intel in Death Stranding? Only saw how it scales on one Intel CPU with deactivated cores up to the full 24 cores. I think it was from CapframeX. I will search for a comparison.

Edit: Found one, the Ryzen 9 3900XT (12C/24T) is faster as the Intel i9-9900k (8C/16T)."
"Thirded. It was only a placeholder, poor baby."
"Ok mate cool, thank you!"
"Damn that sucks. I don't really have a backup plan since I'm hoping to get a 3080 FE, and I'm not excited about the higher AIB prices. 

I would typically buy EVGA but I don't care for the FTW3 design this time around. Asus is too expensive, and MSI is shady, so I guess that leaves Zotac and Gigabyte for US?"
Thanks bro
"Thanks for the response. Yes, lets hope the bots don't find a loophole."
"What resolution are you currently using and at what framerate? Could your current monitor achieve a higher resolution or framerate with a more powerful GPU?

The point I'm putting out there is: With the potential for greater performance, how many existing setups will need to change to accommodate greater value a new 3080 potentially offers??"
"Ok perfect. Wasnt sure if it was treated as a 'limited edition' type product. Sounds like they will keep going until people have had their fill.

Thank you!"
Thank you for the info!
Thanks for the update and that is depressing. I was so excited to read that. Don't know why I ever believed it would be true considering they never enabled it before. That would of been so epic.
"it varies from game to game, but most people consider 10% to be the point in which a GPU is bottlenecked, and in some of the titles in that website, it reached around 20% bottleneck. my 6700k only OC to 4.4ghz so i suppose my worst case scenario is being bottlenecked by maybe around 18%"
"But still, the current normal drivers might not be designed with these new cards in mind so maybe there's room for improvement in that aspect."
"Thank you I had my eye on that one actually!

  


Will it be compatible with my current MOBO? I looked at the support page and I only see the non-K versions listed in there. I know the list isn't life or death but will it be compatible? I'm running a TUF Gaming B365M plus gaming board rn.

So if I can't get the K version, will a standard 9900 even be an ""upgrade"" from an i5 9400f? I know it's better but I mean for gaming purposes."
"It was more so about the possibility of being able to use the power supply safely, but I just realized that the OCZ PSU only includes one 6+2 cable and using the 6+2 cable from the Corsair one is not a good idea at all. I'm definitely going to upgrade to something more recent and fully modular. Now I just have to wait for a good deal on one. Any suggestions on specific models?"
"I got 566w, so a 84w headroom"
"Very true, however my concern is... will I notice enough of a boost to warrant upgrading tomorrow versus waiting until I upgrade the cpu or monitor or both, or am I going to be just so bottlenecked by the CPU that it isn't worth it."
Ah ok ty love you
Ok ty love you
Lol you don’t actually have to buy the stuff after you make an account. You can just back out.
"You don't need to buy something, as long as it's in your cart you're set. It'll let you register a shop account, and edit in your billing, shipping, and payment information for future purchases.

It doesn't even have captcha though, which worries me."
"Appreciate the answer, I’m switching over from AMD so haven’t been familiar with Nvidia 3rd party coolers. I have heard good things about EVGA for the most part I think, thanks for the info!"
"Sorry, I should have clarified my previous monitor was a 3440x1440 ultrawide which would be 4,953,600 and about 16% more pixels than the Samsung. I guess I could ballpark it by expecting 16% less fps from all the 1440p benchmarks, but that's probably not the best way to do it."
Thanks! I heard rumors the higher end STRIX etc won't be included... hoping thats false

ty.  Going to wait for Big Navi to make a decision.
3090 is still next week fam
"Vram is speed and quantity of data. You get a huge performance hit when you go over the quantity. Speed does not change that fact. Just like normal  ram, it has to fall back to much much slower memory if you go over the amount you get and gddr6x won't change that"
Because they went with DX11 for some strange reason.
Is Nvidia’s support known you be bad? Which AIB has the best customer service?
But on numerous revievs max power draw of the whole pc is around 520 and with very power hungry cpus. I even read one with total system draw 478 with 9900k. 850w is even more overkill than nvidias recommended 750w.
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking rn. When the 2000 series Released. Everyone was too busy getting the aib cards. The FE cards sat for a while. Might have to get another FE
"You're probably right about that. I might have jumped the gun a few years too early on ultrawide. I figured I might get reasonable fps on 3440x1440 with a 3080, [but many of the games aren't even hitting 100fps average in 1440p.](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-amd-3900-xt-vs-intel-10900k/)"
"Almost no game is CPU bound at 1440p, or it's minimal enough that it doesn't matter because you are in hundreds of FPS range at that point."
"> I guess the question is really when you become CPU cound.

Never, because you just increase AA or push up the resolution manually for supersampling. This massively increases image quality and will bring any even slightly demanding game to a GPU limit."
~40% less than 4K actually
"What they mean is that the wider aspect ratio is also giving a wider field of view. So it isn't just rendering the same scene at a higher resolution, it's also rendering a bigger scene."
A lot of the ultra settings in rdr2 tank fps for little visual improvement
Game is just demanding.
[deleted]
"That by itself is not proof of poor optimization, is it? It seems to me that it might simply be more demanding because it's doing more. That's certainly a possibility. 

Anyway, I'm willing to believe that optimization is the issue, but that's not the default answer for one game being more demanding than another."
"bruh the last big update removed fucking eyes from certain characters and introduced lighting bugs as well as countless other bugs, the game is degrading in quality."
"The 3080 is only 10% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti when it comes to RDR2, add to that it's pulling a whopping 350w (Asus TUF 3080).

In Flight simulator at 1440p the 3080 is only 7% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti. To me that is just crazy, of course in other games it demolishes the 2080ti but man was I expecting better when it comes those 2 titles."
Keep in mind that people who are relatively well paid aren’t as effected by the downturn as those on the bottom.
I’m really surprised at how much people are spending on tech. It seems a lot of money that would go elsewhere is going into the hands of all the big tech giants. No one is going on vacation or eating in restaurants. I’d guess that’s the majority of fun money people spend under normal circumstances.
"You would be surprised, it seems like there's 2 realities out there... People than can't pay rent and people with a lot of free time at home and nowhere to go, so they're spending money on backyard renovations, TVs and electronics"
I'm a contractor and my job is ending at the end of December...but I am so tempted to order a 3080 as soon as I find one available.
plus we have ps5 coming out soon.
"Many people don't, but way more people are working than have lost jobs this year."
"I’m taking out a second mortgage on my house, jking but maybe they didn’t make as many cards because people have less money?"
For everyone who lost their job there are more people who didn't lose their jobs and are stuck at home with no way to spend money. :P
But also people who can are way more incentivized bc they probably feel they will get the most use out of it right now
"That's true, you may be right. On the other hand. Pretty sure most people just buy stuff like this on a credit card.  That makes me sick to think about, we got out of debt a few years ago and plan to stay that way, but I get it since most people just can't get far enough ahead to not buy expansive stuff on credit.   On the gripping hand, the white collar and tech economy is much stronger than other areas so a lot of people who would consider a $700 graphics card may still be getting a paycheck same as before covid.  

We will find out today!   My money is on a complete sellout worldwide by the end of the day.  Maybe before 7am PST.  But I hope to be wrong.  And I hope the 3090 has enough that I can snag one."
I know a lot of people that collected a lot of money on unemployment under the CARES Act.   This will sell quick.
You're out of your mind if you think OC'ing one of these cards is going to get you a 25% performance increase.
I saw the GN review and Steve mentioned that the FE is power limited so he can't push the overclock further. Some AIBs might have increased power limits which may help
Keep in mind the fe card has pretty tight power limits in vbios go sub if you wanna get a big ic w/o hardware mods
10-25% is a pretty high expectation.
"I'd be surprised if you can get much more OC performance out of them. The reality is that they're already factory OC'd, that's half the reason they're consuming so much power and idle at higher temperatures. This is Nvidia trying to make their performance target out of reach for AMD, and says a lot about how concerned they are about the Big Navi launch.

I'm sure there'll be people who can get 10-15% more frames... but they won't mention the glitches and bugs that occur due to calculation errors.

It's not the first time they've done this, e.g. with the 780 Ti they had similar power requirements in order to beat the R9 290X. And with the 780Ti, overclocking couldn't squeeze out as much extra performance as other Nvidia cards could at the time.

The interesting thing is that this time the timing is the other way around - Nvidia's launching first, and AMD's going to follow within just a couple of months."
"If you see GNs video, you'll see the efficiency of the chip drops a lot when oc'ed. Add to that AIBs coming pre over clocked, I doubt there will be much room left."
By all account AIBs coolers for the 3080 seem worse than nvidia's design with leaks saying that nvidia's FE cooler costs $150 per card.
"We'll have to wait a couple weeks for the custom AIBs with raised power limits to see the true OC potential. I have no choice but to get the EVGA XC3 line which unfortunately may get me 2-5% less than FE numbers. 

Hopefully we'll be able to flash the bios for higher power limits with these cards. I flashed my 2080 Ti FE so I could get to 123% but funnily enough I ended up limiting to 86% with my 150MHz OC to keep thermals down. I only lost 2-3 fps in 4K by having the power limit down so even then 15% increase may only be achievable in very few game engines."
DLSS will be so much better once DLSS 3.0 comes out and you can use it in pretty much any game.
What are you running?
Linus Tech Tips stated in there video the GPU consistently boosted to 2Ghz on load. Making AIBs imo irrelevant with there overclocks. Plus with a waterblock. Think ill be going FE edition
"The 3080 founders edition is power limited to ~375w. In that case it is only about 30% better than a 2080 ti. Some of the AIB will push this over 400w. So still a significant improvement, but not enough for a lot of people to upgrade if they have something recent."
I'm on a 1060 and WILL cry if I don't get one! LOL
[deleted]
"I'm the same.  Have a 2080 FE and it stays above 100 fps in most games, hoping to get above 140 consistently at 1440p.  If I somehow do miss out than it's not that bad."
Do you have 144hz monitor? I heard that for every hz you can get 2 fps. Or something like that. So if you have 60hz monitor you are capable of getting 120 fps if ur other parts allow for it. I could be wrong
[deleted]
"You seem like a good candidate for a 3070, or even better a used 2080 Ti so you don't have to play the waiting game. If the 3080 can barely squeak by the 2080 Ti in a few games I really doubt the 3070 is going to be totally on par with a 2080 Ti. Any leftover money should go towards a better CPU for 1080p ultra settings 144+ fps."
HAve you considered just looking at the benchmarks yourself lol. There's even a summary at the top.
beats the tar out of a 2080 S
When i bought the 2080Ti it sold out within the first half hour
dude! dont make our plan obvious!
Doubt you'll need more than a 650w Psu if it's a quality unit and you go for a 4700x to match the 3080. Power draw won't go above 500w unless you have a ton of extra stuff in your system
"Trust me, I've been debating on what I should upgrade first since the reveal of Ampere, but I think I'm gonna stick with buying a 3080 now and waiting for Ryzen 4000 series. I watched Gamers Nexus' [Skylake revisted video](https://youtu.be/LCV9yyD8X6M) from 2019, and the 6700K still holds its own at 1440p when overclocked. I have mine clocked at 4.5GHz, so not quite as high as in the video, but it's decent.

While I don't disagree that the high-end Ryzen chips are faster than a 6700K, the difference may be smaller than you expect. As you can see in the video, in some scenarios, an overclocked 6700K matches, or sometimes even outperforms (within a few %) a 3900X. Even at 1080p. At 1440p the gap is made even smaller."
I'm over here with an overclocked 5820k and a 1080ti and can't think of a single vr game that keeps me cpu bound. Everything for me is gpu bound when it comes to vr.
"I just upgraded from my 4690k a couple months to the 3600x, using that till sometime next year if the 4000 series is really worth upgrading to."
"Same here, at 1080ti + 8700k but won't be upgrading this year. Waiting for next gen CPUs, which will bring in the 4000 gen cards. So, maybe next year. I play at 1440p so I don't seem to be missing out on a lot here."
2x Performance(in minecraft and quake RTX)!!!!!!
"That's true, it's a much better price point, but I expected around 100% more performance compared to my 5700 XT (which obviously is weaker than a 2080 non super).

Not even getting that stings.. so I guess I'll wait for AIB cards or possibly RDNA2 (though I'll buy Nvidia due to drivers, AMD would have to do a homerun for me to consider them again on the GPU side)."
"I have a 1070ti wich is very close to the 1080, but the 3080 is out of my budget since my Credit card limit is 600$. When they announced them i was for sure going to get a 3070, but after this reviews, the 3080 actually have the performance they promised for the 3070, so the 3070 it's gonna be around 30% worse, so around 2080 actual performance. Spending 500$ to upgrade from a 1070ti to a 2080 is totally not worth it.   


We'll see what happens when the 3070 benchmarks come out, maybe they are not as bad as the 3080 benchmarks."
Yeah 3x  the peformance at 1440p is really great for that money. Can´t wait. I just hope i can snack one tomorrow.
2700x here
6700k and yes I'm gonna upgrade to zen3 and later this year to zen3.
12GB in a 384bit bus.
Yeah ive been keeping my eye on some. But i want to stay im the 500-600 dollar range.
"I like the productivity of having 3 separate monitors. Easier to use multiple fullscreen windows. I even use Linux with a tiling window manager, so I'm like the best case for a single ultrawide, but I still prefer the triple monitor setup."
Same! Lets go guys
"Look out for the Dell 1440p 165hz TN panel, it's a 10-bit panel that rivals most low/mid-range IPS 144hz panels."
Ips all the way.
"I have 3440X1440 120hz and a 4k 60 HDR tv.  I’ll take the TV any day over the monitor, but the monitor is very nice."
What would it take for you? 3090 is only supposed to be 20% more than 3080 so it’d be what 40-50% better than 2080ti if we are lucky? Would that be enough for the cost?
"Why not? Seriously though, some people are still selling their 2080ti for around $600. You could sell your 2080ti and buy a 3080 for a mere $99 difference. Is a 30% performance not worth $99 to you? Let me ask you another way, when you bought your 2080ti, would you have paid $99 extra for a 2080ti model that was 30% faster?"
Good luck friend
"If I wanted all my current games and the stuff coming out from now until the next card release to run in 1080p at 60 fps would you say that's impossible? Highly unlikely unless the game is buggy or something.

I am looking for the same thing but for 4k 60fps. I will pay whatever it costs to get as close to that as possible. If that's a 3090 then I will get it. If it's still not possible I will get a 3090 and enjoy that until the next card releases that holds promise. 

I get what you are saying Watch Dogs 3 maxed out with ray tracing on may not run 4k 60fps on my  i9-10900X and 3090 FTW. But I will get as close as I can. Like I doubt Flight Sim will get to 4k 60fps on a 3090 but I will still try.  

Once 8K becomes normal maybe that will be my goal in 10 years but for now my goal for the past 5 years has been 4K 60fps stuff maxed."
">	2k uhd gaming 

Okay. First of all, contrary to how many people erroneously refer to it as such, 2k resolution is not a thing in computer monitors. 2k is basically cinematic 1080p and it is NOT 1440p. Second, “UHD” refers specifically to 4K. The resolution you are referring to with those two terms literally does not exist."
"Meh, guess it depends what games you play.

In RDR2 the 3080 was 10% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti at 1440p. On top of that the 3080 was pulling 363w which is crazy.

In STR the 3080 is 20% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti.

I understand it's a monster of a card due to all the new bells and whistles but I was under the impression that it was at least 30% faster across the board in most popular titles. 

Gonna pass this time and wait for either the 3070 or BN."
Let me know as well please
"I've been saying this since the announcement, but because Jay said it, everyone will stop bitching. Hooray."
"The warmish comment made me laugh. He's never been very scientific, but I love his content."
"You're welcome.

I use a 360mm DeepCool AIO and the radiator is mounted in the front - I modded the case front panel a bit to allow for more airflow since it *supports* front radiator placement, but it is not ideal for it."
"Jaystwocents described the air being pushed to the cpu / ram as ""warmish"".  From his review I think the temps there are a non-issue."
"I'm all noctua and I think the 120mm exhaust on top will just about fit with a NH-U12s! Funny how I was sold on the strix originally but on second thought, £200 extra for what would be even more heat for maybe not a lot of extra perforamance is not that encouraging anymore. I expect the FE demand to be crazy but I'll give it a go and see how it plays out! Good luck if you do the same!

I'll post any good CPU tower cooler tests I find here."
Well I didn't explicitly state Linus as a reviewer of an open test bench. Does he state the cpu cooler or case with fans used for his testing?
"My Ryzen 3600 is chilling at 25-35% load while the 1060 is sweating for its life, lol. How the tables will turn!"
I wonder if my i5 8600k will be the bottle neck now
"I got my vr headset when I still had a 980ti. It was good, but I wanted much higher super sampling for a clearer image (OG Vive). The 980ti struggled with that. Moving up to the 1080ti hit that sweet spot. There are very few demanding vr games that my machine struggles with on 200% SS, elite dangerous being the main one. I expect the 3080 to totally smash my 1080ti vr performance. The 3090 would be even better."
"I'm really excited to see the difference from my 1080 on my Vive Pro.

"> while it's still running quieter and slightly cooler even than I'm currently used to

You probably already know this, but I wanted to point it out just in case. While the cooler may be more efficient and the die might have a lower temperature than your 5700XT, overall it is producing ~100W more of heat so your room will in fact get hotter. The 3080 is a hotter card, it's just better at dissipating that heat."
"Well maling it 30% slower than the 3080 seems reachable.

70% of the performance at 67% of the cuda cores - most likely being more efficient - just a bit memory starved"
"Yeah, I have a 1070, so I don't really care tbh. It's all a huge upgrade for me."
The 3070ti was already confirmed 2 weeks ago thanks to lenovo letting out a leak of it. It's to have 16gb's of memory.
"I hope it's performance justifies the cost.

Oh boy with the community be salty (me included) if it's only like 15-20% better than the 3080.

I'd say make it 30% better and we're good. Will totally dominate my 1080ti at that amount, we're talking like 100% performance increase right there almost!"
[deleted]
The review I read showed that it sat around 70-71 degrees. I thought that was decent given the power it consumes. What am I missing? Are you talking from an OC perspective?
Machining heat sinks like that is very expensive
"I don't expect that the 3090 will perform alot better than the 3080 (10% at most). That's the reason why I'm going for the 3080. I could easily afford the 3090, but the huge price difference is simply not worth it for me."
"Both TVs have HDMI 2.1, so yes."
"Agreed on the 2080 Ti owners especially if they got it like a year or so ago. I do feel like if you got a 2080 recently and still within the return window, it's probably worth returning it and getting the 3080 though. Simply because this gets you access to improved RT cores plus RTX IO (which can be important for next gen games in the next year or two)."
That's why I said it's safe for the Pascal owners to upgrade now.
"The review that mentioned coil whine said it was only an issue at incredibly high frame rates, I think he said 300+. It didn't sound like it'd be an issue in normal scenarios."
What really? That's uncommon right?
Agreed.  I'm sort of curious how much power you could save if undervolted+underclocked to 90%-80% performance over stock. My guess is it would be pretty massive given they seem to be pushing these past where they're really efficient.
"It’s all preference, I tend to go EVGA but this time I’m going for a founders edition. Most of my friends go MSI for the cheaper cost and reliability."
"You’ll be happy no matter what then, best of luck to you"
Total system or just cpu and gpu?
You and I are pretty much the same person. I’m also switching from EVGA G3 650 to a Super Flower Leadex III 850. Next you’ll tell me you’re going from a 1080ti to a 3080 tomorrow..
"That's not what's I'm seeing from Steve:

"No offense here, but what do you mean? 

Cyberpunk 2077 is coming with Raytracing and DLSS right off the bat. This is next gen technology, isn't it?"
"It depends entirely on needs, budget and other upgrade plans, like going with higher res or higher refresh monitor, Ultrawide aspect ratio, etc.

Otherwise it's the never ending game of wait until the next big thing and you won't be at ease with your upgrades if you see it this way."
According to LTT reflex goes all the way back to maxwell
Reflex will be available on everything down to Maxwell.
Reflex will be supported all the way down to the gtx 900 series
Reflex is going back to the 900 series.
Reflex is coming to 20 series IIRC.
Well the problem was paying for a 2080ti in the first place
"I’d rather sell my 2080ti for 60% depreciation now than for 90% next year. That’d be a terrible idea.

Will go for the 3090 though but if I was a bit shorter on cash I’d take the 3080 in a heartbeat. 30%+ better performance and HDMI 2.1 which is the biggest selling point for me personally."
HDMI 2.1 is a huge deal for me. Probably getting the 3090 though.
yeah people who even consider to upgrade flagship cards each generation dont really care about price anyway
"Hard to say without seeing the cards. Especially since quite a few AIBs have fucked up thermal design on GPU/VRM/DRAM before so we'll have to wait and see.

But 10-20% improvement in sustained clock duration wouldn't be surprising."
"With no power limit, cooler temperatures I would say at least 8-10% depending if you can OC memory or not."
"Yes if the power limit is removed.

The FE cannot sustain it's power so the clocks drop up and down everywhere.

Look at the blue graph.

https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/images/clocks-and-thermals.png

If you removed the power limit it would sustain and stay at 1890 MHz, but instead you have it dropping up and down to 1815 MHz. That's without an OC set. If the 3080 follows similar OC as the 20 series, some people will probably hit 2010 MHz OC comfortably with ease with no power limits."
"We need to identify which are references. Some might be close to reference, but have different power deliveries set in place for higher power draw. But I can't imagine any of them going above 370W with only 2x 8-pins."
"The problem with the FE, it is a custom board this time around.

Flashing was mostly successful on reference board flashing other cards that are close to reference.

So I wouldn't get my hopes that high, at least not have that expectation. If it works, then great!"
"Just FYI, FE isn't the reference design."
"I'm in Australia, and it seems like there are about 20 available in the whole country"
"That's the only thing that's peeving me a bit, really. All the fun OC cards are in these RGB Bayformers shrouds that I've just grown tired of seeing and the understated ones are either blowers (good luck with blowers for this gen) or no better than Founders."
"The tuf series is pretty basic looking. I myself never cared for the rgb/silly shroud nonsense either. I want all my attention on the the screen and audio, not the whirs and glows of the nearby pc box."
The FE is the only one with (half-a-blower)
">  but will be gone in 60 seconds.

You forgot the decimal point.

They'll be gone in 0.60 seconds."
If youre not overclocking just get the FE
"Certainly don't take my word for it but from the reviews so far (main being gamersnexus) the FE cards at stock settings are strong but power limited, so OC'ing them didn't gain much.  If you don't plan to overclock anyway, it's probably a solid choice in terms of price/performance.  AIB's are already showing $150+ over msrp for 3080."
"This is exactly what I want to know. At this point noise is the decider for me, especially coming off a noisy 3fan 1080 (Windforce, appropriately enough..)"
ty
Good question. Hard to say at this point. In addition if you go by the Steam hardware survey metrics a shit ton of people are still on 1080p so people moving towards even 1440p is probably going to be a while. Probably will happen by the 4000 series.
"Yeah just got done watching jayz2cents and he also ran all bench at the three resolutions. 

It honestly seems like my biggest problem will be my old ass i7 which will bottle neck the crap out of this.  But going 3070 won't save enough for a new mobo and cpu , so I might Atwell just go stupid with it and get the 3080 and slowly build a system around it."
[deleted]
Happy for ya man 🥳. I'm pretty on the fence  still
[deleted]
Same here the 2070 Super has been nice for the time being but the increased performance from the 3080 is too tempting (given I can get one tomorrow morning)
"yeah well Jay was like the only one i heard mention it, people keep comparing the 3080 to the 2080 Ti.  But based on everything we know that is not the right comparison.  

If you actually compare it to the og 2080 (same price point) its like on of the biggest jumps between generations ever. But well people keep comparing an 700$ Card to a 1200$ Card ??? You can do this the moment the actual 3080 Ti gets released and judge off of that."
Thanks man. Great sources too
I really think that chart they showed us threw us for quite a whirl ngl
Oh thats really helpful thank you!
Yeah so a 3080 is 50% faster...
"Yeah really hoping for a ti launch. Maybe it'll be useful in VR but for 1440p gaming, I need a bigger jump to switch. Especially given turing won't lack any next gen features"
"I'm in the same boat. The 1440p gains over the 2070 super are between 50 and 60% most of the time, and I'm not sure that's worth the upgrade yet."
"Still undecided. It seems AIBs will have more marging for OC and less power consumption, but who knows..."
3090? Isn't that still under NDA for another week.
"Nothing scientific but taking a look at benchmarks for the stock 2080 ti that I could compare to and then my own experience and max performance seen from my card at its full oc showed some pretty significant gains not everything was 20% no but I did see numbers that were in a couple of scenarios I would save on average across the board 10 or 15% but definitely saw situations where stock was getting 42 and I was seeing 50.

My card was running at up to 2.2ghz though settled in the 2125 to 2185 range"
stop being logical with me 😂
Awk
We could keep thos going....
Nvidia literally said you should have a minimum of 750w
yeah people here are pretty stupid. Ampere is an impressive improvement
"""up to 2x vs 2080""

OMG NOT 2X EVERYWHERE"
"I think people are mostly grumpy because it's honestly a bit misleading. Why would nVidia show such a complicated scenario rather than like, a scenario that we could realistically encounter? Maybe, just maybe, to make the card seem a like it's more efficient than it is?"
"If you compare the 2 cards locked at the same fps, the 3080 is more efficient. But because the 3080 can hit much higher fps, when you're looking at uncapped fps the max power draw the 3080 hits is higher"
"If in 2 years Nvidia manages to secure TMSC 5nm we  might see even bigger jump in performance with much less power consumption. 

Apple's new iPad SoC on 5nm will have 11.7 billion transistors, almost as much as 2080 Super. Absolute madness. And before their iPad chips had the ""X"" at the end while this like iPhone's SoC doesn't, so in all likelihood this will be in the next iPhone! Which is crazy because iPhone SoC die sizes are only around 100mm^2, so this should be around that number too. I don't even dare to imagine how a Turing sized die would perform, probably enough for 8k 144hz+ gaming."
"> Samsung 8N sucks power like crazy after a certain frequency.
> 
> TSMC 7nm or even 5nm will provide huge gains.

And yet, the 3080 is only 50W more than the 5700XT (TSMC 7nm) yet offers 2x the performance.

AMD is claiming they're getting a 60% improvement per watt with RDNA2. I wouldn't call that ""huge.""

5nm might help quite a bit though, but we have a while to wait for that yet."
"Hmm, this is about the ""foundry"" right

(1) Do you think the drop of the power usage can be significant under the range of safe ""undervolting"" for the 3080? anyway that also makes me more curious to see the undervolt results of RTX3080

(2) The TSMC 7nm was the one used by Zen 2 right, will the XBOX SX and PS5 CPU and GPU also use the TSMC 7nm?"
I see this assertion thrown around a lot. But not much science to back it up. Lots of people blaming the high power consumption on samsung 8nm. But I don't see any proof.
"Wow fantastic technology insight, Thanks for sharing. Never realized that thermal runaway can occur not only in a chemical reactor/plant but also in a chip."
"Cannot speak for all for sure, but as soon as I know SFF world and become one of them I care much a lot more about optimization in terms of performance, space, power/heat than ever before. There is the SFF750 PSU to eat the power requirements of 3080 easily and called it a day but personally an improvement in terms of perf/watt would be a huge welcome after 250W of RTX2080S and Ti in the top end segment."
"Sustainability, electricity cost, more power usage equals more heat that requires more cooling and therefore possibly more noise if you use air cooling,  less opportunity to OC, having the PC as a space heater is not comfortable. Just a few to think of ;-)"
My mancave gets hot very quickly and that's with only with 250W GPU
Tell that to everyone on this sub and even outside of it which have given AMD shit for years for not having as good performance per watt.
"efficiency is elegance

does it really matter? no. is it nice? yea."
"321/228. 40.7%. so yeah I was off a little lol

">>Uses 50% more power than a FE 2080ti for not 50% more fps?
>
>For the vast majority of titles, the 3080 is nowhere near 50% faster than the 2080Ti. That's including the RTX/DLSS titles where the 3080 should theoretically excel.

Hence the ""not 50% more"". So a perf/watt regression"
"Ah, yeah I guess that's true.  Fair enough."
Wouldn't worry about it if I were you. It only matters for OC.
If you don't have planned to OC its wouldn't you matters too much. Having better power delivery can still help you you sustain higher clocks when combined with with good cooling though.
"Are you seriously asking why a 2080ti owner would compare his OC'd 2080ti vs a new GPU? to see if it's an upgrade of course. I think you are looking the wrong way at benchmarks..they are not meant for people to see who has the biggest shlong..it's to see if it's an upgrade for the person in question VS his or hers current own Setup. So yes, off course 2080ti owners would check if the card is faster than their OC'd cards they are using. That's the whole reason people look at benchmarks. Of course once the AIB partners release their 3080versions with unlocked bios, higher power limits i want to see those perform in their OC mode vs the 2080ti as well. That is how you get the complete picture.  
    
Do you even have a 2080ti? If not, why would you care what those owners want to compare?"
Still a good source of info :) Anandtech is my go to and very disappointed that i don't have it today
"Check the ending of hardware unboxed. It explains how 4k uses some of the FP feature of the 3080 but 1440 resolution does not.

This comment sums up what Steve says. 


https://reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/itw87x/geforce_rtx_3080_review_megathread/g5h3qx8"
"For what it's worth that's not what I'm seeing in benchmarks.
It's 21 percent average at 1440, 32 percent at 4k.

The 3070 has a big gap to fill, but I expect it to trade blows with the 2080ti at 1440."
Most likely because of the higher bandwidth theb3080 can use for higher resolutions. Or then3080is maybe cpu bottle necked in some titles even at 1440p?
"What do you mean like vs like? Why would anyone do that when looking if its an upgrade or not. Once the oc 3080versions are out we can compare those with ocd 2080tis.but for now all we have is the 3080fe numbers so you compare those vs what you already got. We also know almost all 2080tis run easily in the 2000mhz range even the fe version. The 3080fe didnt oc so well for gamers nexus.. So im looking forward to the 3080 from aib partners and the 3090 benches

20% at 4k is a lot. But in reality if your previous card was getting 40fps..you are now doing 48fps.yaay?not really new heights of gaming. Its why i personally dont play at 4k..i wont untill fps numbers hit at least 100fps."
"Part of the reason that the 3080 is out-performing in those resolutions is because of the faster GDDR6X VRAM. The 3070 will have 8GB of GDDR6 with 256-bit memory bus vs 11GB 352-bit memory bus. I imagine the higher the resolution you play at, the more likely you'll see the 2080 TI coming out on top vs the 3070. The only way I see the 3070 outperforming the 2080 TI is in RTX + DLSS 2.0."
They gaslit you into believing that $700 is a good price by price gouging last gen. Nice!

I’m in the UK and no companies have their own stock. Can only order for Nvidia.
Definitely not worth it for me to go to an unknown website with iffy reviews and in a language I dont know. Especially now that the prices are probably hike up everywhere. Its a shame Nvidia gave the time it was going to sell from and didn't implement a purchase limit or simple captcha.
"I wouldn't be. I work in customer service, I've seen it all. You'd just think the people on the enthusiast communities would pay a *little* more attention."
"Yeah, this is correct, my bad."
From what I've heard it's 24 hours after the review embargo lifts so yes 9AM EST.
right but the game's physics are tied to the frame rate and if you go above 60 fps it breaks ALOT of things.
They are currently on #4 on my queue so i'll let you know once i read it lol!
"So not much yet then. I think it will be beneficial, but as with any new technology it take a while to be implemented by everyone and optimized to its fullest potential.

Edit: and let me know when doom internal has it."
Who knows maybe it will see some life in my sister's pc when she grows up a bit. But until then I suppose display shelf will do.
"you're getting more fps for less $.  i still don't understand your argument.  even if the gain is 5fps at 1080p and not noticeable since fps is over 200, the $700 3080 is still the better value over a new $1,000 2080ti.

your comment only makes sense for current 2080ti owners.  it may not be worthwhile to sell a $1k gpu for $600 and then buy a $700 gpu for a 25% increase in fps."
"For example, the boost clock on the Founders Edition model is 1710 MHz while the EVGA FTW Ultra has a 1800 MHz boost. Other models from competitors will likely have a similar spec product lineup."
Here's Ryan's tweet: https://twitter.com/RyanSmithAT/status/1304577222351577088
"Well, I guess it depends on what GPU you already have and how much money are you willing to spend. I have a GTX 1060 and the jump in performance will be huge for me with a 3080 regardless of the slight bottleneck. And I don't have enough money to change my whole rig just yet, so that works for me. Especially for GPU rendering... those sweet, sweet CUDA cores. :)"
I want to say I heard some reviewer say that he received new drivers with his review card. Don't quote me on that though.
"the board uses a LGA 1151 - 300 series, so the socket is the best you can get.

the ""K"" just means its unlocked, so you can overclock it. The ""KS"" comes with a higher boost and base clock speed.

[Its absolutely an upgrade, the 9900 pulls punches with threadripper CPUs.](https://www.techcenturion.com/cpu-rankings)

Yours is towards the lower-middle of the chart.

The difference between a 9900 and 10900 isnt worth the upgrade, but upgrading from a lower end to a upper end of the socket is definitely worth it."
"I don't have much experience with high-end PSU as the most I've ever bought was 700W (back in 2011)

But for brands the two that I would recommend are Seasonic (or Antec since they are Seasonic re-labeled) and Corsair (RMx or HX, not Green or CX label). I recommend these because I live in an old house (70-80 yr) with old electrical wiring. I've used Thermaltake and Cooler Master PSU and for some reason they made my graphics cards (different computers) whine, a lot. Switching to a few other different brands until settled on Seasonic and Corsair. Now all PCs in my house are quiet."
"Not quite. Despite pulling 650w from the outlet, A Gold rated PSU is only 90% efficient under normal circumstances.

>[80 PLUS GOLD CERTIFIED This certification guarantees a typical efficiency of 90% under normal operating conditions.](https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/power-supplies/mwe-series/mwe-gold-650-full-modular/)

yeah i thought that was a little much but thought id put it out there because it was basically in their headline
That’s with everything on ultra max settings. If you lower anti aliasing and post processing you’ll get over 100. Maybe put some stuff on high that has low visual impact but high performance impact.

FS has more issues with CPU than GPU.
"> In Flight simulator at 1440p the 3080 is only 7% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti. To me that is just crazy, of course in other games it demolishes the 2080ti but man was I expecting better when it comes those 2 titles.

"Tech is keeping everyone sane.

I feel fortunate that I kept 80% of my hours, so that money I’d normally use for vacation is just getting reallocated to a new GPU lol. I’m rocking a 1060 currently, so I’m in need of an upgrade. Very glad I held off the 2070S."
"I have several new to gaming and pc in general friends who have asked for help build their first gaming pc. They are all still working thankfully, but have $1k-$2k laying around that was for vacations. A nice new TV and a gaming pc keeps the family entertained pretty well."
I got super lucky and received a $750 cash back bonus from my credit card the other day.
"No sorry, I meant to put 15%. I'm currently feeding a bunch a bunch of salamander by hand."
I hear if you can get the card to hit 400w it will undergo  nuclear fusion
"Sorry edited my post, should be 15%"
Just a smidge lol
"I think they will be. Otherwise AIB wouldn't focus on making super beefy coolers and 3x 8 pins.

If the AIBs performed on par with the FE, reviewers will destroy them. So there's a reason why Gigabyte Extreme card is aiming for 55C with their massive 4 slot card. They probably will take advantage of all the extra boost clocks due to power temperatures, take advantage of that 3x pin and whatever OC you can get with their binned card.

I'm certain the AIB will at least get 8-10% extra on average with the extra power and beefier coolers over the FE stock."
"The FE only had 370W to play with.

The high end AIB will have lower temperatures which can give more boost and they'll also supply greater than 370W. Up to at least 513W, but I don't that, probably more like 400-425W"
"As a mechanical engineer, I can guess that the FE cooler can be more expensive because

1. The fin arrangement isn't a straightforward design, they are all angles so some assembly or procedures are required to shape it

2. The fins are machined andncutnout to fit the fans

The cost of the FE cooler can be higher due to the manufacturing of it, not necessarily because of extra material which would have increases performance.

The AIBs will cool the cards better. They're very beefy, super long and many have passthroughs now."
I sold my 2080 Ti Seahawk. Currently running at backup 980.
"Linus Tech Tips also had their temperatures down to get the card at 71C. That's kind of an outlier compared to all the other reviewers so I don't know. 

Tech Power Up stated that heated the card and case up for I believe 30 minutes before they started their test to negate any initial cool boot-ups. I haven't watched Linus video, but did they do anything like that? Or did they wait for the card to cool down?"
"Seems around  40 to 50%, that isn't bad.  The short version seems to be 1080p don't upgrade, 4k definitely upgrade, and 1440p, it depends what you play."
"What's with the aggression?

You would expect the less a game uses, the more frames you get.

If you play CSGO, you'll only see a marginal difference.  So don't act like it's obvious for consumers."
"Yeah, that's a fair point.

I mean, honestly, I'll just get the 3080 because I can.  This 1070 has done a lot for me, and I can see myself sitting on the 3080 for the next 5 years."

Only reason I thought I needed more psu was checking it out with a PSU calculator online. I was hoping for a 4900x or equivalent. Plus NVIDIA's PSU requirements say that too. Oh well. No rush right now.
"The difference is as you say quite low indeed on single threads, but as soon as multicore steps in it'll definitely be blown away. The reason I brought VR up is because the multiple threads on my CPU is astonishingly bad, while regular 1440p gaming is fine. If you're doing anything else such as streaming or recording, or having many stuffs going on it might be rough.

The 3900X has nearly 300% higher performance than i7-6700k in Geekbench, in multicore specifically, so it all depends on what you do with your PC. If you're only playing normal games at 1440p you'll probably like you said, not see much difference!"
Perhaps he has a really low resolution HMD?
"On they rumor mill leading up to the launch, I heard numerous times that ray tracing performance would be at least 2x. These rumors are likely fed by the marketing department to small media outlets (like tech youtubers) to generate buzz. That's why the mantra ""wait for benchmarks"" is sacrosanct."
Yep. Nvidia's charts are always exaggerated. Still a better jump in price to performance than we got from Turing. I'm waiting for the RDNA 2 launch to make a decision. AMD has to offer a more compelling product for me. I have no hang ups buying from either company.
[TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/34.html) is showing the 3080 doing double the performance of the 5700xt at both 1440p and 4K.
"""100% more performance compared to my 5700 XT"" it is (or very close to) at 4k. Gains will always be smaller on lower resolution because of a multitude of factors."
"It's pretty clear that the 3070 will be around the 2080 Ti in terms of performance, seeing how the 3080 is \~20% - 30% better at 1440p.

The only way a 3070 is not a worthwhile upgrade from a 1070 Ti is if you're planning to play in 1080p, in which case... why bother upgrading at all?"
Best Buy has a credit card with no interest for 18 months on purchases over $499. Just saying...
It's an easy 2X performance over a GTX 1080 but I have yet to see a game running 3x.
2x?
You gonna upgrade that too?
"I bought one of the knock-off ones for 600 USD equivalent (in a country that overcharges like mad for tech) and its been really good to me so far. No dead pixels, lives up to the specs on the box, pushes my 2080ti in most games at 3440x1440@144Hz. Perhaps I got lucky, but if I didn't you could probably get a solid one for good prices."
"I had triple monitors before having ban ultrawide and second 27"". I'd never switch back."
this is what I have and I absolutely love it.
That's what I'm leaning towards.
That’s a massive upgrade though. People were upgrading from 1080ti to 2080tis with less of a performance increase.
"You could at least try and be less pompous, maybe you might even get some friends. Or, you could just continue correcting grammar and fickle marketing terms to feed your intellectual superiority complex. 2560x1440 is not 1080, although i may have used the wrong buzz words. Get out of your own ass."
My 1080 is bigger than normal GPu sizing and it fits im prty confident the 3080 will fit in my Silverstone SG
"You were speculating, this is tested and hopefully solid data, there is a significant difference there.  
  
Consumers and Enthusiasts have every right to be skeptical and ask questions when there is an absence of data from the manufacturer."
"I will check, maybe I’m overestimating the thickness of my spare Noctua fans and I can fit one.

I agree that Strix seems like a waste, I was just thinking about something that is max $50 more than FE.  I’m running a mildly-OCed GTX 980, so anything will be a significant improvement."

"rip me still on a kaby lake i7. Still probably gonna upgrade my gpu first, but i'm getting the 3060 or equivalent whenever it comes out. I might upgrade my cpu next year, if i have the cash."
I cant wait to run DCS with more detail.
You should see pretty overwhelming uplift considering you won't have any CPU bounding issues whatsoever.
"From my understanding Black variants are the bottom of the barrel, and also have no backplate. The regular XC3 and the Ultra variant will be their mainline option, with the Ultra probably having a slight factory OC."
"Very, especially because I use open back headphones and keep volume quiet to not risk any damage to my hearing. It's like permanently having a wind turbine in the background."
"Yeah I did know that indeed haha but thanks for pointing it out anyway as it is indeed something that gets overlooked a lot. 

The general ambient temperature in my room is very manageable though so I'm not too worried about it, also airflow in my case is supposed to be really decent. 

But I guess I won't find out until I have one installed in my case :p"
oh really? Sweeeet. Maybe Ill upgrade sooner.
"Yeah I’m getting the EVGA FTW ultra 3090 and my 1080 Ti is going to my sister lol

Basically the 3090 looks dope in all the NVIDIA creative demos they showed with the 24 GB of gddr6x ram"
You clearly did not watch any Videos...
It is louder than a 2070/2080 Super FE and twice as loud vs my current AIB 1070.
"Yeah, absolutely not worth the price increase, that's for sure. I'd expect the performance gap to be a bit bigger than 10% though tbf. We all know a 3080 ti will be incoming shortly, and that's going to have to be a decent bit faster at stock than an OC'd 3080, otherwise they won't be able to charge an extra $300 for it (or whatever they decide to charge)."
you have no idea what u are talking about. 10% for an extra $800 bucks? ILOL JUST LOL
"Thanks, it’s a really good TV, we choose well."
I replied to the wrong person
https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/39.html
I'd like to see the dBA saving too.
I'm guessing it's for the full build.
"Nope. 2070 Super.

Luckily for me, the PSU was compatible with my CableMod cables so it was an easy swap. I followed GamersNexus's video on comparing the cables with a DMM and they worked perfectly."
He's probably talking about RTX IO.
"Ooh good to know! In that case, yeah, I'm pretty much okay to chill on the 2080 TI and wait for a refresh or see how bad I run Cyberpunk."
That's an insane clock speed drop on a stock card.
Thanks for the thorough answer!
"fair enough! never really understood the ""rules"" for which vBIOS you can flash on to which card. i guess i will keep my fingers crossed then!"
What? I thought reference referred to stock NVIDIA designed cards.
What's wrong with blowers?
Whats a blower?
Ye i believe i will - thanks for the answer.
"Thanks for the answer. Im getting the same read from a lot of sources, so i will probably stick with FE."
"I don't want to say this is all i care about, but it's not, *not* all I care about. My current system sounds like a jet taking off and I'm sick of it."
"1440p monitors just have to get cheaper, hopefully that happens"
Yep and BB sold out instantly. the coming soon switched to notify me and then to sold out
"I was happy with my 2070 super a year ago when I built my PC. But after recently getting a new monitor it just does not cut it anymore. 2070 super is great for 1080p but any higher and it's not worth it. For me personally 60fps is unplayable but some consider that the ""sweet spot"". I need 100+ to not feel that sluggish gameplay."
"Dude it's 75%~ better than the 2070 super in most games. I just upgraded to a 38"" ultra wide 1600p monitor. The 2070 super isn't cutting it. The 3080 is everything I wanted and more"
I can play Alyx on my Index with 120hz and 150% SS so i'm happy with my 2070s :D
"How much of that is gpu limitation and not CPU?

And how much more gain could you want at 1440p? This card is pretty much maxing out 144 at 1440p."
"Because they’d rather be safe than sorry, especially with people using low quality 750W PSUs that’ll blow out"
"The 3080 and Ampere in particular can't be undervolted according to several reviewers

Yes, Xbox SX and PS5 are using 7nm TSMC"
"the german magazine Computerbase was able to lower the power limit to 270W, which only reduced the performance by around 4%

 [https://www.computerbase.de/2020-09/geforce-rtx-3080-test/6/](https://www.computerbase.de/2020-09/geforce-rtx-3080-test/6/)"
"There's the SFF crowd and generally people who want smaller PC's. More power = more heat which is difficult to get rid of in a small case.

Then there's also a lot of people who don't have AC in their homes and a PC is basically a space heater. Sweating while playing video games isn't much fun."
"I'm not really interested in the AMD vs. Nvidia war.

So the answer seems to be it doesn't matter?"
"Why would you compare an OC'd card to a non OC'd card. If you want to understand the impact of buying the new gpu, and you are someone who OC's, you would probably OC the new card as well.

So if OC 2080ti to 3080 is a 15% gain, then OC to OC might be a 20% gain. 

That is a solid step up, and even more of a difference at 4k. If you are gaming at 1440p, and have a 2080ti why would you even consider this card. 1440p is pretty much capped with a 2080ti.

This card in mainly for 4k and it offers a big jump from a 2080ti."
Bless you 🙏
"If you're comparing a non-OCed card vs an OCed card, you're not making a direct comparison. You either compare stock with stock, or OCed with OCed. Anything else is just nonsense."
Unless you're scandinavian i wouldnt.
"EDIT: Okey, i checked it again and it was power limit reduced to 83%. So with undervolt it should be much better, if undervolting can be unlocked at all."
"it has it on pc with pro windows . that a bit different then home..

atm it loads so fast the only slow part is the lang and title screen.

mind you i  have this on a threadripper  mobo with tons of lanes"
"I currently own a 2080ti. So I guess my point makes sense.

Everyone is comparing the new retail prices of both cards as an even baseline. No one in the right mind would consider a new 2080ti when a new 3080 is available too. A safe thought is that just about every single person paying attention to the Ampere news already has a GPU, so most of us are doing a cost to benefit analysis based on what we already have... 

Some folks seem to just focus on the just the information exactly as it is presented: Yes, a new 3080 is a far better value when considering a new 2080ti. But when a person steps back and considers the reality of their own situation, most of us see that we have an existing GPU and setup to compare actual, tangible value to."
Thanks wish Nvidia would have supported it ;-;
Nice... I'm gonna go pick up my 9900k tomorrow thanks man!
"Not true. Efficiency means that in order to supply 50W, for example, a 50% efficient PSU would need to draw 100W from the wall. The supply is the same, the power consumption is worse."

"At 4K 3080 vs 2080 Super shows a 60% improvement on gamers nexus for avg fps? How is that shit optimization?

There are specific settings that significantly impact FPS for minor visual improvements, sure. So I guess you could call that poorly optimized, but they're options above and beyond what the game was originally designed for (consoles). So just...match the console settings if you're concerned about ""optimized"" settings. They exist. The option is there. If you don't want to fiddle with options, pick the medium or low preset. Or go buy a console. 

The game scales relatively well with resolution and if you deploy the right settings. It had some issues with low thread count CPUs originally but those have since been remediated."
"I will absolutely agree that it can be an excuse, but that's not a certainty, it's just an assumption."
"It's DX11 (for the time being) and doesn't make use of multi core very well while also being rough on CPU so it has nothing to do with ""GPU optimization"" or whatever."
"Yep, I've been happily building a new PC at home since April, like many others this year, with money I'd have spent on some random vacation and overpriced cocktails and meals somewhere."

Tech is also still hiring while the other industries are laying off.  A lateral move to tech would be a good career move.
"I just did a quick calculation, and I saved **nearly** enough for 3080 just on fuel thanks to remote work. So yeah."
Well except you can simply glance at a headline on your phone and your blood pressure levels rise almost instantaneously
"Can't forget all of the other money drains out there though for tech people. New iPhones coming out soon, Samsung S20 w/ 5G out now, HP Reverb G2 (for VR fans), saving up for a new console and potentially a VRR-capable monitor, etc. In this economy most people would be a bit crazy to get a 3090 when $1500 could get you a 3080, PS5, and 75% of a cheap monitor."
"Your patience paid off! I hope you grab one of the first batches. I am also fortunate to be employed right now with extra money. I feel a little guilty about it, but as far as vices go, gaming is a pretty harmless one."

"GamersNexus's day one OC was only able to get 4% more performance on 116% power draw. AIB with higher power limit and watercooling will do more, time to fine tune things and driver improvements will also help, but in general the 3080 platform doesn't seem to have much headroom to OC at this point."
Salamander tax?
Gamers nexus ran comparisons with an overclocked 3080 and it's not to impressive. Seems like they come near the limit out of the box.
Not according to GN. These cards are pretty much maxed out.
"Right, I assumed you were talking about the FE because I didn't read your comment properly. With better cooling, you'd be able to squeeze out a little more, I agree. I'm skeptical about just how much more, though. I guess we'll see!"
"“Only 370W”

And there was already barely any improvement going from 320W -> 370W. Imo this chip is already at its limit. Is it even worth it to get a few % more performance for substantially more power consumption and heat?"
"Any salamanders while writing this one?

Good insight!"
"That's not how it works though haha, you're bottlenecked immensely by the CPU at 1080p. These cards aren't aimed at 1080p, they're for 1440p 144hz, 4k, and up in resolution.

At the end of the day, get whatever card fits ones needs."

">	2560x1440 is not 1080p

You are correct, and [2k](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K_resolution) usually refers to 2048x1080, which is much closer to 1080p than 1440p (which is what 2560x1440 should be called). 

You are objectively wrong here, bud. Take the L and move on."
"The concerns always seemed a bit unfounded. Most open air designs dump all the heat inside the case, where they invariably get pulled by the CPU cooler anyway. This new design partially pushes the air from the warmest area directly outside the case while the other fan is at the coolest end of the heat sink. The air from that fan was never going to be too hot as long as the front fan was doing its job. One would think NVIDIA would have tested this thing before announcing it."
"No, it's not speculating. It's basic fluid thermodynamics :)

Translated, it looks good for us! _...the GeForce RTX 3080 does not directly cause higher CPU and RAM temperatures in any case - or has only a very minor influence on them._"
"I just had a looky and its great they included the graph for temperature change as its something very few reviewers have done so thanks for suggesting!

Which video showed it as loud? All the ones I watched said it was good
42dB while gaming seems reasonable to me. Definitely nothing you should use in a silent system but for everything else it looks good.
I haven't looked through all of the reviews yet (work and all). Do you remember which review mentioned that? I'd like to go watch/read it later.
Do you expect a bigger performance difference?
"I don't know why they said that with no context or reason.  This video seems to show a very successful undervolt:

My guess is if you're willing to take a bit of a performance hit (10-15%), you could make the card virtually silent."
Better be. Guess I'll be finding out soon enough.
"Oh that’s good to know. I don’t have custom cables , but it’s something I’ve always thought about. Thanks for that."
Was going to get a 2070 super with a 3900x on 650W a month ago and kinda felt there was still enough headroom to go straight to 3080 FE instead of waiting for the 3070.
"Remember, FE ain't even stock, it's custom this time. The AIB reference will perform less due to being capped at 340. They're going to rely on their cooling solution to get better boost clocks."
"Yeah, I had a friend brick a card because he flashed a zotac amp extreme on his reference card.

I managed to figure out a way for him to fix it and it was not pretty. He had to have another GPU in his system, put computer to sleep. Pull and swap the GPU while PC was asleep and then boot up again forcing power into his GPU.

Definitely wait for peo like him to test things out before you try haha."
"That's normally the case, founders edition cards stick to the reference design, same as the early 3rd party cards. This time around nvidia made their own custom version of their own reference design PCB for the founders edition cards.

&#x200B;

EDIT: If you look up pictures the FE cards have a v shape at the end of the card whereas the reference is your usual rectangular affair. I do wonder how many people are going to end up buying reference card water blocks for their Founder's Editions."

Aye. I think by the time next gen comes out 1440 will be standard just like 1080p is now. Especially since the lower level consoles are targeting 1440 as well.
any idea if we could maybe scoop one in store? I'll take the drive lol
"You're absolutely right! I hope I can snag one

">How much of that is gpu limitation and not CPU?

I don't know, but who cares when the CPU is already a 9700k or the 10th gen equivalent?

>And how much more gain could you want at 1440p? This card is pretty much maxing out 144 at 1440p.

I would like a consistent 144 fps if possible, but at least consistently getting over 120 FPS.  Assassin's Creed Odyssey, RDR2, and Control for example are around 90 FPS.  Next gen games are coming in the next 3 years and I would hope the 3080 can maintain high framerates for those games too.  An extra 15-20% gain would've helped me feel a bit more comfortable."
"Wow alright, thanks for the info and the chat, was holding my breath on undervolting results"
"Thanks for mentioning this, will look into it."
"The ""war"" wasnt the point, but clearly it must matter. At least when it comes to AMD according to this sub, so it would for nvidia as well you'd think."
"That's a good sign of things to come. Hopefully the new ryzen processors are as good as people are saying,  it should make things interesting."
"Just an FYI, replacing the CPU will require a new windows install. Just be prepared for that."
"Do your research first, your current motherboard might not be a good fit for the 9900K. Which mobo do you have?"
"So even after tax added to the purchase of the card, with 6 months to pay it off to beat the interest, it would only be $267.50 a month which is way easier to deal with than $1605 all at once.

Yea, I could prolly do that method, then I wouldn't have to wait 6 months for the 80ti to drop at potentially 500 bucks cheaper, but that's just a guesstimate..."
I’ve had a 3440 UW for 2.5 years now. Once you figure out your “I can’t even tell a difference” settings then you’ll have no qualms. Dropping into the 90s at times in single player games isn’t very noticeable either.
There tend to be a few settings (often volumetric fog/clouds) where the top setting is a large performance hit and it looks pretty much identical.

"In terms of manual OC, yes you are right. Year by year, Boost OC takes the fun away from manual OC. 

It seems Boost is pushing cards to their limits already. Auto OC has come a long way."

With the Founders Edition. AIB cards could be different.
Yeah and that kind of bums me out. I'll be looking at the AIBs more now...
"How are we going to know without seeing a card with more power delivery and a better cooling solution? 

Yes, the FE is certainly maxed out, but we can't say the other cards will be. The same thing happened to the 2080 Ti FE, it hit power limits. Low and behold the AIB cards with no power limits pushed performances to 20% with higher OCs. 

The FE is a custom card though. I don't expect that much performance over it, just 10% on the average. If a OC FE can do +5%, I don't see why a AIB can't squeeze out another 5% to make it  10%."
"> And there was already barely any improvement going from 320W -> 370W.

Guru3D got a 5% boost. Better than nothing."

"Yeah, that's pretty much the consensus.

I'll have to figure something out"
"Except esport gamers play at LESS than 1080p???

Is it the fault of the CPU? sure, but as it stands people that play for insane 300+ FPS will see little benefit to this GPU, and sure maybe 720p players can migrate to 1080p. But this card is NOT for CSGO, Valorant, Overwatch players that want to move to 1440p."
"Mostly to improve my 1% lows and reduce the variation and fluctuations.

Going from an uncapped 400hz to 244hz just because someone threw a smoke grenade is not how I like to live my life.

If the 3080 can help reduce that fluctuation, that would be worth it to me."
Cmon just jk
"Turing was actually better as well. I can't recall a generation that was worse than the one before. I'm just saying that the announcement presentation from Jensen is always cherry picked and exaggerates the generational improvement. It happened for Pascal as well. [Here's the proof.](https://youtu.be/yRxoWkSDhVc?t=35)

He says over and over again that the GTX 1080 is 2x the performance of a Titan X (Maxwell). [According to techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-titan-x.c2632) it's only 28% faster. Sounds familiar, right?"
it was about the same. The difference is that the gap could still be high at 1080p and 1440p as the CPU were less of a limiting factor. (If at all)

Aggregate of all those reviews shows 98% faster at 4k"
"on my left i have Slack taking up the right 1/3rd of a monitor and the other 2/3rds is web browser for whatever.

Why would anyone need an entire monitor for discord? Why would you need a full screen video playing while gaming if you're not actually engaged in watching the video.

Meanwhile gaming on an ultrawide is fucking incredible."
"2k is used to describe like 5 different resolutions, I'm technically wrong and you're definitely a douche. You assumed that without asking because you were too busy correcting marketing slang that I had used."
"Great find, thanks!!

I think I’ll add the additional intake fan in any case (it’s a 2000 rpm Noctua) and see from there."
"Jeez haha, that must be some mom's spaghetti code if it gives you trouble with a 3900x. I play mostly flight sim so I'm hoping DCS has nice performance. I want to play it some day."
"Honestly I'm not entirely sure myself because this launch has been such a nightmare, I believe there should be a plain old 3080 XC3 with nothing else in the name that's the mainline model. I don't know the differences between Black and Black Gaming, but I know Black models from EVGA are pretty low end.

I don't know, I'm just as confused as everyone else at this point. I didn't even know there were 2 variants of the XC3 Black."

"I mainly use Computerbase because i like their noise testing the best and their great coverage of all kinds of AIBs (site is german, but charts are easily understandable). Other reviews i skimmed through show similar results."
35% better yes.
"I hope so,but I was thinking the same thing when they released the 2000 series..."
I'm going to sell it once I have a 3080 in hand. Not before just in case I don't get a card
"https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/39.html

Yup"
"true. one thing to check on seeing how mob manf are now. is see how many pci lanes their are on board you want. seeing  that a prem thing now.
for what i do i flood nearly all lanes. with ssd,dual gpus and hdd drives. never have a slow down. but again i design this pc with 4k and 8 workflow ."
Oh shit really? Hmm mine came with windows 10 pre-installed. Since it was part of a pre-built. Am I gonna have to pay for W10 again?
> Will it be compatible with my current MOBO? I looked at the support page and I only see the non-K versions listed in there. I know the list isn't life or death but will it be compatible? I'm running a TUF Gaming B365M plus gaming board rn.
I’ve been playing Control at 24-35 FPS using a 980 Ti FTW.  GSync really saves the day.

"Ah no, I've been spacing it out just because. Waiting for cheaper prices on stuff.. adding a fan here, an RGB strip there. Got a AIO, sent it back because 3600 sees 0 benefits from it, that type of thing :) 

It all started with a RTX2060 upgrade as a placeholder in my old 3570K system, ended with a 1500€ PC, if I get a 3080 tomorrow."
"Well yeah, that's exactly my point. Not many people are going to have the money for all that different stuff for just 1 hobby. 

I have a 65"" C9 OLED from last year that I got for $1700 on Black Friday (the big US shopping day in November)...I'd recommend searching for a deal on that vs the 48"" CX.

Edit: I also had a $2700 65"" C6 that developed a stuck green sub pixel after a little over 2 years (after the warranty expired). Wasn't horrible and a little annoying during dark scenes to have a green sub pixel always shining, but was a good excuse to upgrade to a G-Sync OLED. Point of the story, may be worth it to budget in an extended warranty if you go that route."
"I love my B9 Oled. It’s just as good as any of the X line. It’s bright as all fuck and has the Hdmi 2.1 and Gsync just like the 2020 models do. I’m only buying a 3080 for that tv, because my G 27GL83A-B has a 2070s hooked up to it."
Lovely RTX :)
">Year by year, Boost OC takes the fun away from manual OC.

Yep.

In my mind whatever the card automatically achieves out of the box (in a well cooled installation) is the baseline, which is what the benchmarks we are seeing here reflect. The automatic overclocking featured in this generation of cards seems to already be realizing most of the overclocking potential, so we shouldn't expect to see much further OC unless AIBs offer much higher power limits and much better cooling.

At this point I am interested to see how benchmarks of ASUS/MSI/EVGA's top tier SKUs compare to these FE results, but I think the 3080 isn't a big enough upgrade coming from a 2080ti running +1960mhz core / 8000mhz mem."
You're excused.
"I flashed the bios on my 2080 Ti to go from 114% to 123% power limit or something like that. Never was able to get past +163MHz OC stable regardless of power limit. In the end I settled on 86% power limit for thermals and still could hit +163MHz stable. There was only like +/- 4fps difference in 4K between the lowest and highest power limit, so the actual internal components were the bottle next of the reference board regardless of bios. (Others may have seen bigger gains with a bios flash but just my experience in a warm ITX case)."

"So the answer is... you can't.

I like watching youtube while playing minecraft. It's fun."
Think I saw on either Newegg or best buy. I want a new card but part of me is tempted to just wait a few months until all the dust settles and get stock and info on everything
Why is it that every single time that there is only a single review contradicting the rest it's in German?
Thanks! I appreciate it.
"[You can try reactivating it again.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change)

"I assume we're talking about the single player, because loading online has nothing to do with your personal pc or the speed of your drives."
"Oh I see, I was worried because I’m about to build my first pc and thought maybe it would take forever."
"Dam I paid 1200$ for a 55” B9 and thought that was a good deal. Love it though, and where it is I couldn’t fit bigger than 55” anyway. The tv reviewer Vince made a big fuss over the difference between the B9 and C9, but Rtings and everyone else said it’s basically down to panel variance for any noticeable difference. I also know it’s way brighter than my NU8000 which is supposed to be 800 nits. I’ve even seen one next to a Q90R both on standard, and the B9 looked way brighter. And I had a TCL R617 in 2018 for like 2 weeks before I returned it due to DSE, but hat Tv Was awesome otherwise. The B9 seems just as bright, and that one is 1200 nits. Supposedly twice as bright as the B9, but they looked the same to me as far as brightness. 

Either way it’s amazing, and so was gaming in 1440p 120hz on my 2070s on it. Looking forward to try 4k/120hz after 9:00 AM lol"
"No, I was just asked why one wouldn't buy the 3080, and I answered.  Don't judge me if I don't play casual games at 4k"
"I used to have an ultrawide and I bought a little 13 inch laptop monitor and controller board for it. I put it under my ultrawide and it was my discord monitor and YouTube monitor. I thought about getting another one, but I liked how clean everything was.

Eventually got rid of it cause it was a $600 ultrawide with some compromises and I wanted something higher quality. Spending 1k on a monitor and 1k on a GPU every two years to drive it properly just didn't seem like a reasonable use of my money even though the experience was really good."
I literally described how I do the same thing. Minus the body being full screen. Ultrawide is better.
"I just want to guarantee I have a card for Cyberpunk to be completely honest. I just can't decide if the Founder's edition is the move or gambling on an AIB cooler (In particular the EVGA XC3 Ultra).

The FE looks really compelling this time around but I also have never had to deal with Nvidia customer service and I hear nothing but horror stories. I guess it may not be too bad if I got a Best Buy warranty."
"Dude, its a Video and all Reviews I read said under load its pretty loud."
How do you go about getting a new one if for whatever reason it doesn't reactivate? Do I have to pay a crazy amount?

"The first pc its always expensier, but next time you already have old components to reuse so it ends up being mobo+cpu, gpu or hard drive upgrades from time to time. At least till ddr5 becames the standard and then it would be mobo+cpu+ram instead of the whole pc anyway."
"Depends a lot on where you are, I guess. Europe's been pretty good this year, no massive upmark on anything."
I feel like you're doing something wrong if you're replacing your monitor and video card every year.
"I think what is needed for ultrawides is software that tricks your operating system into thing you have 3 different monitors. Maybe that even already exists.

Because 95% of the time I'm using my computer, I want 3 different monitors. I'd only want the full ultrawide while gaming. And even then, only for games that I'm totally focused on like CS:GO. And even then, most games don't support ultrawide and especially not competitive shooters because it would give you too much of an advantage."
Ya I'll be trying through best buy as well for sure. Don't want to deal with Nvidia directly
"I use a installation repair tool provided by Microsoft to reinstall it, then eventually just search around for cheap product keys. Lots of people will buy a ""business license"" then sell the ~2500 keys associated with that for something like $10 - $20 each."
Yeah apparently that's something they did to make sure people don't abuse faster loading times. It's absolutely ridiculous.
I received the parts just dragging my feet / researching before I start building. I did end up overpaying for some parts just because I didn’t shop around :( but im from US
Shopping around and reading reviews is half the fun!
lol I am doing a bunch of that right now ironically. I will spend way more time on my next build!!
