Any reviews that showed benchmarks for VR games or games running at an ultrawide resolution?,rtx_3080
"People's main complaints seem to be about power consumption and heat, but I've trained. I've lived in the hell of SLI GTX 480s. I'm ready to swap out the 1080 for 3080, this is looking like a worthy upgrade to me for 1440p 144Hz.",rtx_3080
"[Techspot had an interesting theory](https://www.techspot.com/review/2099-geforce-rtx-3080/) about the bottlenecking at lower resolutions may not be entirely CPU based, if you were worried about your CPU not being brand new:

> We've looked deeper at the RTX 3080's performance at 1440p, so we want to comment on that. As far as we can tell, CPU bottlenecking alone is not the explanation. The reason comes down to Ampere's architecture and the change to the SM configuration that we mentioned in the introduction. The 2x FP32 design can only be fully utilized at 4K and beyond. This is because at 4K the portion of the render time per frame is heavier on FP32 shaders. At lower resolutions like 1440p, the vertice and triangle load is identical to what we see at 4K, but at the higher resolution pixel shaders and compute effect shaders are more intensive and take longer and therefore can fill the SMs FP32 ALUs better.",rtx_3080

"From TPU

>Overclocking on ""Ampere"" seems to be identical to ""Turing"". **The cards will sit in their power limit most of the time, also during overclocking.**

>The Founders Edition has a manual power limit adjustment range of up to 370 W, from a default of 320 W. This can help gain a little bit of extra performance, but it's not a night-and-day difference, **maybe 1% real-life performance.**

Power limit is the enemy. If you want to OC these cards, the AIB 3x pins are probably a must. Expect your clocks to jump around everywhere, increasing the power limit slider will reduce these fluctuations.

https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-founders-edition/images/clocks-and-thermals.png

The FE doesn't look like it has good OC headroom. Your best bet is water-cooling for additional boost clocks (about 15Mhz for every 5-8C you can lower the card if we go off of Turing.). 

I'm excited to see what the AIBs with 3 pins can do once they're in our hands.",rtx_3080
any reviews with 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution?  it's at least 15-20% more taxing than regular 1440p from what i hear.,rtx_3080

"Overall, a really great card. Great upgrade if you're still on Pascal.

Coming from a 2080 TI, not sure if I'll upgrade, but the software features are really making me want to. The performance is nice too and roughly what I expected.

EDIT: As some folks below me have mentioned, seems some of the new software features will come to older cards as well so even more reason to stay if you're above a 2060.",rtx_3080

Still trying to decide between FE AND AIB tomorrow",rtx_3080
"I'm still not sure what to do tomorrow. Should I go for a FE or AIB? I know this question has been asked a bunch recently but a lot of the answers were around waiting for benchmarks. Important to note that I'm not too bothered about minuscule upgrades (but if its pretty substantial, then obviously it would make sense). I'm upgrading from a GTX 970 so it's going to be way better regardless",rtx_3080
"Pascalesque upgrade from the RTX 20 series at 4K, but things are a bit mixed for lower resolutions. I thought it was funny how the RTX 3080 was so powerful that it hit the CPU limits in many games at 1440P and below. Truly a beastly 4K card BUT if you're going for very high framerates at 1440P and especially 1080P you should also think about other options like those cheap used 2080Ti or the upcoming 3070 as they could potentially provide better value.",rtx_3080

"Hardware Unboxed has the most sobering review,  though I still think Steve is a little too dismissive of rtx and dlss, and too forgiving of Navi.  He basically calls it a good product with too colorful marketing, and says a large part of any perceived disappointment could be attributed to Digital Foundry and Nvidia,  and not the actual performance itself. 

People really need 4k displays for this card to shine.  Cpus are too slow at the moment and rtx and dlss are only slightly improved.",rtx_3080

Tomorrow is gonna be the big day!",rtx_3080
"As expected, very good gains, just not as good as the slides made people believe, this is very similar to Pascal against Maxwell - ""1070 faster than Titan X"" - yes, right, in a few titles with some details at some resolutions.

It's an amazing GPU nonetheless.

Kudos for the Founder Edition, amazing performance considering the 300W+ power consumption.",rtx_3080
"Coming from a 1080 that isn't making it for ultrawide 100+hz, I'll be going 3080 for sure. However I will not be going FE, I'll be going MSI or Asus like I always do. I'm all about noise reduction and they typically have the best db vs. performance ratios.",rtx_3080
"Hey guys, I have a 1080ti and am looking to upgrade alongside ryzen 4 when it drops. 

I have enough saved to get a 3090 (at the proposed price) but I'm beginning to feel more and more that a 3080 will be enough.

Especially as it will be purely be for gaming and not streaming or rendering. 

Am i right that the difference for me likely wont be worth the extra money or are we still a bit in the dark about it?",rtx_3080
"So if we want to OC and Watercool, don't go FE is what I'm hearing?",rtx_3080
"Great benchmark scores.

It's all down to whether Nvidia have enforced a hard power limit on the AIB partners.

There's barely any headroom on the FE for overclocking. If it's the same on the AIBs, then those 3x8 pin models are absurd as they'll offer no benefit at all.",rtx_3080
"Now we probably know why they priced these cards so aggressively. I think the AMD cards are going to be very competitive. I mean, the price is amazing, putting 2080Ti to shame, but if you have a 2080Ti, I see no reason to sell it for a 3080. 

900 and 1000 series owners will probably buy it though, but I think they should wait to see AMD performance, before buying.",rtx_3080
"So 3600 and 3080 should definitely be fine with a decent 600W PSU, right? Probably gonna avoid overclocking ofc.",rtx_3080

"I know this is going to sound salty and I know influencers getting cards early is not even a drop in the supply bucket but its super irritating that so many shit tier youtubers get these cards in advance while half of us probably wont be able to grab one for months due to ""supply shortages"".

TechPowerUp's review states that undervolting isnt possible! IS this because Afterburner hasnt been updated or is it locked off entirely? Would the AIB cards be able to be undervolted?,rtx_3080
"I can't find a single video that actually goes into the fan noise and how loud the card is and compared to other cards that are actually in depth.  One of my greatest issues is fan noise, I can't hear my EVGA 1080 ti sc2 at full load at all.

I can't find a video of the card at full load so I can hear it, I can't find much information at all and there isn't much about how it affects cpu temps but what I can find it doesn't affect more than a few degrees.

Does anyone know where there is some decent info on noise?  I was hoping Gamer Nexus would have more, he even got straight into it first thing but I was underwhelmed by lack of info although he will probably post another video at a later date.",rtx_3080

Did anyone mention what kind of fan bearings the 3080 FE uses?,rtx_3080
"Pretty underwhelming IMO.  Way better deal for those in the market now than I was when I got back into desktop PCs. Reviews generally nailed it:  worthwhile cards.  Since I am pleased enough with where I am at I will hold out for the next gen, hopefully on a TSMC process(or whoever the fab-master is at that time).  Its not enough of an upgrade for my 1440p uses to justify the cash outlay or the hassle of draining the loop even.",rtx_3080
"The 1440p benchmarks bode well for me, coming from a 1080 Ti. Wouldn't upgrade from anything above a 2080 if that was my case, simply because of how much money I would lose. 

I don't expect the 3070 to be truly better than the 2080 Ti in anything besides full raytraced games like Minecraft.",rtx_3080
" I have to say, I'm surprised to hear bitwit recommend that a 550W PSU may be enough for this card. Granted, the power draw in his review was below 550W, but many users will have additional peripherals plugged into their systems; HDDs, SSDs, keyboard, mouse, etc. and that will likely put you beyond the capabilities of a 550W PSU. I'd recommend at least a 650W unit, but 750W is probably the better choice to provide a safe amount of headroom.",rtx_3080

"Overall I'm still pretty impressed with the performance. A little disappointing to me that so many reviewers/consumers (especially LTT and they had to add a *disclaimer in the video) are stuck on ""2x the performance of the 2080!"" when in reality it was ""UP TO 2x the performance of the 2080"" and with a little common sense with how companies like to advertise products means in very very specific scenarios will you actually see a 100% performance increase. I feel the circle of people I just described are the same people that get baited in by all the ""Interest rate AS LOW AS ___%"" and get mad when they dont qualify for the rock bottom rate with a credit score in the 500s

Regardless I'm pleased! Especially with the fan noise/temps. I'm sure it'll be even better in an actual tower with optimized airflow vs an open bench where hopefully the design to have ~50% of the hot air pushed out the back vs 100% into the case is more apparent.

"I don't all watch videos and read articles. Watched GN (the methodology guy), HU (the game benchmark guy), DF (the Crisis guy, but see below), Paul (the decent and wise guy), and Kyle (love the fact that he used 3600XT), Dave Lee (showing his Ghost build and failure to run with 600W PSU with 10900K) then also go through the Guru 3D (recommending 650 W PSU) and TechPowerUp (undervolt/overclock explanations).


But I really like Digital Foundry reviews overall, every minutes of Richard explanations were really useful, he also tries to give the big picture (type of games according to the extent of improvement) and scenario to scenario analysis (what is limiting the performance, and if you have Turing or Pascal at the moment). I agree with their statement when they mention ""Brute Force Power"".


My take away:
I am OK with the RTX3080 performance (so, still impressive, esp. that 4K performance) and definitely offers a lot of value now buying GPU at 700USD range for the performance it can offer especially considering how crazy it was with the high end of the the RTX20-series but at the same time I am disappointed about the power figures (performance/watt). After checking further, sadly there is no way to undervolt RTX3080 (TechPowerUp). Probably this is the best way to upgrade if you are with Pascal card now and having the budget and headroom (thermal, power), but even more conditional if you are with Turing now.",rtx_3080

"In summary, it's good.",rtx_3080
"Looks very impressive over all.

The review by Linus was the first time I heard about this miscommunication concerning SR-IOV and, being someone who'd benefit from that on consumer cards, it was a bit of a rollercoaster between getting excited and crashing down back to reality once it truned out that this was in fact just a misunderstanding.

I know that it is very unlikely, especially considering the number of people who'd benefit from SR-IOV support is tiny, though I'd still love to see Nvidia enable this funcitionality for regular users. Even just a limited, highly restricted implementation to not canibalize Quadro/Tesla sales would be appreciated.

They could go so far as to lock this down to only being able to ""split"" the GPU once, the ability to continue running the host system without the need to stop the display manager while using a guest would be greatly appreciated by those who, due to space constraints (ITX builds, rack mounted servers with limited PCIe slotes) and because their CPU has no graphics unit included are currently unable to passthrough their GPU without disabling the display manager.

I get that this is very unlikely, almost impossible, but one can always hope.",rtx_3080

AMD is going to come out and may get close to 3080 but likely with much less power draw. 

If that is the case then 2080Ti owners might be better off going AMD This gen (sin for team green for lifers like me I know I know) OR waiting for the NVDA response.

And believe me NVDA will have a response. Did we get Tis yet? Nope. Supers? Nope.

Any info on performance improvement from 2080 Super to 3080?,rtx_3080
[deleted],rtx_3080
"Nice performance upgrade, but like [computerbase.de](https://computerbase.de) showed, it's about the same compared between Maxwell and Pascal. Really good but that's how it should be. In my opinion the $699 for the 3080 is fair, but the $499 for the upcoming 3070 is too expensive. It's the same like RTX 2070 and that was alredy too much. I'm aware we talking about RTX cards with additional Tensor and RT cores, but that should be a point for the first gen (early adopters), but not anymore on the second one. It's called technical progress and even new consoles/RNDA2 getting dedicated Raytracing hardware (although it seems not on the level of Nvidia) show it's slowly becoming mainstream.

Last generations had the x70 normally at $349-$399 price range and another ""bad aftertaste"" is it having 8GB VRAM (and normal GDDR6). That means 8GB for the third time and this can quickly become more of a bottleneck for 4K than the raw GPU power of the card (now knowing the performance of the 3080 we can estimate this fairly well). 

IMO 3080 should have 12GB and 3070 at least 10GB and also GDDR6X. Most people keep their GPU for about 4 years and I already see Triple AAA titles at 2021 or 2022 at the latest (when multi platform PS5/XSX/PC games will start rising) saturating 8GB VRAM. DLSS helps, but you will also most likely want to use RTX at the same time so this will negate each other in terms of VRAM usage. 

Will wait for the 3070Ti, but if it really will have 16GB this could also mean a fairly huge surcharge and I'm not willing to pay around $600 for roughly 3070 performance with just more VRAM. A 3070Ti with 12GB VRAM could be the best compromise. Let's say they will release it in Q1/2021, then dropping the price of the normal 3070 to $399 and selling the 3070Ti for $499. Could happen, but will very much depend on demand and how Big Navi will perform.",rtx_3080
"I was pretty set on this but debating more and more about just waiting and going for a 3070.

* upgrading from a 1070. have a ryzen 3700x.
* running 1440p 144hz as well as 4k/60 TV sometimes, also have a Rift S I dont use enough but still care about running well
* most excited about RTX tbh. The generational leap of 2x + performance as well. less concerned over an extra 20%
* have a Nano S ITX case, not super worried about either card as its big for an ITX case. but not overloading it too much is appealing
* have a 650W PSU currently. Im unsure if it will be sufficient for the 3080 even though it seems like it might be, at least know it will work for a 3070
* i can afford the extra $200 if it makes sense too, i dont like throwing money away of course but it did seem reasonable to me for the upgrade.
* the month wait stinks a bit for the 3070, but if im honest with myself i dont have a huge immediate need to upgrade. waiting at least gives more time for reviews, and i should still get a card before Cyberpunk in November either way",rtx_3080

"Coffin already ordered for Ampere, no chance for Nvidia, borderline lying as always and producing space heaters. I also laughed hard at the first RTX 3080 prices in my country, the cheapest model is 1100 EUR, nice.

All bow to the Ampere undertaker, the greatest graphics accelerator architecture on planet Earth, **RDNA2**... Ampere is destined to melt both literally and figuratively, RTX 3080 is losing in hashrate to the ancient father RX 5700, the foundation card for the greatest upcoming accelerator.

"2080ti owner here.  Honestly -- a little bit let down.  

Don't get me wrong, I think 3000 series is doing an amazing job at bringing high end performance at a more affordable price. It's legitimately great from that perspective. 

My disappointment stems from the fact that I don't feel like there was a huge jump in performance from a 2080ti.  25% is nothing to sneeze at, but it's also not blowing my socks off either. 

We still have the 3090, but I feel like we're paying for VRAM we won't need to realistically use in gaming until the 3090 is already outdated :P.",rtx_3080
" What I'm seeing is that Nvidia massively cherry picked their performance benchmarks and that these are not nearly as great as they seemed.

"(2080 Ti here)

I’m still half and half about tomorrow morning. In some respects, it would really bring a nice bump to my general 4K performance but it’s not pascal levels of “OMG!” in games that I’m playing and plan to be playing.

Also I’ve seen practically no RTX 4K back to back tests with a 2080 Ti (only 1440p tests) which tells me this card still isn’t the killer 4K RTX @ 60 in newer titles that I’ve been waiting for. The 3090 looks like a solid bet but it also may even be a touch overkill.

So I guess I’m leaning away from it now but I’ll definitely be interested to see some of the refreshes next year or even next gen in the following year where Nvidia’s apparently planning to use a much more efficient multi-chip implementation than in previous gens (690) for their next architecture. So yeah, probably one less buyer to compete with!",rtx_3080
"I decided to not be a day-1 buyer based on the reviews.

I currently have a 1080 (non-Ti). There's no question that the 3080 is much, much faster. It's basically double the performance of the 1080.

What I didn't expect fully was that the 3080 basically sits on its 320W power limit all the time. It's not quite double the power consumption of the 1080, but going from 180W to 320W is a big jump.

It's not that the 3080 is a bad card, it's just that NVIDIA's ""performance per watt"" claims don't seem to be relevant to the actual cards. The 3080 is slightly better than 2080, which was slightly better than the 1080.

The 3070 might be better here, but honestly I think I'm going to wait for the RDNA2 reviews. If AMD can really deliver on a 50% performance/watt uplift over the RX 5700XT like they have claimed, they'll be ahead of the RTX 3080. 

I'm a bit skeptical that AMD can actually deliver, but at this point I'm just not blown away by the 3080. If you are in the ""I don't care about heat/power"" crowd, and if you can actually get your hands on a board, you'll probably love the RTX 3080.",rtx_3080

I would only consider it if there were an over whelming number of DX12 and Ray tracing games available but there just aren't yet so more than likely skipping this gen. I play on a 1440p 240hz monitor, the 3080 might make sense for someone gaming at 4k who loves eye candy so they can guarantee a solid 4k60hz experience. I am interested in seeing what AMD releases as well. Good time to get into PC gaming for sure.",rtx_3080

"I was actually hoping to purchase a 3080 and see major 1440p improvements from the 2080. But seeing this now, performance differences might not be worth a whole new purchase after all. Although im excited to see what AMD is going for. 

RDR2 I run above 60fps with most graphic settings on high/ultra. Every other game runs fine as well too. Im not getting triple digit FPS but I also only play Halo3 and R6 Siege competitive so there isn't much improvement there, along with some Squad shenanigans and even then I get a minimum of 90fps at max settings.  

Overall I dont see myself buying it any time soon, I dont see a need in FPS boost nor am I struggling to play anything on 1440p 144hz. MFS2020 is a bit of a struggle but I dont play often.

"Jay and Linus both mention it.

TL;DW:
Previous cards have always heated up the temps of the CPU and RAM, so does the 3080 FE, but its turning out that its heating them less than previous cards due to a slicker airflow. (Not by a significant amount)

Basically, CPU/RAM temp increases from this FE are null.",rtx_3080
"I didn't post [the results](https://babeltechreviews.com/rtx-3080-arrives-ampere-performance-revealed-35-games-benchmarked/view-all/), but there was no effect (I could determine) on the CPU temp in a very well cooled Phanteks Eclipse P400 ATX mid-tower (plus 1 Noctua 140mm fan).

All my benchmarking and overclocking performed with the case closed and the i9-10900K at 5.0/5.1GHz temps didn't rise above what is usual.",rtx_3080

"Looking for this information as well and turning up little to nothing. I guess most reviewers just had it on a test bench or use AIO which are much more popular now. The linus example doesn't give any useful context so its not a reliable source.

I want to use HDMI 2.1 on my LG C9. 4k 120hz HDR 10 bit without chroma subsampling is one of the main reasons for me to upgrade from my 2080Ti to a 3080. The performance increase alone wouldn't make it worth it for me.,rtx_3080

"This plus the one review that stated that they heard some coil whine is pushing me towards an AIB. Looks like for sure the power limit will define your overall OC ability, so unless you get a unit that runs well undervolted your headroom is pretty limited. You're stuck with the power limit with FE, no way around that. People that don't OC won't care about that though.",rtx_3080
why did they only push the fan to 54%?,rtx_3080

"Good review but he seems eager to display the card in a bad light. I'm neither an Nvidia nor AMD fanboy, and I've had GPUs from both within the last year. There's something off about this guy to me. I don't know...",rtx_3080
"Yeah, this is what I need. Right now Im just assuming that the 3090 is going to be a better fit with double the Vram.",rtx_3080
"I couldn't find anything either.  Sort of crazy, as 3080 will probably really shine compared to previous generations in VR benches.  On a valve index 2x super sampling is roughly equivalent to a 6k display, with 130% more pixels.",rtx_3080

"that's fair, but the fact that this is even a thing is the problem... obviously, ""some companies"" knew this was going to be VERY limited in quantity which is why such scripts are ran out of necessity.

release the product when you have enough to stave off scalpers; otherwise, it's simply as good as a proof of concept for the majority of us.",rtx_3080
Definitely go for the 3070! It’s going to be a huge upgrade for you and at 1080p you won’t see any big gain from getting a 3080.,rtx_3080
"Wait for the 3070 or even 3060, unless you have some high refresh monitor you’ll be wasting money getting a 3080 tbh

3080 is for 4K or 1440p 144Hz, save that extra $200 by waiting for a 3070 then use those savings to upgrade your monitor",rtx_3080
"Unless you've got like a 240hz+ 1080p eSports monitor, the 3070 should be more than enough for you. Almost every game reviewed at 1080p with max graphics settings were CPU limited.",rtx_3080
From my understanding 3080 would be overkill for 1080p not that you shouldn't get it if you wanted too but the question is if you would want to spend $200 extra versus a 3070 that should be perfect for 1080p,rtx_3080
"I mean, get a new monitor. That's really the important thing.",rtx_3080
I think it really depends on the CPU,rtx_3080
Not quite right. IgorsLab has measured peaks and he recommends 750W to not get limited.,rtx_3080

"I will admit I skimmed a lot of these reviews, but did it say somewhere that 650W would be fine?

If you were getting an AIB board with 3 x 8 pin connectors and your PSU didn't have 3 gpu support (3 separate 8 pin outputs) then you may have had to upgrade any ways.,rtx_3080
“ONLY” like 30% isn’t a good jump specially if u just want stable 4K,rtx_3080

First mistake is comparing a 3080 to a 2080ti. The 3080 is base version just as a 2080 is base version. ti is different.,rtx_3080
"I have a 2080, the software features were definitely pushing me to along with “double performance”, but after reviews I think I can wait a year.

"This is the really funny part of all these 2080ti memes. People are giving y'all shit but the card is still incredibly powerful and will be plenty for the majority of upcoming games. Percentages always have a wow-factor to them, but it's funny how people quiet down once they understand what that means in terms of true in-game FPS. All of a sudden that nutty 25% increase translates into only like 15-20fps in higher-end titles and spending hundreds of dollars doesn't seem so sexy anymore lmao.",rtx_3080
"My rule of thumb is only upgrade if it's 75% minimum better in something meaningful. Even at 4K you're only looking at 30%. You'll barely feel that. Maybe if you got a great price for your 2080 ti so it's basically a free upgrade, but otherwise wait until the next gen.",rtx_3080
"i think the only reason you wouldnt upgrade from a 2080 ti is simply bc of what you spent.

if you spent the normal amount im pretty sure we wouldnt have this discussion. going from a 2080 ti to a 3080 seems reasonable to me in terms of performance gains.",rtx_3080
"As a 2060s owner I’m right on the edge of wanting to upgrade, but not needing to immediately. I’ll ride the 2nd wave of availability if my 8700k struggles with Watchdogs Legion at 1080p with RTX/DLSS on",rtx_3080
I'm actually considering biting the bullet and springing for the 3090 instead. Metro Exodus was a bummer to run on a 2080 at 4k. 3080 only bumps you to 70fps with RTX off. I *really* want a tits out experience for cyberpunk.,rtx_3080
"GTX 1080 at 1440p / 144 Hz.

I never really was looking at the 3080, only the 3070. I'm concerned that the 3070 will actually be a big enough jump to justify moving to at this point.",rtx_3080
"Going from a 2080ti to 3080 for \~$250 is definitely not bad. Maybe not if you only count performance, but you get extra features and a fresh warrenty.",rtx_3080

"To a massively lesser degree, evga's ftw version appears to have some through holes to reduse recirc, so they're trying.",rtx_3080

"honestly i wouldnt expect a big difference. people are forgetting nvidia did not use reference design here. for all intents and purposes the FE is an AIB.

youre going to have to probably spend a good $100-200 to see any real diff if overclocking.

could be wrong, but we're talking about a non reference design and new unique style cooler nvidia is using. i just dont see why 90% of AIB would be any better.",rtx_3080
"The super-abridged summary:

It's good; AIB's could have an edge in OC certain situations, which honestly isn't different than any other generation.",rtx_3080
"Sorry for being ignorant but FE is founders edition, right? what is AIB",rtx_3080
"That’s where I am at..

Although, the only AIB I think worth getting that is actually releasing is the MSI gaming x trio. EVGA ftw and Asus strix aren’t even releasing tomorrow.",rtx_3080
Are the AIB reviews still restricted? I'm not seeing them anywhere.,rtx_3080
"FE board appears to have basically no overhead for OC, thanks to the power limits baked into BIOS.

Some of the AiBs may have more overhead, but we won't know which until they get reviewed.",rtx_3080
"FE if you dont OC, AiB if you want to OC",rtx_3080
"If you're the type of person to go for as much force out of a GPU as you can get go AIB. If you're fine with crushing everything with stock speeds you dont need an AIB, unless of course FE sells out.",rtx_3080
"FE for sure. AIB cards tend to be more expensive and the lower tier cards are the worst binned cards.

FE cards tend to be cherry picked by nvidia and binned well.

So for AIB your paying more for a worse binned card with the hope that the cooler design makes up for it. And for lower tier AIB cards I don’t think the coolers will be up to par.

Only makes sense if you’re gonna get a top of the line AIB, but then it’s gonna cost $850 ish or more and at that point the extra performance you may get isn’t even worth the extra $.",rtx_3080
Agreed. A 3070 would probably be better value for 1440 and below.,rtx_3080

"Same. Don't even have a 4K monitor so I feel like that jump from a 2070 Super to a 3080 JUST for 1440p is kind of a waste. That isn't to say it's a bad card by any means. I think if you're rocking like a 1060, this is it. Think the performance for the price point is a game changer. But for me personally and with what I got already? idk.

"I think if you have a 1080Ti, it might still work well enough with Ryzen 4000. Perhaps in 6 months 3080Ti will drop with price and performance somewhere in between 3080 and 3090.",rtx_3080
yep.,rtx_3080
There's no reason to assume anything about AMD other than hope.,rtx_3080
Pretty much yea.,rtx_3080
Psu is way too weak.,rtx_3080
"This is hard to explain, but Nvidia tried with their graph. Power-Consumption-To-Performance is not linear. If you set the 2080TI and the 3080 to the same FPS in a particular game, there would be a maximum of 1.9x more power being used for the 2080ti to make the same FPS.

&#x200B;

In a scenario where the 3080 used exactly 50% more power for 50% more FPS would be indicative of a relatively large increase in efficiency, actually. Take CPUs for example, the i7 10700 non-k will hold around 3.9 ghz all 8 cores when limited to its 65w power target, but will boost up to 4.8 and pull up to 330w sustained. That's a frequency increase of 23% and a power consumption increase of 507%?

&#x200B;

Also, the 2080ti had bios that would allow the default 250 watt target to pull around 350 watts, and the FPS increase with those OCs was no where near 50%, like the power consumption was.

&#x200B;

This is what Nvidia was saying.",rtx_3080
Watch Gamers Nexus part on Power/Performance. It's more efficient.,rtx_3080
Ehmm it is.,rtx_3080
"My main concern too. I like how Digital Foundry mentions about ""Brute Force"". The performance seems impressive, nice, yes, but at huge extra costs of power.

I am personally curious like why it seems more difficult like to gain more perf/watt improvement in GPU technically than in CPU (relatively speaking)? Is it just NVidia architecture/design already at the max edge of the perf/watt or is there any other reason? just super curious if anyone outside like us can have an educated guess/analysis.",rtx_3080
">This looks impressive but it's definitely not the card it was touted out to be. The power consumption is pretty disappointing. I have faith in AMD.

Yeah what was the touted perf/watt increase? Looks like it's what.. 50% perf/watt gain best case scenario? Other scenarios, much less? Like 15-20%?  Worst case, it's a regression?

Uses 50% more power than a FE 2080ti for not 50% more fps?",rtx_3080
Are you running a data center full of these?  Why do you care so much about power consumption?,rtx_3080
"NVIDIA Engineer probably: ""I bought a 750W PSU so I'm gonna USE my 750 watts""",rtx_3080
It's worth mentioning that there is a large enough population of those of us in PC gaming with cheap power that we don't really even consider power consumption relevant.,rtx_3080
"It's exactly what they touted it to be. ""Up to"" X in performance, which it does do sometimes. It's twice as efficient in power, at power levels the old cards used...but it goes much higher for much higher performance and doesn't scale well in that.",rtx_3080
"> AMD, please deliver.

Considering the 3080 is only sucking 50W more than the 5700XT yet is 100% (2x) as fast - doubt.

AMD is claiming they're getting about a 60% improvement per watt with RDNA2. A bit of simple math shows us RDNA2 just isn't as efficient as Ampere, so either AMD will have to ramp power draw way up, or accept lower performance.

Leaks are putting Big Navi between the 3070 and 3080, but closer to the 3070. That makes sense with what we're seeing.",rtx_3080
"awe thats cute, they care about the little guy",rtx_3080
You have to remember that a lot of these guys have to return the cards and they are just review samples.,rtx_3080
Is the FE cooler good in temps or noise?  I want the quietest 3080 but have no idea without sub reviews whether that's going to be FE or AIB.,rtx_3080
You may want to go with AIBs due to better power delivery. Seems like FE is limited in power.,rtx_3080
It's not really cpu bottlenecks as much as ampere's architecture being geared towards higher resolutions and bandwidth. 1440p results seem disappointing across the board. Maybe in newer games we'll see those gaps increase again as the newer engines become more demanding,rtx_3080
"These extra FP32 units in 3080 allow for faster pixel shading, however, at 1440p (2K) the pixel shading time fraction of the frame is ~2.3 times smaller than that of 2160p (4K). That's why the improvement at 1440p isn't as great as that at 2160p. 

That smaller improvement at 1440p isn't caused by CPU bottleneck.",rtx_3080
what about DLSS at 1440p from 1080p I guess ? Would this be caught in the 1080p bottleneck ? And 4k DSR on 1440p ?,rtx_3080
"What? Small increase in 1440p is the problem that was not expected vs ocd 2080tis.in 4k its a nice jump, but most peolle game at 1440p or 1080p. People where saying 30procent plus performance jump... In 1440p its between 7 and 15procent. 
 
This card is an insane jump for people still on the 1000series or lower 2000series card.",rtx_3080
That’s ok. More for me. Coming from a 1080ti,rtx_3080
The cards are impressive at 4k but 1440p performance is 30% better than the 2080ti. Hardly any reason to upgrade if you're on a top end Turing card,rtx_3080
"Shhh let it happen, man. More stock for us lol",rtx_3080
"Honestly a fair number of those are probably people a little sour that they massively overpaid for the 2080 Ti. It was not a great card in price-performance ratio, and we've got something 20% - 30% faster at \~60% of the price.",rtx_3080
Next week according to Ryan,rtx_3080
Which review you are getting that? Hardware Unboxed absolutely no significant difference between 10900k and 3950x.,rtx_3080
Um no. The claim was that the 3070 will be the same as the 2080 ti not the 3080.,rtx_3080
"Your wrong.. They said the 3070would provide the same performsnce as the 2080ti. 
The 3080 vs a ocd 2080ti in 1440p isnt much faster..anywhere between 7 and 15procent it seems. In 4k its a nice 20procent+
 
Thats the problem with stating a percentage without resolution. Its not the same over the whole board.
 
Thats why peolle are wondering how the 3070is going to live up to that statement.",rtx_3080
They said that about the 3070 not 3080,rtx_3080
Just.. never listen to reddit. It's really simple. People on this site are fucking stupid.,rtx_3080
"Nvidia claimed the 3070 would be 2080 Ti levels. Now we are seeing the 3080 barely outdo the 2080 Ti by no more than 10% at BEST. Meaning the 3070 will fall behind the 2080 Ti by a significant margin. 

So Ampere is kind of a disappointment.",rtx_3080

"You can't look at temps alone these days. Most of these cards push as hard as they can up to the temperature or power limit with Boost clocks.

The new cooler is a lot better because it's dissipating a lot more heat since the card is using more power and the temps aren't too much higher.",rtx_3080
The other pinned post has useful pictures showing you the measurements,rtx_3080
"Im curous about this aswell! Usually AIBs have superiour temp and noise, but now Im not so sure.",rtx_3080
"The temp of the card is controlled by how efficient the heatsink is in taking the heat energy generated by the card and dumping it into your room. The better it is at dumping the heat into your room (either directly or via the case), the lower the card temps.

You eventually reach an equilibrium where your pc is at a constant temp which means that heat generated by components = heat into your room.

One way to think about this is increasing the fan speed on a card. If you increase the fan speed (or add more fans like the FTW3), you decrease the card temps. Where did that energy go? Into your room heating it up.

Basically, the AIBs will likely have cooler/quieter cards but the energy generated by them will be the same or greater.",rtx_3080

For people playing in lower resolutions I don't know why they're looking to spend so much money on video cards anyway, especially those not pairing it with a super high refresh monitor. 1080p/60 just doesn't call for this kind of card.    
     
For us using 4k, though? It's ~50% or more boost from a 2080 to the 3080. That's absolutely enormous, and unless someone really just isn't playing anything that'd use the power (and why would they be hyping the card anyway then?) I don't see why it wouldn't be seen as a must buy. If VR is a factor, then it becomes even more desirable.    
    
For 2080ti owners it might be small enough to not want to upgrade...but it's still a decent upgrade. On the other hand, if I was willing to spend $1200 for a 2080ti last time then I'd probably be looking more at the 3090 anyway.",rtx_3080

It's really noticable when playing VR because it demands so much more from the CPU, not to mention that many games are in fact CPU bound. If I were you I'd be looking at a CPU upgrade first. Perhaps look at used 2080 / 2070 supers?",rtx_3080

You are delusional. And the 150$ is for the 3090.,rtx_3080
"For its size it probably will be the best cooler, but the FE is a 2 slot card and it's going to be very difficult to compete with a 2.7 slot AIB card that simply has a bigger heatsink and 3 fans.",rtx_3080
"But it also has power limitation issues, meaning 0% chance of overclocking",rtx_3080
"Nah, the FE cooler will probably wreak havoc on the airflow of small cases, especially sandwich models.",rtx_3080
That $150 is just a stupid rumour. A heat sink and 2 $3 fans wont cost $150.,rtx_3080
Same. I'll be scrambling for one tomorrow,rtx_3080
"Same re the HDMI 2.1/variable refresh compatibility, albeit going for a 3090 as I'd like to get as close to being able to do 4k/120hz as possible (although I suspect the 3090 will still be a way off, but does have the option of adding a second card via NV Link at a later date at least).",rtx_3080

Yep any RTX card,rtx_3080

I'll be waiting to see what AMD has to offer and benchmarks in Cyberpunk. That'll be the deciding factor for me for sure.",rtx_3080
What extra features? I guess there is nothing that the 3000s can do the 2000s can't do. Not a worth it upgrade(specially if you have 2080ti) at all unless you're rich and you don't care about it.,rtx_3080
"Have to look at this way -  selling a item for 60+% depreciation and paying another 40%+ over your sell price for 30% better performance at 4k is a terrible idea.Also lets be frank, majority of 2080ti users are at 1440p...most are not rocking 4k high res gaming panels. 

so in end, if you miss your chance to sell 2080ti before crash...no point to spend extra to continue playing 1440p when 2080ti performance was already good at 1440p anyway.",rtx_3080
"I wouldn't bother, but with a 2070S, I'm probably going to get a 3080. Should be a large increase.",rtx_3080
"Willing to wager that vast majority of 2080ti owners are not rocking 4k high refresh panels. So after missing the the chance to sell before 2080ti price cash, makes no sense to pay more from now sale price to continue playing at 1440p resolution.

Until we get cheaper 4k high end monitors, makes no sense for 2080ti folks to sell now.Might as well continue gaming at 1440p till new better monitors more readily available. 

Anyway, I am hoping to score a 2080ti for 400 orless if can lol.",rtx_3080
How much performance difference do you think will happen with said cards?,rtx_3080
So just to clarify - do you believe they will have superior performance without overclocking?,rtx_3080
? What I read was the FE had quite a bit more power than reference chips. And most the good AIB seem to cost an extra $200+,rtx_3080
"I know not everyone is willing to do this but I just wanted to point out that you will probably be able flash your vBIOS to unlock higher power limits on the FE. The new 12-pin connector is capable of delivering up to 600W (someone please fact check me on this), so with a different vBIOS in theory you would be able to push the FE pretty hard. The FE is $100 cheaper and has already been proven to have a very capable cooler, so just  keep that in mind before you are spending your money on a very pricey AIB model (for example where I live in Canada the MSI Gaming Trio is going for $1200 CAD which equates to about $910 USD, which is a hefty price increase over the $700 FE), you may be able to get similar performance/thermals with the FE assuming you can find an appropriate vBIOS.",rtx_3080
"Shame. In my country FE cards are pretty much unobtainable, it's all 3rd party AIBs.

I just love the reference design so much this gen.",rtx_3080
"I want a blower card, though (but that'd be an insane setup given the over 300W it's drawing). Or at least a basic flat two-slot tri-fan that isn't ""GAMERRRRRRRRRR"" shit. Founders is a great compromise, but will be gone in 60 seconds.

Guess I'll have to print one myself.",rtx_3080
So you don't believe they will have a performance edge outside overclocking? I am asking because i am leaning towards FE (i never oc anyway) but i don't wanna miss out on non-oc performance.,rtx_3080
What do you think about noise? 42dB while gaming seems good. Do you think there will be some 35dB AIBs?,rtx_3080
"Add in board. It’s refers to 3rd party cards (EVGA, MSI, ASUS, etc)",rtx_3080
"Add In Board.

I don't plan on overclocking. Ty for the help!,rtx_3080
"Awesome sounds good, I'll be looking for the FE tomorrow then so hopefully I'll get one before it sells out. Thanks a bunch",rtx_3080
Interesting point. How do you think AIB noise levels will compare to FE?,rtx_3080
Happy cake day sir,rtx_3080
but will the 3070 be able to last at least 4-6 years with those 144hz 1440p games?,rtx_3080
"Digital Foundry's video would probably show you what you need then. They compared it to the 1080 in alot of their benchmarks and showed a 2.5x increase or more in alot of games. [Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7FlXu9dAMU).

However for the 1080P part, it seems the majority of reviews are focused on 4K and 1440P, as there are big CPU bottlenecks at lower resolutions preventing the card from stretching its legs.

But yeah it will still hit those fps targets obviously, in fact i'd say it would be an actual ""future-proof"" card for 1080P for a long time, if you're interested in that.",rtx_3080
"It never even said anything for nvidia on mine. Best Buy went from coming soon to sold out immediately, never had an opportunity",rtx_3080

"It's about 50% over the 2080 (Hardware Unboxed 14-game average was 47% if I remember right), so it'd be an even bigger upgrade over the 2070.     
     
The only way that's not a big enough upgrade is if I were shopping for hype and not performance gains. I think expecting more than that was a little crazy, no matter what Nvidia said.",rtx_3080
"Igor's lab shows my 5700 XT at 65% in 1440p.. which is slightly worse than a 2070 Super.

So it's really not that much of a jump as Nvidia advertised.",rtx_3080
Exactly my opinions. I'll wait for the next cards/super or TI editions and then re-evaluate.,rtx_3080
Biggest issue is that it seem be bottlenecked by architecture at 1440p too. So seems a bit like a waste.,rtx_3080
I have a 3440 x 1440 monitor and a 2070S and I'm considering it. It's just on the border. But I think we'll be fine if we keep our cards another generation. Or wait for ti.,rtx_3080
"You have spoken to me. I will be upgrading from my 1060.

But im hearing rumors that a 3080 ti will come out the end of this yeear",rtx_3080
"Prices here in Singapore are a little bit higher as compared to the US and the founders edition costs 810USD. I have a 1440p 144hz with gsync and the 2070 super is doing just fine for now. What really intrigued me about the 3080 was the claim that it was 2x as fast as a 2080, but that was rarely the case in 1440p. HUGE improvements were only seen in 4K and I don't plan to change my LG 27GL850 anytime soon. But hey, to each their own, some may want their games to be running at 144hz constantly but as I have gsync, this isn't really an issue for me.",rtx_3080
Impressive. But not justifiable enough for me. Others may feel differently but this is just my opinion.,rtx_3080

Even if you mean a stock card that’s not oc’d I doubt that’s the case.

Then if you compare a properly oc’d stock vs whatever you have I doubt the difference is much.",rtx_3080
"2070 super is still a decent card, so it just depends- are you trying to run ultrawide 3440x1440 at 144hz, or 4k at 60+?  Then yes, probably worth upgrading.  Are you running 1440 standard screen, or 1080p? I'd wait a bit, or maybe upgrade the monitor first.",rtx_3080
2070 Super is basically a 1080Ti in terms of performance so still a good upgrade,rtx_3080
60-90% better at 4K in most title according to Jayz 2 cents  and Gamers Nexus,rtx_3080
"If you don't know (other than there being no benchmarks yet), then you don't ~~want~~ need a 3090.

Also there will be a 3080 Ti/Super/whatever.",rtx_3080
Im coming from a 980ti and I use it for VR and Im having a hard time justifying a 3090.,rtx_3080
"Not op but tyvm for this video, I play Apex at UW1440p on a 2070S and get about 70-90fps in game..will be great to hover around the 144 mark!",rtx_3080
"Same, but I am upgrading from a 980",rtx_3080
There are a few tests that specifically show that it does not raise any cpu temps due to this exact reason.,rtx_3080
"i wish there was a place where I could compare how much more it will take vs my 1060, and how much it will cost per month",rtx_3080
"3090 is expected to be another 15-25% performance on 3080 *but* at over 100% price increase. It seems like a way better idea to grab a 3080 and upgrade again in a shorter period (or use the money elsewhere in PC or life).

I went into the announcement expecting to pre order a £1400 GPU and came out wanting to buy the £650-750 instead.",rtx_3080
"Only that the consoles are based on rdna 2,and from what we know about the consoles, they are at the 2080 level,from what digital foundry said.

Let's see, I don't think amd drivers are gonna be stable, since their drivers are usually never stable",rtx_3080
"Rdna1 only launched with tiny gpu's. And they already stated a 50% perf/watt. We don't really know what that means yet, but if it's rx 5700xt +50%, that's a damn efficient card. AMD would be matching the 2080 ti at significantly less power consumption. But AMD's likely to up the CU count this generation, so I wouldn't be surprised if they've got something that beats the 2080 ti while still drawing less power.",rtx_3080
Bitwit’s video showed it consuming 460W. Think I’m fine.,rtx_3080
"people didn't actually look at the GRAPH, only the 1x9. Then they say nvidia ""lied""",rtx_3080
"Yep. 2kiliksphilip did actually [replicate the Nvidia claim using a 60 fps cap in Control](https://youtu.be/SwX_eKUOyFg?t=563). But overall power usage has definitely gone up, and by a fairly similar amount to the overall increase in performance.  

Of course, it will be interesting to see what Nvidia can do with 5nm (and Hopper) on the efficiency front.",rtx_3080
"I haven’t taken transistor physics in 20 years, so I could be way off, but is this power increase because they have to up the voltage to make the transistors stable at a given frequency?  Or is there another reason for the power increase?",rtx_3080
"Yeah, but if you look at the performance per watt at stock, where nearly everyone will be running it, the improvement is less than 10%. So that's kind of irrelevant. If the only way to see the perf/watt gain is by removing the performance you gained by buying the new card, I don't really see the point. Pascal was impressive because it had a massive increase in perf/watt at stock. The 1080 drew 60-70w less than the 980ti while outperforming it by 25-30% on average. So when Nvidia called this a Pascal moment during their presentation, they were wayyy overselling it. This is a fermi-like launch, but the lack of competition, and the nifty card design makes it less obvious.",rtx_3080
"Samsung 8N sucks power like crazy after a certain frequency.

TSMC 7nm or even 5nm will provide huge gains.",rtx_3080
"> I am personally curious like why it seems more difficult like to gain more perf/watt improvement in GPU technically than in CPU

It's an issue across the board, even with CPU. Look up Dennard Scaling. The issue is that we've been at a point for a while where shrinking processes causes the designers to have to deal with more and more current leakage, which ramps up heat.",rtx_3080
It's worth mentioning that there is a large enough population of those of us in PC gaming with cheap power that we don't really even consider power consumption relevant.,rtx_3080
I  just wanna know why ppl care about power usage so much lol. These are not laptops,rtx_3080
Why does this matter? Outside of needing to upgrade your PSU why care about performance per watt?,rtx_3080

"The efficiency is pitiful, plain and simple.",rtx_3080

What leaks? Haven’t seen any.,rtx_3080
"I'm going to go on a limb and say the FE, despite its better than expected cooling solution, will still be behind AIBs when it comes to cooling and noise level.  A tried and true rule when it comes to air cooling is more fans = less heat and less heat = less noise.  I think there's a reason we aren't seeing a single AIB with only 2 fans.",rtx_3080
What do you mean limited power delivery? What does that mean for me? Someone who doesn't overclock anything and just plugs and plays.,rtx_3080
"How is it a small increase, it obviously depends on the game but for example with Warzone at 1440 it’s a 40% gain over a 2080ti.

Why would you compare a ocd 2080ti with a stock card? Wait till we get better overclocked results and cards once people actually have a chance to tune them.

Not to mention all this testing is without driver and game optimizations. 

This is a solid step up from a 2080ti assuming same $ and the reduction in price makes it an incredible step up.",rtx_3080
"No shit, that’s technology lmao. Also, most people with a 2080 ti will probably wait for a 3080 super or the 3090.. trust me they don’t have $ issues",rtx_3080

He puts getting amd fans clicks and interaction above being unbiased.",rtx_3080
How does that work exactly? Only a 7-15 increase at 2k but higher at 4K ??,rtx_3080
"Right, that's a 3080 vs an \*OCed\* 2080 Ti, and you're still seeing 20%+ performance increase in 4k. You're not comparing like with like if you put a stock card against an OCed one.",rtx_3080
"They don’t even look at the breakdown of games, they just quote the average, when a third of the games are so poorly optimised there is barely any gap between 2080s-2080ti-3080 (far cry). Of course the average is pulled down by these, remove them and the 3080 is a very strong 30% faster",rtx_3080
Dumbest people on the internet but I blame the echo chamber voting system. If you had like a top contrarian and a top pro thread it would really help with the circlejerking/anti-jerking.,rtx_3080
This needs to be pinned on the homepage.,rtx_3080
"That's not what we're seeing, though. Benchmarks have 3080 out-performing 2080 Ti by 20%ish in 1440, and 30%ish in 4k. At not much more than half the price of a 2080 Ti, that is an amazing jump in performance, and tracks with the 3070 being roughly equal in 2080 Ti in performance at a third of the price.",rtx_3080
"Lmao, did we watch the same reviews? On average, the 3080 outperforms the 2080ti by a solid 30% at a little more than half the price. The 2080 (not super) gets outperformed by around 70% (at least in games that don't have garbage optimization...) at the same price. Yes, it's a little behind the 100% claims (although they can be reached, so technically they didn't lie to us), but it's damn impressive nonetheless",rtx_3080
"Thanks for the suggestion but FYI for those looking, Techgage didn't cover it. Part of the issue is that most of the times you would be running these things on Linux and basically everybody is just benchmarking in Windows.

I see that previously Phoronix has published TensorFlow ResNet training benchmarks (e.g. [https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=rocm19-nvidia415-compute&num=4](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=rocm19-nvidia415-compute&num=4)). I guess that's fair enough. I'd like to see more architectures, PyTorch as well, etc. but it should be representative. Bad news is that it doesn't seem like Phoronix has the RTX 3080 yet.

May also want to check lambdalabs but they don't have anything yet either for performance: [https://lambdalabs.com/blog/deep-learning-hardware-deep-dive-rtx-30xx/](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/deep-learning-hardware-deep-dive-rtx-30xx/)

These cards are likely pretty good for deep learning but I don't think Nvidia wants to cannibalize their sales of higher margin products with highlighting this use case on RTX 3080.

Indeed, if I were you I would wait a bit to check about the AIB, especially if you have fun doing the OC itself (it costs time but it is satisfying to me). I am with 2080S now and will wait and see AMD offering and decide later.",rtx_3080

Will it be compatible with my current MOBO? I looked at the support page and I only see the non-K versions listed in there. I know the list isn't life or death but will it be compatible? I'm running a TUF Gaming B365M plus gaming board rn.

Because they went with DX11 for some strange reason.,rtx_3080
Is Nvidia’s support known you be bad? Which AIB has the best customer service?,rtx_3080
But on numerous revievs max power draw of the whole pc is around 520 and with very power hungry cpus. I even read one with total system draw 478 with 9900k. 850w is even more overkill than nvidias recommended 750w.,rtx_3080
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking rn. When the 2000 series Released. Everyone was too busy getting the aib cards. The FE cards sat for a while. Might have to get another FE,rtx_3080
"You're probably right about that. I might have jumped the gun a few years too early on ultrawide. I figured I might get reasonable fps on 3440x1440 with a 3080, [but many of the games aren't even hitting 100fps average in 1440p.](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-amd-3900-xt-vs-intel-10900k/)",rtx_3080

"The 3080 is only 10% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti when it comes to RDR2, add to that it's pulling a whopping 350w (Asus TUF 3080).

In Flight simulator at 1440p the 3080 is only 7% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti. To me that is just crazy, of course in other games it demolishes the 2080ti but man was I expecting better when it comes those 2 titles.",rtx_3080

I’m really surprised at how much people are spending on tech. It seems a lot of money that would go elsewhere is going into the hands of all the big tech giants.

You're out of your mind if you think OC'ing one of these cards is going to get you a 25% performance increase.,rtx_3080
I saw the GN review and Steve mentioned that the FE is power limited so he can't push the overclock further. Some AIBs might have increased power limits which may help,rtx_3080
Keep in mind the fe card has pretty tight power limits in vbios go sub if you wanna get a big ic w/o hardware mods,rtx_3080
10-25% is a pretty high expectation.,rtx_3080
"I'd be surprised if you can get much more OC performance out of them. The reality is that they're already factory OC'd, that's half the reason they're consuming so much power and idle at higher temperatures. This is Nvidia trying to make their performance target out of reach for AMD, and says a lot about how concerned they are about the Big Navi launch.

I'm sure there'll be people who can get 10-15% more frames... but they won't mention the glitches and bugs that occur due to calculation errors.

It's not the first time they've done this, e.g. with the 780 Ti they had similar power requirements in order to beat the R9 290X. And with the 780Ti, overclocking couldn't squeeze out as much extra performance as other Nvidia cards could at the time.

The interesting thing is that this time the timing is the other way around - Nvidia's launching first, and AMD's going to follow within just a couple of months.",rtx_3080
"If you see GNs video, you'll see the efficiency of the chip drops a lot when oc'ed. Add to that AIBs coming pre over clocked, I doubt there will be much room left.",rtx_3080
By all account AIBs coolers for the 3080 seem worse than nvidia's design with leaks saying that nvidia's FE cooler costs $150 per card.,rtx_3080
"We'll have to wait a couple weeks for the custom AIBs with raised power limits to see the true OC potential. I have no choice but to get the EVGA XC3 line which unfortunately may get me 2-5% less than FE numbers. 

Hopefully we'll be able to flash the bios for higher power limits with these cards. I flashed my 2080 Ti FE so I could get to 123% but funnily enough I ended up limiting to 86% with my 150MHz OC to keep thermals down. I only lost 2-3 fps in 4K by having the power limit down so even then 15% increase may only be achievable in very few game engines.",rtx_3080
DLSS will be so much better once DLSS 3.0 comes out and you can use it in pretty much any game.,rtx_3080

Linus Tech Tips stated in there video the GPU consistently boosted to 2Ghz on load. Making AIBs imo irrelevant with there overclocks. Plus with a waterblock. Think ill be going FE edition,rtx_3080
"The 3080 founders edition is power limited to ~375w. In that case it is only about 30% better than a 2080 ti. Some of the AIB will push this over 400w. So still a significant improvement, but not enough for a lot of people to upgrade if they have something recent.",rtx_3080

Do you have 144hz monitor? I heard that for every hz you can get 2 fps. Or something like that. So if you have 60hz monitor you are capable of getting 120 fps if ur other parts allow for it. I could be wrong,rtx_3080

Doubt you'll need more than a 650w Psu if it's a quality unit and you go for a 4700x to match the 3080. Power draw won't go above 500w unless you have a ton of extra stuff in your system,rtx_3080
"Trust me, I've been debating on what I should upgrade first since the reveal of Ampere, but I think I'm gonna stick with buying a 3080 now and waiting for Ryzen 4000 series. I watched Gamers Nexus' [Skylake revisted video](https://youtu.be/LCV9yyD8X6M) from 2019, and the 6700K still holds its own at 1440p when overclocked. I have mine clocked at 4.5GHz, so not quite as high as in the video, but it's decent.

While I don't disagree that the high-end Ryzen chips are faster than a 6700K, the difference may be smaller than you expect. As you can see in the video, in some scenarios, an overclocked 6700K matches, or sometimes even outperforms (within a few %) a 3900X. Even at 1080p. At 1440p the gap is made even smaller.",rtx_3080
I'm over here with an overclocked 5820k and a 1080ti and can't think of a single vr game that keeps me cpu bound. Everything for me is gpu bound when it comes to vr.,rtx_3080

"Why not? Seriously though, some people are still selling their 2080ti for around $600. You could sell your 2080ti and buy a 3080 for a mere $99 difference. Is a 30% performance not worth $99 to you?

Good luck friend,rtx_3080
"If I wanted all my current games and the stuff coming out from now until the next card release to run in 1080p at 60 fps would you say that's impossible? Highly unlikely unless the game is buggy or something.

I am looking for the same thing but for 4k 60fps. I will pay whatever it costs to get as close to that as possible. If that's a 3090 then I will get it. If it's still not possible I will get a 3090 and enjoy that until the next card releases that holds promise. 

I get what you are saying Watch Dogs 3 maxed out with ray tracing on may not run 4k 60fps on my  i9-10900X and 3090 FTW. But I will get as close as I can. Like I doubt Flight Sim will get to 4k 60fps on a 3090 but I will still try.

Okay. First of all, contrary to how many people erroneously refer to it as such, 2k resolution is not a thing in computer monitors. 2k is basically cinematic 1080p and it is NOT 1440p. Second, “UHD” refers specifically to 4K. The resolution you are referring to with those two terms literally does not exist.",rtx_3080

In RDR2 the 3080 was 10% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti at 1440p. On top of that the 3080 was pulling 363w which is crazy.

In STR the 3080 is 20% faster than an OC'ed 2080ti.

I understand it's a monster of a card due to all the new bells and whistles but I was under the impression that it was at least 30% faster across the board in most popular titles.

You probably already know this, but I wanted to point it out just in case. While the cooler may be more efficient and the die might have a lower temperature than your 5700XT, overall it is producing ~100W more of heat so your room will in fact get hotter.

So yes, off course 2080ti owners would check if the card is faster than their OC'd cards they are using. That's the whole reason people look at benchmarks. Of course once the AIB partners release their 3080versions with unlocked bios, higher power limits i want to see those perform in their OC mode vs the 2080ti as well.

I imagine the higher the resolution you play at, the more likely you'll see the 2080 TI coming out on top vs the 3070.

Is it the fault of the CPU? sure, but as it stands people that play for insane 300+ FPS will see little benefit to this GPU, and sure maybe 720p players can migrate to 1080p. But this card is NOT for CSGO, Valorant, Overwatch players that want to move to 1440p.",rtx_3080
"Mostly to improve my 1% lows and reduce the variation and fluctuations.

Going from an uncapped 400hz to 244hz just because someone threw a smoke grenade is not how I like to live my life.

"Turing was actually better as well. I can't recall a generation that was worse than the one before.

He says over and over again that the GTX 1080 is 2x the performance of a Titan X (Maxwell). [According to techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-titan-x.c2632) it's only 28% faster. Sounds familiar, right?",rtx_3080
it was about the same. The difference is that the gap could still be high at 1080p and 1440p as the CPU were less of a limiting factor. (If at all),rtx_3080

I don't know, I'm just as confused as everyone else at this point. I didn't even know there were 2 variants of the XC3 Black.",rtx_3080

"Well yeah, that's exactly my point. Not many people are going to have the money for all that different stuff for just 1 hobby. 

I have a 65"" C9 OLED from last year that I got for $1700 on Black Friday (the big US shopping day in November)...I'd recommend searching for a deal on that vs the 48"" CX.

Edit: I also had a $2700 65"" C6 that developed a stuck green sub pixel after a little over 2 years (after the warranty expired). Wasn't horrible and a little annoying during dark scenes to have a green sub pixel always shining, but was a good excuse to upgrade to a G-Sync OLED. Point of the story, may be worth it to budget in an extended warranty if you go that route.",rtx_3080

">Year by year, Boost OC takes the fun away from manual OC.

Yep.

In my mind whatever the card automatically achieves out of the box (in a well cooled installation) is the baseline, which is what the benchmarks we are seeing here reflect. The automatic overclocking featured in this generation of cards seems to already be realizing most of the overclocking potential, so we shouldn't expect to see much further OC unless AIBs offer much higher power limits and much better cooling.

At this point I am interested to see how benchmarks of ASUS/MSI/EVGA's top tier SKUs compare to these FE results, but I think the 3080 isn't a big enough upgrade coming from a 2080ti running +1960mhz core / 8000mhz mem.",rtx_3080
You're excused.,rtx_3080
"I flashed the bios on my 2080 Ti to go from 114% to 123% power limit or something like that. Never was able to get past +163MHz OC stable regardless of power limit. In the end I settled on 86% power limit for thermals and still could hit +163MHz stable. There was only like +/- 4fps difference in 4K between the lowest and highest power limit, so the actual internal components were the bottle next of the reference board regardless of bios. (Others may have seen bigger gains with a bios flash but just my experience in a warm ITX case).",rtx_3080

"Dam I paid 1200$ for a 55” B9 and thought that was a good deal. Love it though, and where it is I couldn’t fit bigger than 55” anyway. The tv reviewer Vince made a big fuss over the difference between the B9 and C9, but Rtings and everyone else said it’s basically down to panel variance for any noticeable difference. I also know it’s way brighter than my NU8000 which is supposed to be 800 nits. I’ve even seen one next to a Q90R both on standard, and the B9 looked way brighter. And I had a TCL R617 in 2018 for like 2 weeks before I returned it due to DSE, but hat Tv Was awesome otherwise. The B9 seems just as bright, and that one is 1200 nits. Supposedly twice as bright as the B9, but they looked the same to me as far as brightness. 

Either way it’s amazing, and so was gaming in 1440p 120hz on my 2070s on it. Looking forward to try 4k/120hz after 9:00 AM lol",rtx_3080

Eventually got rid of it cause it was a $600 ultrawide with some compromises and I wanted something higher quality. Spending 1k on a monitor and 1k on a GPU every two years to drive it properly just didn't seem like a reasonable use of my money even though the experience was really good.",rtx_3080
