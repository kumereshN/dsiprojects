"Both Hardware Canucks and JayzTwocents mentioned Bestbuy being the FE retailer for Canada in their 3070 videos. I haven't been able to find any official announcement, but I wonder if this is true, and if they will also sell 3080 and 3090 FE's.

So are we expecting a 6am PT release on Thursday? I believe thats the time the 2080 dropped.,rtx_3070
Anyone know what time it releases and where?,rtx_3070
Solid reviews! Sure would be cool to actually purchase one! -_-,rtx_3070
"I saw people just yesterday saying that the 3070 was a ""terrible"" value for price/performance.

Turns out, that's not true. Just because the 3080 is better in that facet than normal doesn't mean that the 3070 is irrelevant. Great card for 1440p, 100+hz and even 4k60 in plenty of titles. Plus, in games that support DLSS 2.0 going forward, you'll be able to hit basically any standard performance threshold even with RT on.

Great card to upgrade to for 10-series and even low 20-series owners.",rtx_3070

"As someone who's building his first PC in 15 years, this ...is madness.  At least I understood the demand side of the crypto currency.  I don't understand this launch at all.  Thursday will basically be the last time I try to get a card in 2020.  If it doesn't work out, I'll see you all in 2021 when the first 32"" 4k 144hz IPS monitors start coming out.

If things are still fucked then, well, I guess I'm waiting till AM5?  Honestly I don't care enough about gaming to go camp out at a microcenter at 11pm the night before.  I'll go read a fucking book.",rtx_3070
From a 2080 and looking for 4K/60 max looks like 3080 is the winner,rtx_3070
So what's the best way for a normal person to get a 3070 tomorrow? Do I need to just have nvidia and Best Buy up and start smashing F5 at 5:59am or is there something more I could be doing?,rtx_3070
I wonder what is this new ray tracing tech arstechnica mentioned?,rtx_3070
"I want one. Feels like the best price/performance ratio for someone still on 1080p (albeit 144Hz). Also with a 550W rated PSU and looking to upgrade to a 5800X down the road I wouldn't dare push it with any beefier GPU.

"Amazing card for 1440p, as the gap is the smallest vs 2080ti/3080 etc. Also 8gb vram unlikely to be a issue at this resolution 

For 4k though, not a good buy at all imo . Guess that's not the target audience anyway",rtx_3070

"German shops are listing it above €600 (the Eagle, one of the cheaper cards), that's mad. Considering the $ is 0.85 Euros at the moment, the €499 should convert to €426. Now add 19% tax, it's €507. Then some premium for being from a board partner, it should be well below €600 for a lower model. It's listed at $499 on BestBuy in the US, there's no way we should be paying a €100 premium. Problem is that the GPU market in Germany is mostly online and no mainstream markets are involved, so the shops won't be held accountable for their pricing.",rtx_3070
I hope they drop some 3080s and 3090s at the same time.,rtx_3070
"Was thinking of upgrading from my 1070 Ti to a 3070, but the 8GB of VRAM gives me worry. Wondering if I should wait until next year for the inevitable 3070 SUPER/Ti to see if they bump it up to 10GB or 12GB of VRAM to give it a little bit of future-proofing breathing room.",rtx_3070

"Looks to be alright performance, a bit disappointed in the price, it seems we have never recovered in price from the mining boom. Its looking like stores will sell the 3070 for $1100-1200 NZD here, that was the price of the 1080ti on release, the top card at the time (aside from Titan).",rtx_3070

Does anybody know if 3070 FE card has stock zero rpm mode?,rtx_3070
If anyone could give me some advice it would be appreciated. I was going for a 3080 when they released for the main reason it is one of the best cards out there at the minute but thinking about it i'm not sure if I should just go with a 3070 instead. I don't really play a lot of brand new games anyway and i'm really just waiting for valhalla and battlefield 6 (maybe cyberpunk not sure) and the rest of the games I play regularly my 1080 ti handles on full settings at 1440p. Would it be wiser to save a few hundred pounds and go with a 3070? I probably wont even be able to get one tomorrow but i'm tempted to give it a try if it's worth it.,rtx_3070

At this point if I can't get an RTX card then I'm probably going to try for an RX 6800XT. It seems very compelling for the price and the only thing I'd really be missing out on is DLSS but that isn't a deal breaker for me.,rtx_3070

">So are we expecting a 6am PT release on Thursday? I believe thats the time the 2080 dropped.

I feel like NVIDIA learned this time not to set a set time, since it won't make a difference and will jam up all the servers.",rtx_3070
9am Eastern iirc,rtx_3070
The guy from the YouTube Channel TechDeals said the 3080 has better price/performance value. He says either the 3080 is priced $100 too low or the 3070 is priced $100 too high.,rtx_3070
I think we are so used to losing a lot of price/performance when going higher that it seems weird to see very close performance per dollar between 3070 and 3080,rtx_3070
"I'm not going to bother with 4K, I just want a good card that will last me several years. And is VRAM a big enough thing to worry about? 3070 has 8GB, the new AMD has double that for not much more price.",rtx_3070
Heard in some reviews that it will be best buy and microcenter only for the US,rtx_3070

"The 6800 is about 16% more performance for 16% more cost, putting it in a very awkward spot where it's closer to the 6800xt than the 3070 in pricing, and you can make the very strong argument that it's better to just swing for the xt instead at that point. More than 8gb vram is really nice, but for what's still going to be a not particularly strong performing 4k card anyways that'll be defunct in other ways before it even needs 16gb vram, it's pretty overkill.

Then when you include the software side of things, I really don't think the 6800 threatens the 3070's position, like the 6800xt/6900xt threaten the 3080/3090.",rtx_3070

"I have a computer with everything but a graphics card and the 3070 is coming out tomorrow, is it worth waiting until mid november? I have no brand loyalty",rtx_3070
"Honestly I think the instance demand just happened to be the perfect storm of things. The 3000 series is the first in a while where the jump in price/performance seems great. Last gen was lacking, people decided to skip it. People on 900 series cards and earlier see the 3000 series as the perfect upgrade opportunity. Pandemic caused manufacturing issues. Some people have some additional spending money because of covid and also want some new toys for entertainment. 

So many things fell into place to make demand crazy.",rtx_3070
"> when the first 32"" 4k 144hz IPS monitors start coming out

I personally won't have any interest in those until we have a sub-$1,000, 4K 100 FPS+ GPU to drive them. We don't have anything even close to that this generation. By the time we do have those GPUs the new monitor tech will have matured more anyway.

I'd rather get a card that can truly utilize the monitor, and second gen 4K 144Hz IPS monitors will probably already be shipping by that time. In essence, when they first release they are technically irrelevant to me.

May I ask, are you interested in these monitors for any non-gaming reasons?",rtx_3070

"I was there for the 3080 launch. There were 30 people in line. they had 2 cards in stock, and handed out vouchers to the next 11 people saying that trucks would arrive later in the day. I did not get a card.",rtx_3070
I try not to shitpost in official threads,rtx_3070
It’s still gonna be a close call in regard to whether you’ll be able to get one in time. We’re over a month into the 3080 launch and it’s still bad.,rtx_3070
"Same. I was on the hunt because I didn't want to start playing with my 980ti, but now I have almost two months to upgrade.",rtx_3070
Starting a month later would actually arguably be better because they will have fixed bugs!,rtx_3070
Main issue would be spoilers considering the hype.,rtx_3070
Why is that the worst-case scenario? I'm confused haha,rtx_3070

"From what I've read/heard from folks familiar with it, Europe is getting the shaft so America can have more stock. Nvidia's marketing is heavily leaning into the US market to drive up hype.

"Sign up for accounts and have payment info pre filled on all of the major sites (newegg, bestbuy, amazon, etc.). I doubt nvidia will be selling on their site because of the mess they had with the 3080/90 on there. Apple pay might be a good way to go too. 

Good luck, if it's anything like the 3080/90 release it'll be a miracle if you can beat the bots and scalpers.",rtx_3070
Highly recommend using the Best Buy app,rtx_3070
Worth noting that he based it off pure CUDA core count and not real world benchmarks.,rtx_3070
"Well then he is a moron.  At best the 3080 is 30% faster while being 40% more expensive.

Compared to past line-ups, the 3080 might be a better value...  But it's not better performance-per-dollar than the 3070.",rtx_3070
"FE is a best buy exclusive in at least the US according to Best Buy and NVIDIA.

Lol, this is me.  I had a 'fun money' budget set aside for travel because I have a hard time spending money on myself.  Half got donated, and I was *supposed* to be able to spend the other half freely, but I'm deep into the same analysis paralysis that I always have.",rtx_3070
"I come in the additional spending money. I just got another nvme drive, went triple monitor, assembled a 2nd rig and a few more misc things.

Fuck these garbage prices on GPUs.",rtx_3070
"The biggest thing is just the realization that everyone will spend most of the winter completely at home. Europe is closing off already, US might also depending on who wins Nov 3rd. Covid isn't gone and won't be for a while.",rtx_3070
"Haven't half of this whole argument been debunked already? Many retailers openly told how many cards they got and it was ridiculously low, something like 3% of what they are ordered and nowhere on par with 2000 series amount. Even if you count for slowed down delivery, manufacturing, higher demand, does it account for more than 95% less product? I think it's quite clear this was a paper launch to hype people up against AMD cards and they were absolutely not ready to ship it. The whole fiasco with capacitators and partners not being able to even properly test their own card kinda seals the deal what a trainwreck of managment this was.",rtx_3070
The real estate is useful for coding and I will probably be getting a ps5 at some point (hdmi 2.1 needed). Basically I want one monitor to rule them all. Gpus will be replaced a lot more often than the monitor.,rtx_3070
"Yep, right now we are at a generational breakpoint, where ~$1000 can get you both a 1440p 144hz IPS monitor and a GPU that can consistently deliver those frames at max/near-max settings. It's a great time for someone who has been patiently gaming at 1080p to make the jump up.

Unfortunately 4k right now is both expensive and comes with major sacrifices. 4k 120hz OLED TVs start at ~$1500. 4k 144hz monitors at ~$800. Even a 3090 can't consistently push out all those frames (avg fps ~100, with demanding titles 60-70 fps)

I suspect in two generations (~4-5years), we will be at another breakpoint where both GPUs and monitors will sync up in terms of 4k high refresh performance and affordability.",rtx_3070
I'm in central so it'll be 8am for me.,rtx_3070
How do normal people buy from API? Is there a script out there we can use? Sorry if even asking this violates a rule.,rtx_3070
It's a platinum rated Seasonic with a 540W/45A rated 12V rail. It shouldn't break a sweat with a 5800x coupled with a 3070/Radeon 6800..,rtx_3070

"No DLSS either as well on the AMD cards so Nvidia still has an edge in DLSS games...
strong numbers from AMD though, hopefully that reduces demand for the 3 series cards 😁",rtx_3070
Gamers Nexus had some slides showing low single digit percentage gains.,rtx_3070
"Doubling the VRAM would add a ton to the price, though. If they can add any extra VRAM for the SUPER/Ti edition I'm thinking they only do it if it keeps the price under $649.",rtx_3070

"If you are planning on playing cyberpunk on a 30 series card, but don't have one in time, than you would have to wait a few more weeks to play (if you are unwilling to play on low settings). Worst case senario is having to wait to play. However, what I'm indicating is that since the game is singleplayer, there is nothing you have to worry about missing out on. The experience you recieve from a singleplayer game does not deteriorate over time as some mulitplayer games do.

For example: Among Us has a strong playerbase right now. However, once the playerbase is gone, finding a match online will be difficult, and thus would negatively effect your gaming experience. This negative factor is not present in Cyberpunk due to it being singleplayer. The content will always be readily available, and will only improve over time through patches.",rtx_3070
Maybe we'll be able to get a 3080 by then too!,rtx_3070

They will not have FE's at launch, but this seems to imply they will get them eventually",rtx_3070
In games where frame rate is important you can turn down details. You don’t need 144fps in RDR2 lol. Tbf I’m pretty sure COD ran at ~100fps with my 2080 on Ultra with RTX,rtx_3070
well after benchmarks it turns out it was way better at RT :P,rtx_3070
Central as well. Guess I'll give it a shot,rtx_3070
Super resolution is on its way but they've been sort of secretive about its exact nature it mayu not be as good fidelity wise as DLSS but it will probably do just fine!,rtx_3070

Buy it and hold on it till the return policy allows you to. Hopefully some benchmarks would have leaked for AMD,rtx_3070
it wasn't in development for 7 years tho,rtx_3070

Damn. I got a 2nd hand 2080ti for 400€ though so im kind a happy. Im pretty sure 3070 is gonna be out of stock in EU anyway and there is noway I can find the card for MSRP so fuck it I thing it was a good deal.,rtx_3070

I hit that 100-110 on low settings 1440p. Overclocked 1080ti. Some spots hit 144 but mostly it's averaging around 110. Your cpu is a bit better in gaming than mine so you might get better fps in something cpu intensive.,rtx_3070
