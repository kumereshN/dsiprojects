"Wow guru3d actually commented on the pricing situation, I hope this makes more people aware that these cards should be $300 again to make it competitive with consoles. It’s good value compared to 3070 absolutely but it’s still too expensive for budget minded pc gamers. We need a lot more cards in the <=$300 space. This is especially important for those living outside of USA where prices are even more ridiculous ($600 in Canada, same price as series x).",rtx_3060ti
"Like a lot of people here, I have a 500W PSU and a 1060 6gb. I also have an older i5 4690 cpu at stock clocks.

 I'd like to upgrade my GPU to this, but they recommend a 600W psu. Considering my CPU is not high-end, would I likely be ok with a 500W PSU until I upgrade my CPU?",rtx_3060ti
"Seems like a great card and it seems like the RTX3050Ti/60 will be similarly great products but... I don't know how I'm gonna keep up with the price level increase. This MSRP with AIBs and EUR conversions will be easily above 500 when it hits my retailers. And then I'm optimistic to say stock levels won't be a problem in a few months. And exchange rates in my country are dogshit, with 500 eur prices this card is gonna cost 200k HUF. That's insane. An entire PS5/XSX is cheaper than that.

And this is the 60 line, the supposedly mainstream, mid-range cards for everyday Joe's like me. I'm paying the same for middle tier cards ass I used to pay for the premium best.

Oh well, maybe I'll get lucky with a 60Ti or I'm waiting for the poverty edition cards (and I mean, I could pay for these, but it's hard for me to justify spending this much on gaming).",rtx_3060ti

"Hmm.. as a RTX 3070 owner, this release is a little surprising by nvidia. All cards get replaced eventually.. but 3070 only launched a month ago itself, and this card sort of makes 3070 irrelevant as a purchase.

It is practically the same card, with a slight performance downgrade and notable drop in price (and maybe even more so if the number shipped is as high as its sounding compared to 3070.. leading to less inflation).

If you wanted to go higher than 3060TI, RX6800 with extra vram would now make much more sense as a jump up to justify the price increase..

I get the feeling we are going to get a 3070TI and 3080TI soon with double vram and 3070 and 3080 just disappear overnight. Maybe AMD really did surprise nvidia this much.",rtx_3060ti

"Looks like this should be a decent upgrade to a 1080 TI, but at around half the cost of the 1080 TIs at launch. Pre-scalper price, obviously.",rtx_3060ti
"I've decided that I am more than likely sitting this out. The 3060 Ti doesn't meet my needs, so I'll wait for the baseline 3060 and AMD's eventual competitor. I COULD settle for a 3060 Ti under certain scenarios, but it's unlikely.

Why doesn't it work for me? I typically buy the latest midrange for my main rig (currently 2060), and move my existing card to my lighter living room build (currently 1060), so I get two upgrades in one. But because I have an SFF case on my desk and noise is of importance to me, I lean towards lower power draw and less noise. I cap myself at single 8-pin, which eliminates all the top AIB variants of the 3060 Ti. And my MSI Gaming Z 2060, a 190W card, is a little warmer and louder than I'd like in some workloads. The lowest 3060 Ti is 200W. That's the wrong direction for me.

Ideally I'd like to be at or under 150W (the 960/1060/1660 @ 120W was perfect).

I sometimes include my wife's World of Warcraft system in my hand-me-down projections. She currently has a white Gigbayte RTX 2060 in an all-white build. So if there was a single 8-pin white 3060 Ti, I'd consider it. 

I could also see getting the 3060 Ti FE, given it's conservative fan profile and stricter adherence to the 200W power limit. But my experience with the x60 FE models is that Nvidia, at least in the US, does 1-2 drops then ceases selling it. So if I get lucky and see it in NV's store tomorrow (not likely), I'll consider an impulse buy. Realistically, it will be gone and I'll wait for the 3060.",rtx_3060ti

"HUB's review seemed biased to me for some reason... Not enabling DLSS because they're comparing ""apples to apples"" just sounds like some excuse. People who want to watch a review surely want to know how the card performs in every situation, not who wins the brand fight between AMD and nvidia, which HUB seems to weirdly focus on. This should not be about being fair to AMD with the comparisons, but instead about sharing objective information so people can get the card that performs on the level they want for the games they play. I've been noticing a raising amount of subjectivity in HUB's reviews of these cards, his personal opinion affects the tests they run and the information they present, which is not the best for the people watching, doesn't matter how many times he mentions ""it's my personal preference"", reviews needs to be objective.  At this point I unsubbed that channel already.",rtx_3060ti
This is the first card I have seen in over four years that I think is worth buying brand new to upgrade over Pascal. I got my 1070 for $450 and not a single card since then has had a price to performance to make any upgrade worth it. I can sell my 1070 and pay the difference of about $200 for the 3060 Ti and get a >80% performance gain. Finally we have a new value high-performance card.,rtx_3060ti

"Honestly, if you can't afford more than 400 for a gpu, you might be better off with one of the new consoles. So far their performance is insanely impressive imo. We keep seeing borderlands 3 used as a benchmark with the cheapest gpu able to get 4k 60fps on it being the 3080. They just released a patch allowing the xbsx and ps5 to run at 4k 60fps and up to 1080p 120fps. Yes, it's not native 4k , but still that's really impressive and it will still look pretty great. It's just so cheap and so good , while pc builders including me are over here spending $1200 at least to get a decently capable pc.

"I was “fixing” my gtx 980/4790k gaming rig a couple days ago. My son mentioned it was having issues, so I dug into it and pulled up some benchmark tools. 

I immediately realized the cpu AND the gpu were throttling. The 980 was pegging out at 80c under any decent load. The CPU was maxing out its temps and cutting MHz. 

I opened the 980 up (seven screws), cleaned off the old crusty thermal paste, and threw a little thermal paste on the 980. She cooled right back down and is running beautifully again. I even overclocked it a bit. Did the same to the 4790k and bolted the water cooler block back onto it.

It’s about that time. The 980 is getting older. Assuming you bought your 980 when it released, they’re five and a half years old. Get yourself some new thermal paste and she’ll run like new again. There’s still plenty of life in a 980 build. They handle high FPS 1080p and 1440p gaming just fine with minimal sacrifices, and I played through half life Alyx on my rift just fine on the same rig.

Ideally, both bar graphs should be shown.

With that said, while I sympathize with HUB’s desire to have as apples-to-apples a comparison as possible, the reality is that the software ecosystem does matter. It’s arguably hasn’t mattered this much since the Glide API made 3Dfx the undisputed graphics king of the 90s.

Not really and depends on how much you paid.,rtx_3060ti
I got an omen 2080 super too which is 150 watts so should only be a little bit slower than this but I don't regret it. I wasn't ready to have a tower at the moment so my only choice was a laptop and also I prefer to play games on a smaller screen so 1080p performance is what matters to me. The other thing is though how tf are you gonna get any of these new GPUs hahaha. I'm happy I've got a laptop I can play on,rtx_3060ti

If you overclock, I have no doubt you can get the 3060TI even closer to stock 3070 performance. 3060TI looks to perform really well at 1440p, and with OC,  DLSS, and some tweaking in graphics settings, you will have no problem getting higher framerates.",rtx_3060ti

My point is they are not really showing how the card performs but rather how it competes against AMD. Notice how many times they mentioned the 5700XT (that was also a great card don't get me wrong). Their subjectivity should come in the final thoughts not on the tests they run. Look at GN for a good example of an objective review.",rtx_3060ti

It would do quite well in a modern build, and if you already have it, it’s a nice way to save some cash until these 30xx series cards are more widely available... or even longer (the 980 will probably still be usable when the 40xx and even 50xx cards are out). 

It can’t do RTX and you won’t be doing high frame rate 4K gaming on it... but esports titles will burn 165hz+ at 1440p, and it’ll push 60fps “pretty” games with settings more or less maxed out. It’ll run cyberpunk. You might have to turn a few graphical settings down a hair, but I doubt it’ll make a noticeable difference in the quality as you’re enjoying your play through.

Take the old paste off with a bit of 91% alcohol on a cotton swab. Clean the heat sink and the die. Apply a small amount of thermal paste and bolt it together.

But that's exactly the point, they *are* showing how the card performs. Turning DLSS on doesn't mean the card is performing better, it just means it's getting more FPS from that performance. The games they benchmark are supposed to be a representation of all games, not just games with DLSS. It's much more useful to know the actual native performance of the card because that's applicable to all games, and then if there's a game you care about with DLSS then you can add the bonus FPS on top of that.

> Notice how many times they mentioned the 5700XT

What? Is it not standard practice to make comparisons? It's completely normal to demonstrate what the generational improvement is, and he did that by mentioning *both* the 5700XT and 2060 Super a lot. In this case the 5700XT is also the closest thing the 3060Ti has to a price competitor. That doesn't mean he's biased, that just means he's doing his job, are you crazy?

If you’re suggesting budget gamers move down to the xx50, historically they provide a 1080p 30 FPS experience which is not ideal for anyone. Now if nvidia actually announces a rtx 3050 with ray tracing with promise of 1080p 60 at $200, or 1440p 60 without ray tracing at medium settings that would actually be a good budget option and would be similar to Xbox series s.

What are you talking about xx50 provided 1080p 30 fps. a 3060Ti IS giving 1080p 80-90 FPS at MAX. You're telling me a 3050 is going to provide 1/3 of the power of a 3060Ti?

Idk man, maybe if you really really need that 90 fps at max settings at 1080p, you're not a budget gamer. Instead of spending all the time complaining about pricing, figure out how to make an extra $200? 

Maybe I'm being mean, but if a person's salary hasn't increased enough to afford an extra $200 for a gpu in the last 8 years, I think they have bigger issues to worry about than whether they get 80 fps or 30 fps at max settings in a video game.

"To be fair, this next gen *just started* 2.5 months ago. There won't be more budget-friendly options for 4-5 more months at the earliest. We're also in the middle of a global pandemic, so production is much slower than normal, so PC parts companies haven't even satisfied the demand for their high-end products that have higher margins, so why would they be tripping over themselves to meet the demand of a smaller margin market that they still won't be able to satisfy supply wise? 

Furthermore, there are plenty of budget friendly builds you can make right now that easily gets 1080p60fps at near high settings in the majority of current games. New games coming out over the next year or so aren't going to see a huge graphical leap within the 1080p rasterization area, so something like a $150-200 GPU *right now* will still get you about 2 years of life out of it. 

Lastly, I *do* think the mid-range market is completely fucked. $200-300 used to be the mid-range sweet spot and the options at those price points are disappointing as fuck. It's why I'm sitting on my 5700 XT for *at least* another year and a half and will mostly just be sticking to my PS5 this GPU iteration since it's far better value than getting a 3080 or 6800 XT when you include the exclusive games aspect. In my opinion, the 6800 and 3060 Ti are the best perf/cost options right now, which is ridiculous but again it's still a brand new generation so it's somewhat understandable for the time being given the current circumstances.",rtx_3060ti

So was PhysiX, which came as addon card, then got absorbed into NVidias GPUs. Heck, some people used a brand new GPU for 3D, and an old one just for PhysiX.

Way back, you had a VGA card, and you bought 3D accelerators - if you wanted, until both became merged AND cheap enough.

Remember early Tessellation? Nobody could run it, but at least you didn't have to PAY for an extra piece in your GPU, and just turn it off if you don't have top of the crop GPU, until a few gens later the mid-range GPUs could do Tessellation just fine.

But you now have to PAY for the RTX component, even if you don't want to use it, even if there aren't games that barely have it, even if halves your FPS. This brute force ""must have RTX"" already kicked back with 2000 series.

>AA will become practically obsolete

AA (the real upsampling old school one) is literary rendering a game in 1440/4K and than downsampling, so if that ain't working now, you bet 4k ain't gonna work well too.

And x60 (Ti) class used to be the mid-budget kings, and now the price of x60 cards is insane. I don't care if it's better than 2070 (which was waaay too expensive), it's competing with it but with a huge expense. So where is the mid-budget now?

Nobody is buying (bought) 2060 or 3060 in large numbers, so even 1660 prices remain the same... Similarly with 1070/1080.

x50 class never was a good investment, they got the job done barely, but over time their value and pefromance dropped sharply, so are we gonna get 3050 that performs better than 2060, or a 1660 v2, or what?

"I understand that *right now* 4k is taxing for gaming. But it eventually won't be. I honestly see 4k gaming being mainstream in 6-7 years, if not sooner. 1440p is already very widespread and will quickly be the resolution the majority of PC gamers will be using. The fact that you have the consoles really pushing 4k gaming (I understand they're not capable of truly doing native 4k at 60fps with next gen graphics) means that more and more gamers will be transitioning past 1080p over the next few years. Technology will meet that demand. The 3080/6800 XT/stronger can already do native 4k60fps on almost every game out right now, their prices will not remain super expensive forever. 

And right, I understand PhysiX was super demanding back in the day. I have no doubts that RT will become much more streamlined in future GPUs and not super costly.

I completely agree that the way it's being forced down our throats in terms of options is messed up. However, the 3060 Ti is $400 and I have a feeling that AMD will have a comparable option within a year for $350 or so. If they don't, then I guess this generation of GPUs is just going to be cost restrictive and hopefully the next generation is cheaper and more accessible.

Keep in mind we're also in a pandemic, so supply chains are choked in literally every industry right now. Once the demand for their early, high-end GPUs is able to be met, they'll begin rolling out the mid-tier options. I have a feeling a lot of things have been delayed. Why launch a mid-tier option right now when you can't even come close to supplying the high-end GPUs that have a much smaller amount of demand comparatively speaking?

In the meantime, you also have AMD 5700s and 5600 XTs, those are super solid lower mid-tier cards right now, in my opinion. 5700 XT you can get for $350 on sale, which has a very good cost/performance ratio. Although, the 3060 Ti is actually even better in my opinion since it's *supposed* to only be $400. Within a couple of years that'll be down to $300, making it an amazing option.",rtx_3060ti
