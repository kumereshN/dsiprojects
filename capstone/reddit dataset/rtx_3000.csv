The claim that the 3070 is ""more powerful than a 2080 Ti"" is *only* with ray tracing and DLSS enabled. A jump in performance with ray tracing on was expected for this generation. We don't know how the new cards stack up against the current gen in non-ray tracing, non-DLSS scenarios. Games have to specifically support both of these features, and many newer AAA games still don't support them. That will change over time of course, but don't buy a 3070 thinking that you're going to get 2080 Ti performance across the board at a fraction of the price, because that's almost certainly not going to be the case.",rtx_3000

30 Series|$499|$699|$1,499

If I had gone back further, you would have seen that the 700-series prices were fairly consistent with what came before. It was the 900 series (Maxwell) where Nvidia cut prices, which gave false hope to me and raised my expectations.

The 10-series (Pascal) is where things get interesting. Nvidia, I believe, used this as a bridge product with 2 price points - one similar to the old, and one to prep us for coming price changes. Anyone who followed that launch knows that nothing was near MSRP for several months, and most partner cards treated the FE price as the real MSRP (except the 1060, which was offered at true MSRP).

You can see the price hike in the 20-series where they again did this. The prior FE price was now the baseline/MSRP, and the FE was raised further.

And now with the FE price, at least for the 70/80 products, we have been fully conditioned to accept the new price point. It took Nvidia a few generations, but now we have people cheering these ""low"" prices.

Nvidia has gone through some ups and and downs here. The 600-series (Kepler) brought forth some notable power efficiency improvements. But competition from AMD saw Nvidia re-brand this as the 700-series and push power through the roof. The 900- and 10-series brought back even more notable power efficiency improvements. But, the addition of RTX functionality brought us more in line with prior power targets with the 20-series. The 30-series seems to have thrown the old power targets out the window.

"I'm convinced nvidia did a bit of hocus pocus on the cuda core count here. This morning I was absolutely enthralled about it, but here is what I've realized: first, the core count is exactly double that of the leaks. Second, the die size has shrunk from about 800 mm^2 on the 2080 ti to 671mm^2 on the 3090. I do not believe, despite the die shrink from 12nm to 8nm, that it would be possible to fit that many cuda cores into the package unless there was a MAJOR overhaul to how the cuda architecture works. Rather, I think nvidia had devised a clever way to make a single ""cuda core"" process two threads at once. So in essence, the ""cuda cores"" of the 30 series are not the same as the cuda cores of previous gens. This would explain why performance increases are ""only"" 60-80 percent when logic would tell you they should be in excess of 200% on account of the number of cuda cores being more than doubled. It would also explain why these numbers weren't brought up in the video this morning.",rtx_3000

Diminishing returns on performance per dollar really kicks in hard here, and I don't think nvidia said anything about it's performance compared to the other cards, which makes me think that it won't be even 50% faster than 3080 at over twice the price.

Seems like they're trying to do away with the titan naming scheme, which makes sense considering how confusing keeping track of all the past titans has gotten, but I don't think this is meant for anyone but the most demanding of gamers or people who make money from their computers.

"GeForce RTX 3080 — Starting at $699, the RTX 3080 is the ultimate gaming GPU — up to 2x faster than the RTX 2080. Featuring 10GB of the new high-speed GDDR6X memory running at 19Gbps, the RTX 3080 can consistently deliver 60 frames per second for 4K resolution gaming.

GeForce RTX 3070 — Starting at $499, the RTX 3070 is faster than the RTX 2080 Ti at less than half the price, and on average is 60 percent faster than the original RTX 2070. It is equipped with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, hitting the sweet spot of performance for games running at 4K and 1440p resolutions.

GeForce RTX 3090 — At the top of the stack is the RTX 3090, priced at $1,499 and referred to as the “BFGPU” — Big Ferocious GPU. It even comes with a silencer — a three-slot, dual-axial, flow-through design that is up to 10x quieter than the TITAN RTX and keeps the GPU up to 30 degrees C cooler. Its 24GB of GDDR6X memory can tackle the toughest AI algorithms and feed massive, content creation workloads. The RTX 3090 is up to 50 percent faster than the current ultimate PC graphics card, TITAN RTX, enabling gamers to experience 60 fps in 8K resolution across many top games.



3090 is up to 50% faster than TITAN RTX, which means it definitely isn't 50% faster than 3080... for double the price.

nVidia claims double the FP32 performance per cycle on their 30 TFlops card:

8704 * 1710 * 2 * 2 = Gives roughly 59,54 TFlops in FP32

But when you calculate its FP performance with 4352 shaders, the math checks out at 29,77 TFlops.

Did they disclose anything related to the subject?

My gut tells me they have 4252 physical shaders, but since they are making the work of two per cycle, they claim 8704. Just like DDR RAM ""mhz"" since they do twice the work, they market twice the hz.",rtx_3000

Noob question here. I was thinking of trying to buy one of the founder's edition if I get lucky. I was wondering if I should just wait for a partner version instead. I read old articles on older versions of reference cards and they said they usually have heat issues and stuff. I'd like to hear opinions from my fellow peers on this topic.,rtx_3000

I hope to get it on the 17th, but if I'm not lucky I've heard from some that you might have to wait until like February. I don't particularly care whether its a FE or AIB, but knowing which is likely to have more stock would help.

Sorry if these are stupid questions, it's my first time being this excited for an upgrade!",rtx_3000
So there is the rumor about the different variant of the 3070 and 3080 with bigger vram by AIB. Is there really going to be a 16gb 3070 and how will that compare to the 10gb 3080? Is there going to be a 20gb 2080 and how will that compare with the 10gb 3080 and 24gb 3090? I know there are no definitive answers at the moment but it's interesting to see what others think here.,rtx_3000
so huge worry for me is the lack of vram im not sure if the gx6 vram is more efficient than gddrx5 or not but 10gb of vram on these new cards doesn't seem like enough given 4k games can already utilize 10+ it doesnt seem very future proof can someone confirm weither or not the new gx6 is different when it comes to usage !??!?!!?!?!?! Especially with this new tech that runs 4K a lot better devs will be pushing games further and eating up that 10g easily I don’t think I’ll buy if that’s the case what do u think ??,rtx_3000
"So will there be a 3080ti? Look at that gap between 3080 and 3090.... Surely many gamers don't need anywhere near 24gb of vram. I don't see how Nvidia wouldn't do a 3080ti, give it 12gbvram, price it in-between 3080/3090 and then be like but wait, the 3080ti is slightly faster than the 3090.

"So i have a EVGA 550G2 power supply for my 1060, and i plan on upgrading to the 3070... Would i have to buy a new power supply? Also, would i need to upgrade my Ryzen 5 1500X 3.5 to not be bottle necking?",rtx_3000

&#x200B;

I am asking here because i dont want to flood the subreddit with my questions

&#x200B;

so basically here i have a 1080p 144 hz monitor with gsync, fine, now that can always be upgraded in the future (i have 3 screen so if i want to play on some games with 3 id like something that can run most game at minina 60fps on 3 screen )

&#x200B;

so since i dont want to change my config every 2 years here is my config :

msi gtx 1080 gaming X

i7 8700k 3,7 ghz

 Z370 GAMING PLUS 

16 giga ram

i have 650W for the alimentation, i guess thats not enough ?

now my question is : since i dont want to change it fors years, is the 3090 worth to take if i want to sit on a good graphic card (and so config) for years and upgrade other things ? also what should i change expect the graphic card ? (for the pc case that can always be changed no problem of course)

or can the 3080 do the jobs for years to come ?

"I told people for a long time NOT to buy a 2080ti, 2080, 2070, and here we are. Those cards are obsoleted. We are seeing a better generational leap than than Pascal. And for reasonable prices. Sure, AMD might have something waiting in the wings, but if they remain silent, tough for them, people will snatch up the 30-series and they will lose sales. I do expect ""leaks"" but maybe we'll see an answer from them. But tick tick tick, thats the sound of AMD sales fading away. They don't respond, f-em.

rumor has it that AMD is unveiling their big navi tomorrow and i was wondering on your thoughts if Nvidia would lower their price for the 3070/3080 if AMD were to be competitive against them in the mid/high tier market. the community is loving the prices of the 3070/3080 and it will take a lot for people to switch over to team red when you consider that nvidia also has superior hardware and software. like what if AMD's flagship was as fast as a 3080 and they wanted to do nvidia dirty by selling it at $499? any likelyhood that nvidia would drop the 3080 down to $599 in this scenario?,rtx_3000

10gb!? On the “flag ship card” wtf is this shit.,rtx_3000
"Maybe it's because I'm not willing to sell a kidney for a GPU but I'm honestly not that impressed. While they advertised some killer specs here, I focused on the actual performance chart. 

While the 3080 looks like a monster that's, idk, 60-70% better than its predecessor, the 3070 only is getting 2080 ti performance. I say ""only"" because it's, well, 35-40% difference both on their charts and looking at external benchmarks looking at the 2070 super vs the 2080 ti. 

35-40% is about what turing offered over pascal for the price. 

I'd imagine the 3060 will only achieve 2080 superish performance. Another 35-40% boost. The 3050 will only reach 2070S levels of performance. While that would bring the $250ish card up to 190% of what my 1060 can do...that's not as insane as I hoped in 2 generations. And given the vram? I'm REALLY not that impressed. 6 GB probably on the 3050 or whatever, the same as my 1060....the 3070 having the same vram as the 1070, just faster. The 3080 being less than 1080 ti levels. 

I mean...what gives? I get it, we don't need more, but eventually they're just gonna turn around and double the vram, just you wait. First there was 512 MB cards, then 768MB and 1 GB cards a generation or two later. A generation or two after that, 2 GB cards, about 2 generations after that, 4 GB (well, 3.5...). The next generation, they went up to 6-8. And it's kinda stayed there for 4 years now.

Idk. I mean, when I buy cards, I wanna buy ""that"" card. The 8800 GT. The 660. The 1060. You know. That card that changes everything and becomes ""the standard"" for the next 4 years or so in its price class. 

I'm just not convinced this is it. Heck, my 1060 is turning out to be like the new 660. The 760 was like 25% better and on par with the 670, similar to how the 1660 super is like a 1070. And now this is looking to be maxwell. Maxwell was an amazing deal if you were a high end buyer. Like if you got a 970 or 980, it was great. But if I were in the market, odds are I'd get a 960. And the 960 was trash. It was like 15% better than the 760, and still had 2 GB VRAM. Then the 1060 was almost twice as good in a single generation.

If we were seeing say, a 12 GB card 75% better than the 1660 super, I'd HIGHLY consider upgrading. But if I had to interpolate based on the early performance charts and tiers for the lower end lineup, I'm guessing this is gonna be an incremental boost. This might be an insane series if you're looking to get a 3080 or something. But seeing how I'm in that $200-300 price range for a new GPU...I'm gonna guess this is gonna be a pass and I'm gonna be riding the 1060 for a few more years. I mean, it'll hold up. Games are only now starting to name it the minimum requirement and it has that ""standard"" 6 GB frame buffer that isn't going obsolete any time in the near future apparently. And I doubt they're gonna start requiring RTX features yet. Meh.

"I just bought a laptop with a RTX 2070, this release literally just fucked me over. I spent 1,300 on a RTX 2070 laptop with a Core i7 10750H. For 1300 its a great price because I cannot find anything cheaper that has the same specs that I would like in my own gaming laptop. The price vs performance in this card is blowing my mind. The reason I am mad/sad but hopeful about this new release is that the next generation of my card (3070) is 500$ yet it is MORE POWERFUL than the 2080ti flagship card. So basically what Nvidia is saying is that. ""Hey Kane, if you would've waited 6 months you coulda got the same laptop for 400 bucks cheaper that has a card more powerful than the 2080ti. Gosh makes me want to break my laptop in half. And shit I coulda paid the same 1300 dollars in the future for a 2080ti level card with better other specs compensating for the cheaper card.

Which means it's probably smarter to just save the additional 800$ a 3090 would cost so one can invest these two years later into a 4080 or whatever instead.,rtx_3000

This is WRONG.

It literally says relative performance and shows Pascal cards in the proper spots relative to their Turing counterparts on the same graph (look at the 2070 Super and the 1080 Ti being the same performance).

"Do you have a source for that statement that the 3070 is more powerful than the 2080TI only when RTX and DLSS enabled, or are you just assuming that? The slide shown during the presentation when Jenson makes that statement says “average performance across multiple popular graphics intensive games at 4K, I9 CPU”. I don’t think we can just assume that RTX and DLSS were on for all games in the comparison (I’m sure it was for some). Additionally if you look on NVIDIAs website they give some FPS comparisons for a few games between the 3070 and 2070. In borderlands 3 with RTX OFF @1440p Ultra (only title they show with RTX OFF) the 3070 looks like it’s gets 1.6x the FPS of the 2070 (80FPS vs 50FPS). The 2080TI is ~1.5x more powerful than the 2070. A quick search also shows the 2080TI gets around 75-80FPS at 1440p Ultra. So yeah at least for borderlands 3 it looks like the 3070 gets roughly the performance of the 2080Ti.

Obviously this is only one game and you are right that everyone should wait for 3rd party benchmarks before any final conclusions but I do think it’s pretty likely the 3070 will be roughly equal to the 2080TI in traditional rasterization and a step up in RTX which is pretty sweet for $500.",rtx_3000

Check out digitalfoundry early look. 3080 have around 80% more performance on non RT games. With RT it's up to 100%. Ridiculously good leap with nice pricing.  $700 3080 is damn godlike gpu. $500 3070 is better than $1200 2080 ti.,rtx_3000
"We have the DF video which showed relative performance with mostly RT OFF, not on. The 3080 was 60-100% faster than 2080. They specifically switch to RT testing later in the video and tested many games that literally don't even have RT. Doom Eternal for example reached 2x as fast as the 2080  (NOT 2080ti) at points.

This is of course 4K numbers, these numbers will undoubetdly be smaller at lower res. And ironically enough I think DLSS will SHRINK the performance gap rather than increase it, due to it essentially being lower resolution.

That explains why when DF switches to RT testing the performance gap is similar, because he also turned on DLSS.  I think DLSS OFF + RT ON will show the biggest difference but of course that's kind of not that relevant because nobody in their right mind turns on RT and not DLSS when DLSS is an option.",rtx_3000

Nice find. Myself and a lot of other people were sorta panicking wondering if we need to upgrade our PSU. I have a i7 6700k and hopefully I can keep my 650w PSU for the 3080.,rtx_3000
"Was also curious about that.

Have an i7-8700k with a 650w psu. 

EVGA has a wattage calculator and it said with my setup and an overclock on the cpu, I was drawing 601w. 

I'm not sure if having an OC CPU will factor in, but I might need to upgrade the PSU.",rtx_3000
"Yeah, I was skeptical about the requirement of a 750 watt PSU for the 3080. My ITX build has a 650 watt driving a 3900x and an RTX 2070 Super and it only pulls 350 watts from the wall. Even if the PC sans GPU is consuming 200 watts of that (and I doubt that it is), 650 watts should be plenty for the 3080 and below.",rtx_3000
"Thanks for that link. Was looking for more info about this and couldn't find it.

I'm gonna go ahead and go 3080 ahead of Cyberpunk and upgrade to 3080ti if it's good enough to justify.,rtx_3000
I'm thinking the same.  If the 3080Ti is out by early next year it's not too bad but it could be a whole 12 months.,rtx_3000
"I keep hearing that they won't do a Ti model this year.. but that doesn't mean they won't do a SUPER! 

I'll probably wait until the new AMD cards at LEAST to see how they compete. If I have to I'll wait a year and see if a Super (or Ti) gets announced.

But yeah, the whole Ti (Super) thing really makes it hard to jump in when they announce things. Probably why they want to discontinue that.",rtx_3000

"It also has higher bandwidth. That might make a difference. It's not really a gaming card anyway, that enormous VRAM is more appealing to scientists.",rtx_3000
its got 24 GB of vram... do people not realize that people use their graphics cards for tasks other than gaming? if its too expensive for you then don't buy it. reading comments about price to performance is so goddamn tiring. you just got a reveal that says you can get 2080Ti-like performance from a 3070 for $500.. wtf are you complaining about?,rtx_3000
"The 3090 is going to be killer value for deep learning training. Earlier the titan used to be the only option due to the 24GB VRAM, but now you can go with the 3090, get loads of extra performance compared to RTX Titan (3x higher tensor core throughput) at $1500 v/s $2500 last generation.

If you're just going to game, there's absolutely no reason to get the 3090 unless you're a baller. Besides, there's likely going to be a 3080 ti with 95% 3090 performance but 12GB VRAM in a few months if you want the top of the line gaming.",rtx_3000
"Thats extremely good. Consider the cost to value of the Titan RTX to 2080Ti, only sightly more than double the VRAM for 1300 more. My workstation rig just devalued by more than 2K automatically (its fine, I'll upgrade anyways) with this announcement, but on the brightside it means I can upgrade both cards for 500 over the price of one of their predecessors. Flipping them however is pretty much pointless now, and I'd imagine many late 20s series owners are shitting themselves with rage right now.",rtx_3000
"Slightly lower clock speeds though, so probably sub-20%.",rtx_3000
"If you take the 2x 2080 at face value( Hint:don't) it would be something like 1.5-1.6x better. the 3090 has 20% more cuda cores. Usually that doesn't scale linearly and also doesn't factor in boost clocks.

If I'm being conservative I'd say the 3080 is 40-50% better than a 2080 ti and a 3090 will be 45-55% better than a 2080 ti without including DLSS/RTX features.

"Well, yes and no. Games will probably still start budgeting CPU resources based on the Zen 2 CPUs on the consoles, so while storage decompression won't be the bottleneck (And also LOD because of mesh shaders), developers will probably pump up other CPU intensive aspects of their games to utilize that extra unused power, meaning a 4 core or 8 thread CPU might still be a bottleneck depending on the game.

We'll know for sure once games actually utilize these technologies.",rtx_3000

For the type of person who has to have the best however, you can justify any price tag really.

It's actually a lot cheaper than previous gen titans, but the reason the price jump between the highest model and this one might seem higher than the previous jumps between top models and titans is because this gen's flagship (the 3080) is being priced much more aggressively.",rtx_3000

When you raise the resolution or supersample or whatever, you make it so the load is on your GPU more, so it might go up to 100% usage even though your CPU is still maxed out.

Its 24GB of GDDR6X memory can tackle the toughest AI algorithms and feed massive, content creation workloads. The RTX 3090 is up to 50 percent faster than the current ultimate PC graphics card, TITAN RTX, enabling gamers to experience 60 fps in 8K resolution across many top games.

Yeah, it's definitely not going to be 50% faster than the 3080. It's barely 50% faster than the TITAN RTX.",rtx_3000
[deleted],rtx_3000
Yes,rtx_3000
yeah VRAM kills me on the 3080 had it had 12GB it been a done deal even at 800 bucks. i think they backed down the ram to keep the price at 700. there are rumors of a 20GB 3080 which i would jump on at 900 to 1000 US,rtx_3000

They just keep the same price until stock runs out.,rtx_3000
The adapter takes 2 8 pin connectors and converts it to 1 12 pin. So if you already have 2 8 pins running to your card it shouldn't be that big of a deal.,rtx_3000
There was no improvement.  It is same generatio as Turing. Nvdec has been upgraded but not sure what. May only be av1 decode,rtx_3000

a 2080 TI bottlenecks a 3600x around about 2.5% average at 1440p and about .75% average around 1080p. So you can safely assume your bottle neck wont be more than 8% MAX on the more demanding programs on 1440 and no more than around 5% at 1080p on most programs. This bottleneck also might not start to come out for a atleast a year or two as newer games will create more demand.,rtx_3000
"NVidia is using this generation to introduce a new,  smaller, 12-pin, power connector for their graphics cards. However, no power supply currently has cables supporting that connector.

If you want a card with more VRAM then it's worth waiting, if you like the look of the real world performance of the cards currently on offer then it's worth getting one.

If your PSU is modular, check if there are extra 8pin outputs that aren't currently populated - the PSU should have come with enough cables to fill all the outputs, or, if your system was a prebuilt, the manufacturer should have sent along all the extra cables.

The lone benefit of which being that you could use it with other laptops or future GPUs if you ever upgrade.",rtx_3000

There will undoubtedly be a Ti within the year. The gap between the 3080 and 3090 leaves quite a bit of wiggle room to drop one in and maybe even do the same for the lower tiers. Ditching the Super and going with the Ti.,rtx_3000

"> Is there a dual 6 pin to 8 pin adaptor

Yes, they used to be very common when the 8-pin connector first came out and were often included with GPUs of that time. They're compatible with any PSU with 6-pins.

Unfortunately they've become rare as of late, here's one example:

https://www.amazon.com/BLUEXIN-6-Pin-Female-Adapter-0-65ft/dp/B07FNBFFXT",rtx_3000
No you'd be hard pressed to find a game a 9900K would be a bottleneck in.,rtx_3000
"You can run into hitching/stuttering issues when the card doesn't supply the amount of VRAM being demanded, like back when it came out that the 970 actually had 3.5GB and not the advertised 4GB VRAM, so people were able to display performance issues when the game tried to draw over 3.5.

However, the meters used in games on the graphics options menu to show how much VRAM is needed are often wildly inaccurate. I remember running Resident Evil 2 fully maxed at 1440p outstripped the 11GB VRAM on my 2080ti according to the main menu but I never had any issues. The generational leap from GDDR6 to to GDDR6X is akin to the one from GDDR5 to GDDR6. We can expect this new memory to make up for any shortcomings in the total amount (which will likely be enough for most all scenarios up to 4K anyway).

There's a quote from Nvidia somewhere where they have ongoing discussions with game developers and thoroughly test the VRAM requirements for the biggest and most demanding titles, and they all pretty much fell in the 4-6GB range, so in order to keep the cost down (as adding more VRAM inevitably increases the cost to consumer of the card) they chose what they felt was an adequate sweet spot. No one can say for sure if it'll be enough, but I'd say there's a good chance it'll be fine.",rtx_3000
There is a very small percentage of people buying a 3090 so if you plan on getting it the second its available you are probably good to go,rtx_3000

"Founders editions have usually been on the lower end for thermals and noise, they work fine and will run the card as it's supposed to if just a little hot or noisy. Some generations were pretty good, I had a FE 980 and it ran cool thanks to the 900 series being cooler than the 600 series I came from, it was always quiet to the point I never noticed it. 2000 series FE cards were noticeably hot, and noisy because of the heat, given that it was a hot generation of cards.

However this time around Nvidia seem to have done a stellar job on the cooling options, with the 3080 said to run ""20C cooler"" than the 2080 FE, which puts it in the 60C ballpark, and the 3090 running 30C cooler than the RTX Titan, putting it in the 50C ballpark. This is all while being supposedly quieter, so we can guess the cooling is efficient enough for the fans not to need an aggressive curve. Essentially then, if this is true you can expect the FE cards to run at low fan speeds and keep the cards cool, making them a safe investment. I personally really dig the FE variant, so I'll be getting one for sure. I went AIB for the 600 series, FE for the 900, AIB for 1000 and aib for 2000 series, now I'll be back on the FE variant.",rtx_3000

However they blew people's expectations away, and I love it, because it's a slap in the face to the people that were complaining non stop about how Nvidia is selling cards at over $1000, regardless of how good those cards were. 

For example, the $1299 2080 Ti was a ridiculous bump in performance over the 2080 and 2080 Super, when you compare the performance of the 2070 and 2070 Super. But people didn't care because ""ERMAHGERD, IT'S OVER PROVED, WAAAA.""

"> I didn't expect them to make the 3090 more expensive than anticipated either.

i wasnt ether but also its only $100, which yeah that IS a lot of money. but when you are already spending well over 10x that on one card 100 bucks more isnt that big a deal. now the 3080 and 3070 being so cheap IS surprising.",rtx_3000

"Everyone is saying RIP AMD but the pricing of the 3000 series might just be an indication that AMD has something decent coming up. Nvidia are freezing prices either because the 2xxx didn't sell or because AMD are becoming competitive again, not out of the kindness of their hearts.

The cat guy on Twitter who leaked everything accurately says Big Navi will match the 3080, lets wait and see.",rtx_3000
">something really spectacular out of their ass.

they could be 2x as strong and 100 cheaper if their drivers still randomly have software / hardware issues I wont buy them.",rtx_3000
I'm not sure. I'm guessing Nvidia got a really good deal from Samsung with the 8nm node. AMD likely gonna pick one of the TSMC 7nm nodes. And Big Navi obviously will be big. So it would be quite hard to undercut Nvidia this time.,rtx_3000
"Considering that the next gen consoles will have AMDs in them, I'm sure they will do fine even if they only release mid range PC cards.  Just by looking at the consoles, they'll have something decent but likely won't topple the 3080",rtx_3000
[Hmmm](https://twitter.com/sherkelman/status/1300842481886662658),rtx_3000
If you’re wondering whey the price to performance is suddenly so amazing. It’s not because Nvidia is going above and beyond. It’s because their competition is bringing some horsepower and they have to compete. So yes. RNDA 2 will be powerful.,rtx_3000
"if you're familiar with Nvidia's pricing history, then you would likely conclude that pressure from AMD is why the release prices are so low.  who else would be able to apply market pressure pushing NV's prices downwards",rtx_3000
Yeah console hardware literally has zero margins too. You think selling a $500 Xbox with their giant SOC affords them any profit? Even if Xbox sells them at like a $200 loss AMD will probably make like a dollar or two per unit.,rtx_3000

Haven't fully gone through these just yet but at a glance it looks like a pretty significant jump from the 20 series (70%+!!!), even without ray tracing. That's seriously impressive",rtx_3000

"Yea here is the chart: https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/nvidia-generational-leap-100856288-orig.jpg

No mention of DLSS or RT and the Pascal cards are on it.",rtx_3000
"It's possible. If it's 5-10% slower than a 2080 Ti that would still be a huge leap in performance for the price, which would be a great thing for consumers",rtx_3000
"Ray tracing basically murdered performance on a 2080 Ti, especially in the early days. You'd have games struggle to reach 60 FPS at 1080p, when the card should have easily been able to reach 100+ FPS at 1440p. DLSS helped a bit but there was still a noticeable hit to performance.

This new generation of cards has much, much better ray tracing performance, so it could feasibly reduce or even eliminate the performance hit that the 20 series experienced, in which case a 3070 could outperform a 2080 Ti in the same game with the same settings and with ray tracing on. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the 3070 would outperform a 2080 Ti in a game where ray tracing isn't supported, say for example in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which could reach 110+ FPS at 1440p with almost everything maxed out.",rtx_3000
"It's possible. Simply looking at CUDA cores, 3070 has 5888 versus 4352 in 2080 Ti. That's already a 35% increase. This will improve games that are limited by shader performance (per-pixel shading heavy), but there's still raster engines, texture units, and ROPs to consider too.

Generally, there should be a 15-25% uplift over 2080 Ti, on average. It can approach 50% in very optimized games (driver+engine optimizations). Nvidia usually improves memory and cache compression every generation, so memory bandwidth might not be too limiting (except in ray tracing without DLSS). It's a 20% reduction from 2080 Ti (616GB/s to 512GB/s in 3070), so in areas where compression isn't effective, Nvidia will need to rely on variable rate shading or other tricks.

It's still best to verify manufacturer claims with independent benchmarks.",rtx_3000

They said check back the 17th for availability on the 3080.,rtx_3000
"Yeah I see a shit ton of 2080s on the shelf so I assume general GPU availability has gotten reasonable again.  They're aware that demand will be high, so hopefully they've prepared for Apple-level distribution.  (I know I'm wishing)",rtx_3000
Is it like sellout in 5 minutes or 30 seconds? First card here and I’m dead after that 3080. I’m running on a 1050ti that my neighbor borrowed me for a few weeks.,rtx_3000
Oke thanks for the info bud!,rtx_3000
"I just did the math on my SF600 running on a 3950X and 1080. Current system maximum load draw is 320W, removing the 1080 takes off 180W and add in 320W of the 3080, that gives me a total running wattage of 460W, that means we still have 140W of headroom to work with. We should be a-ok.",rtx_3000
Youll be fine i think according to the redditor that replied on my comment,rtx_3000
"Good move, considering the 2080ti value basically dropped off a cliff after this reveal.",rtx_3000

Yep I have 2 8-pins. Very happy to hear this! Thankyou.,rtx_3000
Yeah this one got sold for 500 https://www.ebay.com/itm/EVGA-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-2080-Ti-Graphics-Card-Black-Edition-/264850727833,rtx_3000
I was planning to buy a monitor to go with the GPU,rtx_3000
"My wallet: ""Fuck""

I've got 2x 32in 1440p 165hz monitors. 2080S is getting only like 120 in FF14.",rtx_3000
Ok. That’s comforting.,rtx_3000
Not with a vertical GPU mount that is 2 slot. 159mm of horizontal clearance. I'm thinking the 3090 is gonna be a tight fit for a lot of us.,rtx_3000
"Nvidia marketing don't want us knowing actual FPS figures. 4K Ultra games going from 22fps to 38fps, OMG 180% gain in performance!!",rtx_3000
Interesting how they don't want anyone comparing the 2080ti. I suspect because the difference between the 2080ti and 3080 isn't that great unless you enable RTX.,rtx_3000
I got a free $100 psu I am selling so I'm fine,rtx_3000
"Lol, I forgot how costly is a 2080. And for 300 euros, it's better to directly buy 3000. 
GG Nvidia",rtx_3000
"Oeh, and what you think for half year old 2070? Bought it beginning of summer for 400, will have huge loss I assume :/",rtx_3000
Fixed. I'm a moron. That's what I get for spam refreshing their site.,rtx_3000
Just refreshed now. I'm an idiot.,rtx_3000
"It'll be their top of the line hybrid card, as per last generation. There's an AIO cooler that covers the die while a heatsink and fan cover the VRM.

Doesn't really answer my question.,rtx_3000
So they counted in nonfunctional transistors just for marketing ?,rtx_3000
Dang it. I just put braided cables into my system. Hopefully they make some soon. Thank you for the response!,rtx_3000
"nah im using a r5 3600 and the psu is from thermaltake and 80+.
i guess im super fine then, thanks",rtx_3000
"Oh okay. Thanks, I didn’t realize there was usually such a delay. Last gen my first time building a pc.",rtx_3000
Gotcha alright thanks.,rtx_3000
"Great thank you, hopefully can snag one lol",rtx_3000
Just checked mine and I have until Sept 10 hopefully we can get some reviews by then,rtx_3000
"Jesus, going to need my gigabit connection to carry me to the promise land.",rtx_3000
"Yeah, I’m coming from a 980Ti. Was never going to upgrade to the next gen, and the 20s obviously proved to be a let down. 

I can’t decide if I’ll go for the 3080 on release or wait for the Ti. It’s reasonable to assume we will get a Ti, but when, and for how much, and at what performance gain, we still don’t know. 

If you’re on a 10 series, then the answer is a lot simpler for you since than 1080Ti is a beast and waiting a little longer won’t be an issue, but for people like me on a 980Ti, it’s a though one.",rtx_3000
Is there a projected time when these would be one mass produced and two be more available for us,rtx_3000
I'm worried about not being quick enough to buy it when it releases. Then that would basically mean months without a gpu,rtx_3000
"Mine is GIGABYTE unfortunately. But after talking to some people regarding what kind of games I play, they don't think upgrading is a need at the moment",rtx_3000
Thanks for the quick response!,rtx_3000
"Thank you for the reply, NVIDIA will probably release more benchmarks and tests in the coming days though about the new series.",rtx_3000
"That's what I meant by slight premium. I myself sold my 2080ti for barely $700 yesterday. Perhaps with zero stock of 3070/80 someone may have been willing to buy my 2080 Ti for a slight premium (given new price baselines, not old ones) for about $750+

The only reason I'm talking about crashes was the nightmare that was all of the major supermarket store websites in the UK crashing (even when I was 2 seconds from confirming an order) during the first quarter of the lockdown.

Honestly though, selling out in a few hours? That's practically centuries! Although I'm concerned that this timing is based on the previous few generations unattractive price to performance ratios. In conjunction with big Rona, I'm worried the on hand stock won't be able to tank the excitement from the horde.

Would be nice if Nvidia gave us some assurances around their on hand stock. I can already smell the scalpers getting ready to buy like 10 3080s and sell it for almost double price online. I believe companies have yet to find a proper solution to these scoundrels when it comes to their more attractive products. That being said Palit seemed to have hinted to me in an email correspondence that they may have preorders open with some of their retailers. It's not public info, so it could be a way to go forth and avoid scalpers. I'll have to research the difference between Palit and FE.",rtx_3000
"Curious, why did you end up cancelling it?",rtx_3000
2K.  2560 x 1440 specifically.,rtx_3000
"My cables will probably be mashed up against the glass then I would assume, yeah?",rtx_3000
Once next gen kicks in I don't see 10gb not being an issue. This is a card I want for 4 to 5 years,rtx_3000
Thanks I think I'll go for the 3080 then.,rtx_3000
I mean... even SATA will work. Just more slowly. The main advantage to RTX IO is it takes the decompression workload off the CPU.,rtx_3000
Guess I'll wait and buy them together. Surely a Samsung 970 as popular as it is will be good,rtx_3000
"Oh dang so 970 no good. Yeah I have the b550m tuf, says its 4.0",rtx_3000
"I was thinking that too, or they have a $1200 or so ti/super 3080 ready to counter AMD.

Such a pain, I really think VRAM is holding me back with 3080. I have seen horizon use 10.5

I really think I am best off waiting until late nov. and seeing where everything is. Hopefully amd has something between a 80 - 90 with like 16gb VRAM.",rtx_3000

Probably 2 max,rtx_3000
"alrighty, thanks!",rtx_3000
"Thanks for the reply. In all honesty I was being serious with the 9700k. I know the new 10th gen came out, not that I would upgrade since I built this pc a year and a half ago. I’m more or less attempting to future proof. I love my cpu I got it to 5.4 on water. I waited on the gpu when building because I didn’t like what was available. My current setup is  Aorus Pro z390 9700k and hopefully the 3080 will be a nice fit. Thanks for your help!! Also with the 3080 and a monitor, I currently have the zowie but will the 3080 do 8k? What about 300hz stuff!?",rtx_3000
"I have an MSI x570 MPG Gaming Carbon Wifi - it's the only one that allows this many PCI-E lanes for the hyper m.2 card and the GPU. (6 Total NVME drives and the GPU.) I wanted the 3090 as I want to eventually get a high refresh rate monitor once they come down in price. I have a 32"" 4K 60Hz screen now and the 3090 seems quite the future proof card even tho it's expensive. Also my 1080 Ti has 12GB of ram and the 3080 has 10gb so that's somewhat of a downgrade VRAM wise....",rtx_3000
"So staying on my Old board should be fine and maybe just upgrade the CPU?

That was the only thing to worry about, since with 3080 would require an new Mainboard etc. but if I can stay on PCI 3.0 for the lifetime in gaming, might be alright then :)",rtx_3000

yeah but also cyberpunk lol i dont think ill have a great experience with my 1080 ....,rtx_3000
Also a very good argument but i basically saves for about a year for this month . It’s a tough decision.,rtx_3000
I posted what I’m doing below lol basically evga 3080 and I’ll step up or sell it to get the 3080super/ti . Use extra money fo zen 3 and more sdds,rtx_3000

I mean both. High refresh isn't achievable with high resolutions,rtx_3000

"Perf/$ wise it is good. The naming scheme is one too high tho, 3070 should be named 3080, 3080 -> 3080ti and 3090 -> Titan. On the other hand that would make the vram amounts hilariously low",rtx_3000

Wonder when the dimensions of the EVGA cards will be out. Really curious if any of 3080 models will fit in my case,rtx_3000
My favorite of those posts are people who have AMD 3700x's asking if their CPU will bottleneck them. I've seen it several times here and in other places as well.,rtx_3000
There was no NVlink connector on the 3080 so no SLI.,rtx_3000
I think I'll just buy a 3090 I'm a little to excited,rtx_3000
"Honestly that would be the better deal and 2 3080s should trounce the 3090 in everything but memory requirements.

If only DX12 would finally stack memory in multi gpu setups instead of mirroring them like they have forever.

Should also note sli support has been waning a ton over the past 5 years so don't expect much support. Always better to go with one powerful card over 2.",rtx_3000

But you had a good run. The 3080 will be my first high end card. Love to see what my 3900x can do at 1440p ultra.,rtx_3000

Hopefully being under by 50 watts isn’t a big deal once the benchmarks come out. I’m in no hurry to buy at least. This is gonna be my one big upgrade on my 9 month old Ryzen 7 2700x on b450 board system and hopefully run it into the ground over 6-7 years of use",rtx_3000

"This isn't exactly accurate.

Base clock speed means nothing with AIB cards. Clock speeds and memory speeds can be changed in the BIOS through programs like MSI Afterburner. What AIB cards really have going for them is the max power draw. For example, while the 3090 FE sits at 375 Watts, the EVGA FTW3 is rumored to get at least 450 watts, allowing the chip to hit *much* higher boosts/static clocks.

FE Cards will certainly have the best average of good binned chips. AIB companies stockpile the best binned chips to use in their ultra-premium lines, which aren't being released until months after the initial FE releases.",rtx_3000

The 3070 is the only card which had a price cut. 3080 launch price is same as 2080. And you're straight up naive if you think there won't still be a Titan in the $2000 range. They'd be out of their minds to cut the Titan price when commercial accounts were eating them up like candy at the higher prices. This is a 2080ti replacement no matter what line of bullshit they try to sell you.,rtx_3000

There's just no way they can ever meet the demand during a launch window. Even more so at these price points for the 3070 and 3080. Man those things are gonna be hard to get until after Christmas.,rtx_3000
I wouldn’t worry. The website will collapse on the day(s) of launch and by the time it becomes available again all of the cards will be sold out.,rtx_3000

"Did customers really think that R&D and massive technological advancements will unironically cost the same gen to gen forever?

Yeah 499 is a great price for a """"""""""""""""""""""""""medium"""""""""""""""""""" graphics card. A medium graphics card which btw, outperforms the former 1200$ that was considered the best GPU today. If you're delusional enough to consider it as being a rip off or a bad price when it can do so much, well, it's on you.

Add in iPhone to show how top end electronic products’ prices grow. 

So basically are saying that $499 is not a good price for a card that is slightly better than the best card released 2 years ago, no matter how expensive and how good that card is.

I doubt that any game would be using 10G of textures/vertex data on any single frame, even with 200G of game data that would be 5% of all game assets and that's bloody unlikely.

"They have 12, I believe 4gb is dedicated to OS or something",rtx_3000
Maybe but Series X can only use 12.5GB for games and remember it's not all vram plus consoles target 4k most of the time so 1440p and 1080p gamers should have no issues. More vram is better but in reality no one buys a 3080/70 and uses it for 7 years.

Nvidia announcing the amazing prices on the 3070 and 3080 is going to force the retailers to either severely drop the prices of the 2000 series cards, or drop them by a smaller margin just below the 3000 to try and sell out their stock.

Haha no thankfully that's not the case. I bought it at launch so it's two years old. I'm just a bit butt hurt that it's now depreciated so much. I guess it's all relative though.,rtx_3000

Basically, in this test the 3080 has the same RT performance as a hypothetical Turing RTX 2090 that is 80% faster than the 2080Ti. Or am I missing something?

I bought mine April/May.  I’m happy with it since it was mostly just intended to be a placeholder.  I’d have felt particularly stupid if I had gone with the 2080 TI though,rtx_3000
"It certainly is a less stressful option to go 3090 but only if you have enough money so that neither option really matter. 3080 > sell > 3080 Ti will probably be just around the same money as a 3090, as you point out.

However, if you don't have enough money where it doesn't even matter then I can see why 3080 > 3080 Ti makes sense. Buying the 3090 is a big upfront payment, but the 3080 is much easier for many people to pay for. Then if a 3080 Ti shows up in for example a year they have had a lot of time to save up money after their 3080 purchase.

It's generally easier for most peoples economy to pay a little bit at a time rather than a big amount all at once. But if you have a nice saving that you can just take 1499 USD away from without a problem the two reasonable ways is either 3090 or all together wait for the 3080 Ti.",rtx_3000

"This is true, but I have a hunch that they will be close to $999 because the 3090 is basically a Titan(1kish less than turing).

Forgot to add that I do want to stream as well.,rtx_3000
"I mean, I don't agree with that either, but maybe.

On the end though, as a consumer, what really matters is performance per dollar under reasonable levels of temperature and wattage so you don't have spend a ton of money on PSU.

It's also a lot to with the semiconductor manufacturers. Nvidia can't really do much to reduce the power on this node, and TSMC don't have capacity to manufacture for all companies out there. TSMC also most likely charge a ton of more money than Samsung did, because Samsung will gain more from just having Nvidia as possible longterm partners rather than charging a lot for their 8nm node.

Doubt we would have had 700 dollar 3080 if it was TSMC is what I'm trying to say. And I would rather have some more power usage for reasonable price than lower power for higher price",rtx_3000
"But you won't really get as much performance as a 3080 by simply cranking the 1080 to 320W and cooling it, if it even manages to reach that target. Perf/Watt improvements are there, just not as much as they used to be.",rtx_3000

Yeah its alot of money and price/perf isnt the best but these higher end cards hold there value pretty well as I can attest. I do need to upgrade CPU though. My PC is on a 4790k still. I was given a system76 adder ws laptop with 2070 super and i7 10750h which is working really well until the 3090 and new guts come.,rtx_3000
"Yeah I'm in the same boat. I figure the 3700x is 50W less than the i9-10900K. They also recommend 750W for the 3090 which uses 30W more than the 3080, so between that I think we should be fine.

Another way of looking at it is the TGP for the 3080 is 320W and there's no way the rest of my system is getting anywhere close to using 300W even under peak load, counting CPU, MB, fans, etc.",rtx_3000
"That's probably the one I was talking about. Thing is, there's people that have a bid of 1000+ that ends in a few days. I may just hang on to my 2080ti and just buy a 3080 once evga comes out with theirs.

That is a tough one man. I feel for you there.",rtx_3000
"thats a very likely scenario. It could be worth returning, snatching up a cheap 1080 or 2070/2080 that everyone is unloading for cheap right now, getting the 3070 whenever you can, then reselling the used card for whatever you can get for it.

"Touching, but not squished. You still have the better part of an inch for them, and thanks to the 12 pin connector it would point the cables backwards instead just have them jutting out horizontally.

The AIB 3090s aren't as wide if you wanted to try looking at those, they shave off another 10 - 20mm. But you might be stuck with normal facing 8pin connectors, which would be even worse with such a small space.",rtx_3000
"Well, that's up to you.

It's nothing I'm personally concerned about. Less competition on launch day for me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",rtx_3000
"It's not that the 970 is no good, nvmes are already astronomically fast with the 970 coming in at 3500mb/s, hugely ahead of m2 sata ssds which are closer to 500mb/s. Both however are much faster than mechanical drives, and RTX IO can likely utilize either for much faster than speeds we're used to.

Pcie4 however is not an insignificant jump, with speeds around 7000mb/s, making it worthwhile if rtx IO can use it.",rtx_3000
"Huh, that's a kinda weird thing to say. Nvidia have been pretty clear on the 17th so I don't think they'd make people who are preparing for the 17th very happy if they surprise released earlier. With due notice of course I'm sure we'd all be happy to get it a few days earlier though!",rtx_3000
"I just did a rough calculation, using 2080ti stats and an incredibly generous 46% increase, rdr2 will be above 144 on medium. To be fair rdr2 is one of the most difficult games to run on most benchmarks and with dlss support most likely high will be fine. Beast of a card.",rtx_3000
"I stand corrected then! Could be a possibility then, with Cold War launching around November.",rtx_3000

"It's not totally unwarranted. AMD's target for RDNA2 was always 50% more performance per watt.
So even without changing anything else, at the same power draw, the card would be at least 50% better than a 5700xt at the same 225 watt power tdp. [The most recent rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-big_navi-rdna2-all-we-know) also suggest the card is literally going to have double the shaders/compute units as the 5700xt did. The 5700xt had 40 CUs in it; the Xbox Series X is already revealed to have 52 CUs. [According to this, though I don't know how correct,](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/xbox-series-x-gpu.c3482) the expexted power consumption for the XSX is 200 Watts. I believe that includes the processor as well, but on paper this GPU already beats the 5700xt by more than 20%. AMD's claims as well was that at 33% less power draw, RDNA2 (at around 160w) would match RDNA1's performance.


I totally agree that you don't just get 100% gains like that. I'm not an AMD fanboy either, just a tech fanboy, but things are definitely looking positive for them. 2 weeks ago when Nvidia revealed their 3080 I was literally sitting here going ""There's no way AMD can compete with this,"" but with the traditional rendering benchmarks showing a performance improvement over the 2080ti of only 25~30%, I think AMD can totally compete with this.

Could work. I see no harm in just trying. Worst that can happen is that the PC shuts down under load. Then you know you need a more thicc PSU.,rtx_3000
"The FE card is looking like a strict 2 slot card probably about 45mm thick. It gives the h210i about 10 to 15mm clearance to get some air. The worrying part will be the pull fan and heatsink sitting over the NZXT metal band. 

It'll fit. But to to get ideal temps you may need an SFX PSU and to remove that metal strip. Either risk it or wait until another H210 owner gets one. The pull configuration should minimise any choking on the cut out side, I'd be worried about getting air to the core fan. This looks like the most discrete card design we'll get looking at all other AIO cards",rtx_3000

"Actually it seems the 1080ti and 2080 are pretty damn close, so you'll likely see the same/similar jump from a 1080ti to a 3080 as you would from a 2080 to a 3080, so about 70% on average in regular games. Obviously the big gain over the 1080ti will be the ability to use ray tracing now too, which is a huge bonus.",rtx_3000
"Yeah you're right, I only owned a regular 1080 and jumped to a 2080ti so I wasn't too sure how close it was to a 2080.

"Historically yes it's usually worth waiting, the FE variants perform quite radically different depending on each generation and how hot the chips were. This 2000 series was particularly hot, and the FE variant had a hard time keeping them cool and quiet, so they were noisy and a little hot.

This time around Nvidia seem to have balanced things well, with what they claim 20C less heat on the 3080 to the 2080 and 30C less heat on the 3090 to the RTX Titan. What that should mean is an FE 3080 running in the 60C ballpark, and an FE 3090 running in the 50C ballpark. Anecdotally they said things like ""10x quieter"", so we can assume their new cooler design allows for these temps at low fan speeds. FE seems a good bet this time around, if you can get one.",rtx_3000

"The Super was kind of the Ti for the 2060 and 2070 versions and a mini-Ti for the 2080.

The OC variants are usually just better binned and barely any better performance wise than the non-OC ones. You can tweak them more though and get better OC results, but the difference in a game is negligible in most cases.",rtx_3000

VRAM sits at barely half capacity too.

With the 3070 at least matching the 2080ti for performance, and the 3080 beating it, you'll have zero issues running these games like wet dreams. I can't soeak much for the Photoshop and Premier Pro side of things, but 10GB of GDDR6X seems like it would be more than enough for the job given current standards.",rtx_3000
"Just to put it into context, I had a 2600x and a 1080 ti. In many games using MSI afterburner that the GPU utilization wasn't hitting 100%. When I upgraded to a 2080 TI it was even worse.

"Correct. In theory, that should deliver enough power. 

However, it's *possible* you'll run into stability issues, especially if you're overclocking at all - there have been examples of people having unstable systems with a single daisy chained 2x8pin, then switching to 2 cables and having the stability issues vanish, without changing the PSU.

If that does happen to you, then you might consider upgrading to a PSU that has 3 spare PCIe power outs in addition to the CPU 8pin, but that's the kind of thing that you can't really predict.",rtx_3000

Zotac has some sleek looking cards in their Holo line-up, and iGame has a awesome looking closed loop card with radiator; but its only sleek compared to other partner cards.

Integrating the heat fins *into the fans* is a stroke of design genuis that no one else has approached yet with their cards.

I feel like if you’re buying a 3090 you’re either stupid rich (so $2500 for a titan doesn’t matter), or you need that crazy performance for work/business, which again you’re probably going to spend the extra $1000 for the best of the best.

Then for regular people, 3080 is $800 cheaper with absolutely insane power not far behind 3090.

So who would get a 3090? Like who spends $1500 on a GPU but wouldn’t spend the $2500 or so for the best thing.

30 watts hardly qualifies as ""headroom"", you should upgrade.

50 watts? a tad more reasonable.

70 - 100 watts? waaaay better.

>>But anyway, I would expect the top of the line to come at $1200 again, or $1500 bc the ""3090"" name is a bit sketchy - it sounds like they want to create a new price bracket.

>It seems to be coming true. 24GB would classify as a new performance bracket purely because it would allow prosumers to get into the card as long as they don't hamstring it in some fashion to make it not as good as a ""Titan"" for 3dfx and machine learning.

>As far as gaming goes, it still is the replacement for the 2080ti. Performance brackets are just arbitrary tiers. 2080ti is the top tier gaming card, as will be the 3090. Passing up the 12GB mark makes a lot of sense for this gen. Going to 24 seems like overkill, but maybe there is a good reason for that. If the 3080/ti comes in at 16GB, I'll solidly declare that this is a new performance tier, but sitting on 11/12GB VRAM for three gens in a row doesn't really make sense for a top tier gaming card.

>Anyway, if true, 24GB is a big deal either way. To classify it as another ""performance tier,"" you have to ask yourself if you would think that if it was named the 3080Ti. If a 3080 had 12GB and the 3080Ti had 16GB - would you consider the naming schema to be wrong? Not really. However, at 24GB that kind of becomes questionable. We're used to the XX80Ti cards being 1.5x VRAM of the next tier, we're not so used to them doubling it.

>The most logical conclusion is a 3080 @ 12GB, 3080Ti @ 16GB, and 3090 @ 24GB. That would IMO set it apart as a new ""performance"" tier - or a cheaper Titan.

>For some reason, I see this playing out where the 24GB card is still over $2K and is merely a rebranded Titan, with the $1500 card being the 3080Ti with (hopefully) 16GB, but possibly 12GB. Nvidia did surprise us pretty well with the 1080Ti though, so maybe.. we can hope.

So,  what is happening here, and the reason this argument is continuing is: Nvidia just released a 3080 and a Titan. They didn't release the 3080Ti. This essentially forces enthusiast early adopters to buy the 3090 when they *would not have otherwise*.

It seems like they did this as recently as the 10xx series, so it's not exactly new or out of the norm for them. Actually, I would consider this a *less* shady business tactic than what they did with the 10. With the 10, they released 1080.... then LATER released the Titan, and finally, even later, they released the 1080Ti which killed the Titan in price/perf. At least this way you should be able to buy the king of the gen right off the bat.

I haven't kept up with VR tech but if the 2080 Ti is enough then the 3070 will easily over power it since it has more than 1500+ Cuda core compared to 2080ti. The 3080 has more than 2500+ Cuda Cores than 2080Ti.,rtx_3000
I think its more about cost. Console's always has to be in a certain budget to appeal the most casual gamers.,rtx_3000
"cheaper, easier to design a cooling system for 1 chip. heck the switch uses an nvidia ""apu"" since it has the cpu and gpu on 1 chip too.

but honestly its also cheaper to put a mid range cpu and midrage cpu in one chip than to design a whole system around two mid range chips or one high and one mid/low range chip",rtx_3000

"Yeah, everyone here should be hoping for a serious reply from AMD - in fact, **I personally think** the fact that Nvidia thinks AMD might have a serious reply is a big reason why they pushed to have a 3070 priced where it is performing against a 2080ti.

Vega was a huge disappointment, Navi was a huge disappointment; but I could see a Big Navi flagship technically more powerful than the 3080 in theory, and performing slightly worse at most games because of software.  And I could see that performance pushing nvidia, which is great. 

Basing my theory off of unsubstantiated leaks and MS/Sony marketing claims - so who knows - could be wrong. But the Sony/MS marketing claims seem less improbable when compared against nvidia's new line than they did when compared against 2019 PC hardware.",rtx_3000

Just because it outperforms a top-tier card from *two years ago* doesn't make it top of the current range. That used to be *normal*. The difference is that now even the mid-tier cards are priced at what used to be at or near the top price point for cards 5 years ago.",rtx_3000

"No, you guys just don't understand the context. They are not charging less because they are nice, they are charging less because they are obviously expecting competition from AMD, which is news to the rest of us, and why its surprising. Its not surprising that its 'cheap', its surprising there is expected competition in the gpu market for the first time in years.",rtx_3000
Which one is the low range?,rtx_3000
I'd say a 3070 or a 2080Ti is high end and not really mid range tbh. Will be midrange in a couple of years maybe...,rtx_3000
This range of cards with similar jumps in performance were in the $300s up until 2018 so I'm not sure why it's suddenly a good deal. But I guess part of that was not much competition from AMD.,rtx_3000
"Apple in comparison released the iPhone SE that offers identical performance to their top of the line iPhones at a similar price drop BUT they didn't release another iPhone that offers even more performance at the same time.

Economically speaking it's a great price. Their customers will probably buy it and nvidia won't sell it cheaper than necessary. However I don't know how expensive it is for nvidia to produce those 450mm² chips. Let's see what the Radeon Technology group brings to market and draw a conclusion.

On the one hand it's surprising they didn't increase the price this time around. Maybe because they expect competition to actually deliver but who knows. On the other hand it's not a great price for some piece of silicon in 2020",rtx_3000

"Twice of 2080, not 2080 ti",rtx_3000
This is likely 2x performance over a 2080 specifically in ray tracing. Playing 1440p COD with no RT active will likely not get you anywhere close to 2x performance.,rtx_3000
I wouldn’t doubt it at all. But that doesn’t mean this one isn’t flagship. The 3080ti will likely release after AMD lineup comes out.,rtx_3000
Except it isn’t. The 3080 was literally called the flagship. The 3090 is the Titan card rebranded.,rtx_3000

"Yeah the 3080 has a gig less in VRAM but the memory bandwidth is close to double the 1080ti (760GBps vs 484GBps). I'm betting the difference in that specific regard will be unnoticable, and you're also getting the significant boosts in the other areas (8704 CUDA cores vs 3584).

At the very least, I’m going to wait until AMD presents what they have before making an upgrade. My 1080Ti is doing fine, so I’m still in no rush to get a new card.",rtx_3000
But isn't the VRAM significantly faster on the Ampere line than the Pascal line?,rtx_3000
It’s 1gb difference but 3080 has the gddr6x and a lot more bandwidth so it would definitely be an upgrade,rtx_3000
"If you wait a year, at that point you're only a year away from the 4000 series that's going to be far better value than a 3080 ti.  Personally, I'd just get the 3080 and enjoy it.   


We don't have benchmarks to even back the concept that a 20gb version is necessary. That's speculation at this point.",rtx_3000
"Just because you have 1 less gb doesn't make it a worse card. It has faster memory than your card and probably has improved compression methods.

The 2080 super beats the 1080ti in every way possible.. so I'm sure why this is even an issue

Edit: added more",rtx_3000

"Yeah you have to remember it’s not all about vram anymore. I have a 1080ti as well and it has zero tensor cores, half the CUDA cores, one encoder, etc. Also, look at your setting in say warzone. I can max out settings all on high and not even get close to max vram, but the game runs like shit and huge fps hits. 3080 might have less vram but crushes the 1080ti in every other category so it will run those games smoother, higher fps, and better quality of detail with ray tracing, dlss, etc.",rtx_3000
"Their Q&A explains the rationale behind only 10gb of VRAM, not sure if that helps your decision.",rtx_3000
How many games use more than 10 gigs ?,rtx_3000
From what I've seen they're utilising tensor cores to compress information stored in VRAM. It's also a 320 bit bus so it's faster than the 1080 ti meaning information doesnt stay in VRAM as long. It is technically 1gb less but it is actually an upgrade.,rtx_3000
Yeah I'm in a weird spot with a 2080 Super (granted I paid $600 for it on sale). I think I want to wait and see if a Ti or one with more Vram comes out since I only just got it and the wait after the initial ones is gonna be insane,rtx_3000

There are a lot of applications and games that can actually **use** the full 11GB on a 1080 TI/2080 TI.",rtx_3000
"That's fair, I've never had that happen on my 1080 Ti and I play at 3840x1600, but like you said it's more nuanced than just used VRAM. A lot of that comes down to how the cards handle and compress certain things in memory.

My thought is that I CANNOT imagine Nvidia would release a new flagship GPU that bottlenecks in new games bc of vram alone lol",rtx_3000
"I was planning on dropping about a grand on a new graphics card but that extra 500 makes me question it. My income is high enough it's not too big of a hit if I go that route especially since I was already planning on waiting till December when cyberpunk launches.I guess it's a matter of not buying another one for 5 years or so. I've had my 1070 since its launch and it's still a solid card so I'm not too worried. I guess I've never been able to afford a flagship card so now that I can I want one.

I mean let's be honest I'm just talking myself into it.",rtx_3000
"Just the specs on paper shows it should. 35 percent more next gen CUDA cores. Total memory bandwidth is a little slower, but overclocking memory didn't make huge strides with the 2080ti anyway but this is likely the part that makes it more even given increased cores, lower cost and less power used and way more ray tracing and tensor capabilities.",rtx_3000

"On the upper end there is no limit, VR is best at with Super Sampling at 150% ... so we talking > 4k gaming depending on the headset ... and you want rock solid 90Hz (me at east).

I am going straight for 3090 FE if I can get my hands on one or EVGA Hydro.

3090 will make VR more relevant than ever.  I love some me some 2d games ... but vr (done right) well is just amazing.  I recently clocked 250hrs in Skyrim VR modded.  For an old game the experience was amazing.  Tacking a life sized dragon overhead with a bow, is not something you can explain.  Then there is Half Life Alyx,  FO4VR was very poorly built, so unlike Skyrm it does not translate that well, but I would not call it bad.  Sim games like Elite Dangerous and well new MS Flight Sim ... yea, I think VR nuts like me will be all lining up for 3090s.

"They had no choice but to release the 2080 ti at launch for Turing.  It meant they had to go a year without a flagship launch, something they hadn't done since 2011 (which was necessitated by the bad press the 480 got).  I doubt it was something they wanted to do, but they knew that ""barely better raster performance"" wasn't going to cut it.

The 3080 being GA102 as well though makes me think it's less likely for a 3080 ti to appear.  But not unheard of since the 780 was GK110 just like the Titan and later 780 ti.",rtx_3000
"Well, if the 20-series was a fluke, then we should discard the entire series and compare the 3090 to the Pascal Titan, which means the 3090 is still a $300 bump. :)

I don't know where the 3090 lies between the 2080 TI and Titan in Nvidia's plans, but I think the best answer would be in the number they are manufacturing not what they say in a hype stream.",rtx_3000
"There will be something between $700 and $1500, and I have no reason to think it won't be called the 3080 Ti. But names are just names - each generation Nvidia studies the market and the technology they have and figures out how many models to make and what sectors of the market they will target. Then they slap whatever name they want on each for whatever reason they want. 

Last generation, the 2080 Ti targeted the smallish market of gamers that were willing to spend a fortune for a great graphics card. And the Titan targeted the tiny market of gamers that were willing to spend two fortunes to have the absolute best. My guess would be that this generation, the technological improvements were enough to beat the RTX Titan at a much lower production cost - so the 3090 covers everyone in the market for a Titan, but it also catches they eye of people looking at the 3080 Ti slot.

"Kinda sucks for the 3080 people as those cards are out first and will most likely sell out instantly. So, if you wait for reviews you are waiting for at least a few weeks.

I suspect it would be worth the upgrade if you are still on the 10 series (like me) regardless, but some people with 2080tis (rip) might want to wait.

"I have a 8GB 2070 Super, and it's more than enough for 1440p. Control is the most demanding game I've tried, and it sits at ~6GB even with everything cranked up. It's a bit disappointing there is no increase in size, but there is a definite increase in throughput, and that's what matters.

In any case, VRAM limitations are for game developers to overcome, not for gamers to cry over. The developers will aim to fit into certain hardware requirements. This would maybe only become a problem in modding games, like pushing 4K textures to Skyrim used to be.",rtx_3000

I don't see any need to edit my comment.

There's no harm in suggesting that people should wait for third party benchmarks.",rtx_3000
"No, that’s not at all how RT works on the baseline 2080 in order for the 3080 to show improvement over it. The calculations are too different—raster & RT have different acceleration pipelines.

Things gonna be ~5% worse than the 3090 but the price could be anywhere from 899-1199. They won't announce it's existence until AMD shows their hand.

"They billed it as the successor for the Titan, then showed off its prowess at gaming (8k, 60fps). I fully expect a 3080ti to come along in ~6 months that has 3090 gaming performance at a lower price. That was how TI releases typically worked before the 20-series.",rtx_3000
"No 3090 should be over 50% better than the 2080ti, it's the 3080 that will only be just over 20% better.

Those boost clocks are low for the 3090 at only being in the 1600s. If that card can be OC'd to 2k it will be interesting to see what kind of performance uplift it will make.

Prolly disappointing as usual with modern hardware. 400mhz for all of 15 fps at best. The 1k series was the first terrible OCers since they were doing their best out of the box practically. 900 series was the last beast OCers in that you could pump 500 mhz into a 980ti and get like 30+ extra fps sometimes...",rtx_3000

On my current PSU I have two 8-pins, but they're sitting on the same cable and (I presume) drawing from the same circuit, so whatever power is being supplied on that circuit would be shared between both connectors.

AMD to this day hasnt even competed with turing. They are an entire generation behind.

"Per the 3090 accouncement:

>  Several years ago, we started building the Titan, pushing the GPU to the absolute limit to create the best graphics card of that generation. It was built in limited quantities, only through Nvidia. The distribution was limited. The demand surprised us. Creatives were making 4k movies, rendering cinematics, researchers built workstations for data science and AI, bloggers built broadcast workstations, flight and racing simulation fans built sim rigs. There is clearly a need for a giant GPU that is available all over the world. So we made a giant Ampere. Ladies and gentlemen, the RTX 3090.

So, if you read this closely and think about it, what Jensen is saying is that they created the Titan for purpose ""X"", but were surprised how high the demand was due to people wanting it for for purposes ""X, Y, Z, A, B, & C"". The 3090 is basically a lower cost and lower price(!!!) product that is able to attract the attention of people who want to do ""X, Y, Z, A, B, & C"". But there is nothing stopping them from releasing a Titan card that is unquestionably better than the 3090 and fulfills ""X, and maybe Y, & Z"" better than the 3090 can.

As mentioned above, the 3090 is $1000 less than the Titan RTX! Am I really supposed to believe that Nvidia lowered the Titan's price by $1000 just to be nice? By releasing a 3090 with higher performance but the same amount of video ram, they will naturally get many Titan owners to upgrade. If they release an Ampere Titan a year from now with 32+GB of video ram and higher specs, not only will many Titan owners upgrade to it, but they will likely get double dip purchases from a decent segment of the people who bought a 3090. The people who care about ""X, and maybe Y, & Z"". Plus, they could price said Titan at or above historical Titan Prices, so $2500-4000 would make sense. Not to mention that they could almost certainly get a decent performance uplift by having the Titan manufactured by TSMC rather than Samsung.

In short, splitting that market segment just makes sense from a business and technical perspective, especially if they don't launch or announce a Titan until after the 3090 has been out for a while. Jensen's wording about the 3090 fulfilling the surprise demand that the Titan garnered leaves a ton of room for a Titan to come in later and be exactly what the Titan is always supposed to be, a card that pushes ""the GPU to the absolute limit to create the best graphics card of that generation"".

Edit: I just reread your comment and I'd also like to stress that Nvidia has a long history of **not** announcing their entire product stack at one time",rtx_3000

"Buy 3080, upgrade later.

I'm tempted by the 3090 for VR on the Index (and future headsets) but as others have pointed out- more than twice as much money for how much better performance?

The 3080 is already a pretty huge upgrade over a 2080 Ti, and won't be hard to sell once a 3080 Ti/Super drops. So if you find that it's not quite hitting the numbers you want, at least you've got the best (affordable) card in the meantime till the refresh comes out.",rtx_3000

I might wait for the 3080ti as well, as the 3090 seems to be the rebranded Titan. If I stick with my plan of getting the Ti for every other generation, that would be the way for me to go too.

(Honestly renaming the Titan to the 3090 is probably a great marketing move, since I was really considering pulling the trigger on the 3090 until I realized it's the Titan. ""Titan"" screams ""Too much money"" to me while naming it the 3090 just somehow makes it seem more like part of the regular lineup).",rtx_3000

"Valve index is 2880x1440p @ 144hz.

Often you are super sampling up near 4k.  If it drops below 144hz it drops the display to 72fps to accommodate for lag.

DLSS is not available for VR, so there are no shortcuts to get around it.  If you want to max out your VR headset, you sadly will need the 3090, or settle for undersampling, or running the display in 90hz mode.",rtx_3000
What exactly are you smoking?,rtx_3000
"I have a 2060mq and I have played numerous DLSS titles. It depends on your settings but so far for me it has varied between maybe 5% worse IQ in performance mode, to 10% better in quality, and all with 80-20% higher frame rates respectively. 

The reason it can get better IQ is because it is running at a lower resolution using the same hardware as without DLSS so it can actually run at higher settings other than resolution. But then it uses the Turing cores, which otherwise are doing nothing or are under-used, and upscales the image and fixes all the aliasing caused by doing so, giving you the resolution back without any real cost. In fact it can do it so well that in many cases the IQ is clearly better with DLSS than without at the same resolution. (e.g. Some writing in Death Stranding is actually far more clear with DLSS on). 

Have you actually used it?",rtx_3000
You can look into benchmarks for Death Stranding with and without DLSS to learn a lot. Even if games implement it poorly that doesn't make it not very useful when done right as has been well proven.,rtx_3000

That said, if you really need the extra vram specifically, the rumored 3080 Ti/Super with 20gb might be worth waiting for. If you don't use all 11gb currently for something like video production, then you could always go 3080 for now and sell when the Ti/Super comes out.",rtx_3000

1440p, maxing out VRAM and stuttering because of it.  One game I've played so far, several have used 7GB+ but it's been common enough I don't bother remembering which ones because it hasn't been notable information for a long time.

And I rarely play AAA games, and definitely not when they're new and full price.  If I do play one, it's likely optimized for high performance since it's almost definitely a competitive game as I just rarely play single player in general.

"A game doesn't have to require the VRAM to be playable, but it can require it for certain settings.  Textures is a good example of something that often has a huge visual impact but little performance cost so long as you stay within your VRAM limits.  It's not even necessarily that unreasonable texture sizes will happen and you won't feel bad for not using full.  Rather the extra VRAM can get used to have more objects in the scene that are textured, so you now have to play newer games with a lower texture resolution than older ones simply because there's more textures used at once.

Even ignoring the 3090, there's two cards, one of which is now 4 years old, with 11 GB.  AMD's next gen is almost definitely going to be above 8GB because AMD has a habit of pushing VRAM.  Yeah Navi doesn't exactly have more than Turing, but Navi has no top end cards.  The R9 290X came with an 8GB config while the later released 980 ti was limited to 6GB.  The Vega Frontier had 16GB when nvidia's $1200 GPU the 2080 ti was still sitting on 11GB.

"I agree power draw and performance don't scale linearly, I never said nor hinted at this, all I gave were the current numbers from AMD themselves which show they have some headroom to work with in power draw, which will definitely yield more performance.


I would also agree with you that you can't compare CUs across generations, but it should be expected that a newer generation would not perform worse than the old one, right? I genuinely don't know, but I would simply think so.


I would disagree that $699 is almost half as much as a $999 msrp, but I do agree that the performance for the price is great. Why can't I compare the 3080 to the 2080ti in terms of performance though? The mindset doesn't change when comparing it to a 2080 or 2080 Super. I used the 2080ti because it's easier to use the top model from the previous gen when comparing numbers. None of that changes the rumors from AMD though.

AMD did compete with Turing in the midrange market, the 5700xt was in many scenarios better than a 2070, [and on average only 9% slower than a 2070 Super while being $100 less, or 20% cheaper. So 80% as much money for 90% as much power sounds pretty competitive to me.](https://www.techspot.com/review/2015-geforce-rtx-2070-super-vs-radeon-5700-xt/) The 5700xt was also never meant to be an enthusiast level GPU though, so I definitely wouldn't say they're an entire generation behind. Plus if they weren't competitive, why would Nvidia release the Super variants of their cards? Why not just sit on what you have for another year before the 30 series comes out?


I do agree that AMD's GPU and CPU divisions are separate and different entities, and thus I have made no comparisons between the two, and do not intend to. I would however simply dispute that the Ryzen 1700 itself was a much better processor than the 7700k in terms of price and multicore performance, which has helped keep the 1700 *much* more relevant today than the 7700k. The 1700 obviously did lose out in single core speeds, but I would not consider losing in a singular category of a top end product to be noncompetitive, especially considering the budget/midrange markets were dominated by AMD CPUs.


As I said before, we'll straight up have to wait and see what happens in October. I do trust the numbers AMD has talked about, because I simply have no reason not to. I will say though that I don't expect AMD to be competitive beyond traditional rendering; their ray tracing performance definitely won't be near Nvidia's 30 series performance.",rtx_3000
"Hidey ho neighborino, remember me? 

So not only [did AMD hit that 2x mark with the 6800xt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410571070488444938/771043527169015839/unknown.png) and the [50% perf/watt target](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410571070488444938/771043232683393114/unknown.png) there's also the 6900xt which at the same wattage takes things a step further to improving [perf/watt by 65%](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/187788592276439040/771046877830971422/unknown.png) Seems like not only was it a target, but a realistic expectation where they did not overpromise and underdeliver, something they haven't really done much under Su's direction and leadership. 
And just as expected in traditional rendering [at 1440p](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410571070488444938/771044375807262791/unknown.png) the 6800xt is competitive with the 3080, as well as [in 4K](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/187788592276439040/771045146060914708/unknown.png)


AMD is already competitive just with that singular offering, as expected, but of course the 6900xt [competes even with the 3090](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/187788592276439040/771046978149810186/unknown.png) for $500 less.


Now I said a month ago I didn't expect AMD to be competitive beyond traditional rendering, and the leaked benchmarks combined with the fact that AMD didn't really talk about it much at all definitely support that idea. NVIDIA still has DLSS which in its 2.0 format now is actually pretty compelling, and in my opinion probably worth the extra $50 right there for the 3080. The ray tracing performance of the 30 series compared to the 6800xt, according to the [leaked benchmarks,](https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-big-navi-gpu-3dmark-benchmarks-leaked/) which do hold up pretty well, suggest AMD is around 20% down in performance there, again making the 3080 a better overall value outside of traditional rendering. Maybe there's something to be gained there with later drivers from AMD, because we know historically launch drivers for new AMD products are not the best in the world.


Given that this is AMD's first generation with ray tracing though, that's not too bad. It performs better than the 2080ti in that specific ray tracing benchmark, and at $50 less than the 3080, the 6800xt provides *some* competition. Given the 16gb of VRAM vs 10gb, we may see the 6800xt take the top spot in the future when 10gb just isn't enough anymore, like for 8K rendering. The 6900xt though absolutely gives people an option of spending a little bit more for some more performance, and definitely looks like a better value than the 3090.

It's impossible to say for sure, but I can't see it being a huge bottleneck from a.) the performance shown on DF's video today on the 3080, and b.) Nvidia touting it as their flag ship, it's hard to imagine them neutering it if 10GB really weren't enough.

What are you talking about?  The letter change means literally nothing it was purely a marketing move because the main ""feature"" of the RTX series was ray tracing.  The SKUs did *NOT* shift at all, the prices just went up plain and simple.  The 2080ti was not a successor for the Titan any more than the 2070 was a successor to the 1080 and if you're using those comparisons then the performance bump being smaller than usual is even *WORSE*.

> Whatever the case may be, please don't use model numbers as if they have any meaning whatsoever.

Actually Nvidia's model numbers have been extremely consistent over the last 10-15 years, the only thing that's been ""confusing"" for people is their introduction of additional cards like the 1660 and 1650 and then the super cards last generation.  You can go all the way back to the 200-series and the 60, 70, 80 numbering scheme has been the same.  The same can be said ever since they started doing the 80ti series of cards.

LOL.  That isn't what you use to compare GPUs across generations, because obviously the newer cards are always going to be better performance for the money than the previous generation.  That's why I've been telling anyone considering a higher end card (especially the 2080ti) to wait... because spending $1200-1500 on a 2 year old card is *STUPID* when you're weeks away from the next generation.

You compare GPUs across generations to their equivalent model based on MSRP from the previous generation and also based on their respective improvements over their predecessor.  So for the 2070 you would compare it against the 3070 and then compare the performance increase between those to the performance increase from the 1070 to the 2070.  Go watch Hardware Unboxed's video comparing the 2080ti vs 1080ti vs 980ti and you'll see what I mean.  The 2080ti was on average 20-30% faster than the 1080ti, but the 1080ti was on average 50-60% faster than the 980ti.

That's why people were upset at the pricing of the 2000-series GPUs, because not only were they a lackluster performance bump but the 70% price increase from the 1080ti to the 2080ti was ridiculous and in no way justified.  The people who bought the 2080ti got probably the worst value in the history of dedicated graphics cards for the performance/price ratio. 

> I agree that the 20 series was lacking in performance improvement, but saying it's become more expensive is kind of stupid, considering you can buy something for the same price with better performance, even if it's called FTX 12345

What are you even talking about?  I'm talking about the price bump from the 1000-series to the 2000-series cards for the mediocre performance bump and you're talking about SKU's shifting (which hasn't happened at all).",rtx_3000
"What's that supposed to be, proof that anyone can make stupid memes that don't make sense and lack any kind of context?  You don't seem to understand so let me put it in numbers, here are the *FACTS*:

- 970 > 1070 = 50%~ increase in performance ($50 increase)

- 980 > 1080 = 70%~ increase in performance ($50 increase)

- 980ti > 1080ti = 70%~ increase in performance ($50 increase)

- 1080 > 2080 = 20%~ increase in performance ($100 increase)

- 1070> 2070 = 25%~ increase in performance ($120 increase)

- 1080ti > 2080ti = 30%~ increase in performance ($500 increase)

Now tell me again how they changed SKUs and the price didn't increase...

Nvidia's naming conventions are just dumb.",rtx_3000
"The one you list as Titan Xp was just a slang term people used for it. Its name was just Titan X, exactly like the previous Titan X. People started referring to it as Titan XP to make it clear which Titan X they meant. Then after the 1080 ti launched, they did a refreshed Titan X called the Titan XP, which meant we had to call the earlier one Xp to differentiate from the new one. Point is, Nvidia naming has been stupid for years.",rtx_3000

right but going from the new benchmark we saw it's a ~67% increase over a 2080 in some games that are hand picked by nvidia. While that's still good I would doubt a 3080 is more than enough especially taking into account how vram hungry vr is,rtx_3000
"There is no such thing as ""enough"" for VR.",rtx_3000
"Valve wanted to Future proof, but for them what really made the difference was having that high frame rate, they felt it made VR more like reality.  The resolution was modest, the audio, refresh rate, comfort of the headset itself, and field of view were the main focus.  Most other headsets still are 90hz or below in refresh rate, and are focusing more on raw resolution.

If you do the math, running 4k @ 60hz is about 497 million pixels,

running Valve index 2880 x 1440 @ 144hz is about 597 million pixels.

Reverb G2 is  2160 x 2160 **per eye** @ 90hz is about  **839 million pixels.**

"I mean if you pay attention at all you know there’s absolutely no way AMD can compete in the high end given their strategy.  They don’t spend enough on R&D.  It’s as simple as that.  Nor would it make sense for them too.  Their market is console-￼makers and cheap pc gamers.  Nvidia spends billions because they also have the fast-growing AI market on lockdown along with high-end pc gamers.

It’s so sad to see the AMD fanboy circlejerk try to pretend that AMD has any chance at competing in the high-end market.",rtx_3000
Percentage base values are pointless anyways because obviously 100% more of 30 is a lot less then 100% more of 60. You have no idea what the base value is. Im sure if your going from a 970 to one of the new cards you will be thrilled though.,rtx_3000

"cmon man, the gtx 980 was released at $550 and it was ~50% faster than the 780. 1080 was released at $550 and it was at least 50% faster than the 980.

"I'm aware, but running out of VRAM is a great way to not get all that extra performance the card can do, and I already see some games using the entire 11gigs on my 1080ti. From what I can gather tho that's the allocation not the actual usage. Doesn't seem to be an easy way to tell how much VRAM the game actually needs.",rtx_3000
1 gig less is pretty negligible when you are getting DOUBLE the speed. Or at least so I would assume.,rtx_3000
"Not only the VRAM, the cards raw performance will probably be something like 3 times as fast as a 970.

3080 will offer a significant performance bump over even the 2080ti, as long as the 10gig VRAM isn't holding it back.",rtx_3000

"I'm not expecting ultra quality settings at 100fps, my two side monitors are only 60hz anyways (because up until now there was no gpu that could ever hope to run that past 60fps) but rather than medium-high settings in games like War Thunder and Elite dangerous with dips below 60 the raw performance bump the 3080 offers over 1080ti will get me to high settings 60fps in the games I play, provided the VRAM isn't a problem.

Looks the 3080 is going to be about 50 percent faster than a 1080ti, give or take.",rtx_3000
"I know the memory bandwidth is literally twice as fast as my 1080ti, I'm just not sure how much that matters if I ever run into a game that needs more than 10gigs.

I guess I'll find out tho, ima pull the trigger on an Asus msi or evga 3080 as soon as they hit Amazon.

"I thought they were gonna go the other way, and make the 3090 $999, and blow everyone's minds.  If they had done that, they would have had a ton of people like you and me getting it for the memory more than the added performance.",rtx_3000
"Is it horrible performance/$? It's less, for sure, but the highest end is always less.

"Well, **technically**, speaking frequency of cores would have mattered *IF* we were talking about *different architectures.*

"It is not misleading, but people has the wrong assumption on what a cuda core is, (a cuda core for NVIDIA is a FP32 ALU).

The 3090 has 10496 FP32 ALU, and 5288 INT ALU. Inside each SM, there are 2 data paths that can work concurrently. There is a pure FP32 path (which allows half precision) with 16 ALU, and FP32 / INT32 path with 16 FP32 ALU and 16 INT ALU which can't work at the same time, so in a pure synthetic load of a perfect mix of FP32 and INT32, the 3090 would be around 18TFlops FP32 ""only"". This, doesn't happen never in a game or even professional application. INT32 ALU are reserved for specific tasks like addressing memory or counting, which never takes half of the GPU time in any game or application like Blender, Premiere or After Effects. Even audio processing is moving to FP32 floating point in order to be mastered and processed, so you don't have problems with dynamic range.

Maybe I am too old, but this already happened between the 580 and 680. The 580 had only 512 CUDA cores, while the 680 had 1536 CUDA cores, it has double the shader performance (as it didn't have a shader clock), and it was 60% faster in games.

The 3080 is 30% faster than a 2080TI in raster performance, which is a good step up considering the price. The more compute heavy the game is, the more is going to scale. Most likely, in the games where the RADEON VII do good, the 3080 gain will be greater as well.",rtx_3000

">Doesn't that seem a key difference to you? That the Titan was so ridiculous an engineering feat that only Nvidia could pull it off and even then at great cost. Owning it was so exclusive that you didn't even share a numbering scheme with the peons cards. Everything about the 3090 on the other hand is being handled as if it were an extension of the 30XX line.


Not really. It seems more like a business decision. It was something they didn't really expect a lot of people to buy. But people did anyways in quite a large number.",rtx_3000
"I imagine the main consumer base for the titan series cards were professionals who needed monster workstation power without moving to GPU-server architectures - video production, 3D/graphic design; I know we had a bunch of them in our AI labs.

"There are more games that aren't AAA than there are games that *are* AAA.  Like I said before I don't play AAA games, but my VRAM is going over 7 GB usage in so many games it's not even worth remembering which ones it does that in.

A game exists that shows 8GB isn't enough so now you've pushed the goalpost to keep saying you're right.  But the fact is you were wrong, because games where 8GB isn't enough at 1440p exist.",rtx_3000
Because I played it for a month and it started stuttering after an update that made it max out my VRAM (previous to that it almost never went over 7800 MB).  It stuttered every time the VRAM hit the full 8GB.  Lowering textures so that VRAM was no longer maxing out completely removed the stuttering despite keeping GPU usage at 99%.,rtx_3000

See 1080p high. Just over 10gb used. I'm only pointing this out because I want to upgrade f on a 1080ti myself to a 3080, but I need to see some extensive cram benchmarks first.",rtx_3000
"The problem I see is supposed leaks of a higher memory version of the 3080 and AMD's likelihood of releasing higher memory spec.

If you were gaming at 1440p back in the Maxwell days you totally could've lived with the GTX 970 or 980's VRAM.  But by 2017, the year after nvidia and AMD made 6-8 GB very common, so many games were pushing over 4GB easily.

I end up lowering a lot of settings to keep high framerate.  There's plenty that offer minimal visual difference.  But two that I never want to compromise on are texture quality (except 4k textures are totally unnecessary for most things but they're very rare) and anisotropic filtering.  I value a clean crisp look and these two settings are not only huge in providing that but pretty much just purely reliant on VRAM.  In my experience when VRAM maxes out you don't simply lose FPS... instead the games begin stuttering.",rtx_3000

Not the best picture quality, but at the time, it was a good bit cheaper than some of the brand name options, and I like that it doesn't have a heavy anti glare coating that distorts the picture like a lot of dell monitors can have. 

I wasn't expecting to have to drop $ on a monitor when i was already spending out the butt for my new system, but its fine for what it is, and my local frys actually had them in stock, so i was a bit impatient and picked it up vs saving a bit for a name brand and having it shipped to me.

"your cables should be 8-pin into the PSU, and 8+8 at the other end (with one of the 8 really being a 6+2).   
the adapter takes 2 8 pin connectors (from 2 different cables) and converts them to 1 12-pin.  
in this scenario, you will have 2 8+8 cables from your PSU, with each one using 1 of it's 8-pin output in the adapter and the other one left unplugged.",rtx_3000
"We don't know what differences PCIE3 vs PCIE4 will make in the GPU slot for the 3000 series. Nvidia so far have said the new cards ""support"" it, but what that actually means is anyone's guess. PCIE4 is still not widely adopted among gamers, so I can't see the 3000 series losing huge amounts of performance over PCIE3.

This being said the 2080ti does already saturate the PCIE3 x16 slot, as evidenced by the fact that if you plug it into a PCIE x8 slot (not the top PCIE slot, one of the lower ones, usually only the top is full x16 and the rest are lower) then you can see some very small performance drops. These drops are less than 5%, and often just 2% or so, which is very small, but if the 2080ti is already bumping up against the limits of PCIE3 x16 then realistically the 3000 series might benefit from PCIE4 in some more tangible ways.

Long story short, you can use the 3000 with likely no issues and get a lot of power out of it on PCIE3. For future proofing however, if you've got the money down the line then investing in a new mobo that supports PCIE4 would be a good idea, also given that PCIE4 support for NVME drives will hopefully become a big thing with RTX IO.",rtx_3000

"You can't explain it because what you're saying is stupid.

When you're comparing cards across generations you compare cards against their comparable place within the lineup, and since Nvidia is extremely consistent in their *CORE* lineup that's really easy.

If you want to do that you need to consider *used* prices and not MSRP, and considering I bought a 1080 last fall for $150 to put in my brother's build why don't you tell me what you can buy right now from the 2000-series in that price point and we can do a comparison of performance.",rtx_3000

"As others have stated, I think the way you're looking at VRAM is outdated. This VRAM is an order of magnitude faster, combined with IO boosts coming in the future and modern games being optimized for the lower amount of VRAM found on the new consoles, we will likely not need as much VRAM since we don't have to keep as much in memory given how much faster we can load it in.",rtx_3000
"Scarlet/Lockhart only has 12GB and we assume 8.5 available to GPU.

Scarlet/Anaconda has 12.5 available to the GPU but its pulling from the SSD to VRAM.

On PC you'll be pulling from system RAM to your 10GB.  Make sure you get the full 3600 speed DDR4 and you'll effectively have the full 30GB/s bandwidth to VRAM.  That's plenty to handle any texture juggling the card would need to do.  You'll lose literally 0 fps. 

The predictive algorithms are only going to get better cause of consoles pulling from an SSD at only 8GB/s.  Sure you'll have 10GB instead of 12.5GB, but you'll have 3x to 4x the bandwidth to get those textures into VRAM.

It'll be fine.  More than fine.",rtx_3000
">Explain to me how loading textures from SSD instead of RAM does reduce VRAM usage. I'm curious.

Easy - the argument is that most stuff in VRAM isn't used that much.  Instead, it's being cached \*in case\* it is needed.  This makes sense when memory is cheap, and IO is slow.  


These days the reverse is true.  Memory is expensive, but IO is fast.  All the major players are developing technology to help reduce how much unnecessary data is stored in memory, and instead use IO to load the data on a more 'as needed' basis.",rtx_3000

But there are people with hardware that has more than 8 GB of VRAM *today* and have been *for the last 3 years.*  And after the next generation GPU launch that number is going to increase.  The more people have that hardware the more developers feel safe taking advantage of it.

But here's the thing.  That's what it is.  *Taking advantage of it.*  Games these days are optimized to a point that you can catch the culling in real gameplay, or done so via very clever level design that limits what you can see at any moment.  But that's limiting.

Yeah Doom runs really good, but it's a linear hallway shooter.  It is not a huge open world environment.

I guess my main thoughts are I'm not concerned with not waiting for accurate benchmarks when buying a new card because 1. I'm not going to sell my card until I have the new card and am satisfied, even if I take a hit 2. My risk is minimal if the card doesn't perform as well as I had hoped, because if such is the case I have quite a while to return it.  


We all assess risk probably slightly differently, but that's basically my equation, and it's never been an issue for me.

Also a snippet from the article you linked:

""The coat of arms of the Federal Bureau of Control, FBC for short, **looks a little sharper with the DLSS quality mode than with the native rendering, reflections and shadows are displayed more clearly.""**

""At 600 percent magnification, you can even **see individual folds in the red leather shirt that are not natively displayed.** The controls on the mixer are also easier to distinguish from one another. The AI ​​renderer can still display details that are actually not visible in 4K resolution. This works because the DLSS algorithm is trained on images that have a higher resolution and therefore more detail.""

""The assessment of the image sections, enlarged by 800 percent, **is congruent with the previous results. You can see a little more details in DLSS quality mode than in native 4K resolution.** Overall, everything looks a tad clearer and sharper without giving the impression of noise.""



Even the fucking website you're trying to use to say DLSS 2.0 is shit claims it's better than native.

Here's the conclusions from the author:***""DLSS 2.0 increases the frame rate enormously and the image quality does not suffer as a result. Often the opposite is the case: DLSS tickles out some details that are not even rendered in the native resolution.""***

R20 cinebench doesnt get it hot enough. Run an AVX2 small packet load in OCCT to truly test for temp stability. It's also nice because it's not an entirely unrealistic synthetic load, I actually found a game that runs a similar load called Dual Universe. Never seen a game run my CPU that hard.

If you look through my post history you'll find where I attached PCI expansion slot covers to the rad and threaded them through the case to attach the rad in a nonstandard manner.",rtx_3000
Nope. It's just hard to justify spending $1500 on a product that still has somewhat significant compromises even over the last gen Turing cards.,rtx_3000

"3070 doesn't require any adapter right?
Same old cables?

I don't know if I should get 3080 because I'm running 1080p 144hz monitor.
What do you think?",rtx_3000

You sure did switch sides quick after getting into an argument with me standing on the opposite side 🤣,rtx_3000
Probs right about 4k. I have 3 1440p monitors tho and there's no way I'm replacing all 3 with 4k monitors so 4k thing doesn't concern me. VR kinda does tho.,rtx_3000
I always go with custom PCB designs because I like overclocking.,rtx_3000
"Yeah the strix does look great, that's my number 1 pick (I've had an amazing experience with my Strix 1080ti) but I'm gonna have to buy whichever one comes in stock first I think.",rtx_3000
Maybe when DDR5 system ram rolls around it will be fast enough to allow that sort of thing?,rtx_3000
"250W is the stock power limit, did you max the power limit in whatever software you use for OC?

Noted on cinebench, I'll give that other one a look if it's free.

The nice thing about NZXT AIOs, or at least my particular X63 model is that the tubes are very long.

Also, check out the images of the new design Asus is using for the 3080. Dunno if it's better performance wise but it looks pretty cool. The old design definitely seems a bit dated.",rtx_3000
"Yeah, your right for 1500 it should have everything on it plus the kitchen sink.",rtx_3000
"Why would you want to do that?  RAM to VRAM can saturate the entire 30GB/s bandwidth of PCIe3.0 x16 lane.  You'd be limited to PCIe3.0 x4 lane bandwidth coming from the SSD (let alone the fact not even NVME drives except the absolute bleeding edge atm can even saturate 4 lanes of PCIe3.0 anyway).

You'd always want to buffer and textures you think you may need soon, but don't need right now in system RAM when VRAM is full, in order to call it up faster.

A hybrid approach is most likely I guess.  You'd probably save a little latency by going PCIe to PCIe direct from the SSD, but that would only be relevant if your predictive algorithm has completely shit the bed and just completely missed preloading a texture into system RAM.

I would be shocked if this tech is actually relevant on PC gaming.

Edit: I know what it's for.  The initial loading cycle for textures.  Initial boot up for the game would be much much faster doing it this way.",rtx_3000
"All 30XX will be using the new adapter. For 1080p 144hz 3070 is likely more than enough for a while, but really I would wait on benchmarks to judge.",rtx_3000
"> I don't understand why you compare a 499$ gpu with a much cheaper one.

Why?  Because that's it's equivalent model, and contrary to what you seem to think they didn't ""change the SKUs"" which you can see based on the average performance increase vs the price increase across the entire lineup for the last three generations.  I can go farther and include more models if you like, the numbers are going to show the same thing and I can say that confidently because I've built dozens of computers over the last 20 years.

The 970 was $50 less than the 1070, but the 1070 was 50% higher performance.  The 980 was $50 less than the 1080, but the 1080 was 70% better performance.  The 980ti was $50 less than the 1080ti, but the 1080ti was 70% higher performance.  See a pattern?

Now look at my second set of numbers again.  The 2070 was only a 25% performance increase over the 1070 for a $120 bump.  The 2080 was 20% performance for $100 more, and the 2080ti was 30% (best case) for $500.  

You don't get to cherry pick which cards to compare when you're talking about generational improvement it's the improvements across the entire core lineup.  So what if the 2070 was close to a 1080?  If you had a 1070 would you spend $500 for a 25% increase in performance?  I sure as hell wouldn't and that's what makes the context relevant.

> I'm sorry that you're having such a hard time accepting the truth.

I'm sorry you don't understand basic concepts.

> Maybe I'll make a whole graphic tomorrow so I can show you what I mean, but not sure if that's worth the effort if you're already that hard in denial and don't want to understand anyways.

Don't waste your time, it's crystal clear you don't have a very good understanding of this subject because I've explained it with hard numbers directly comparing both price and performance increase across the last three generations and yet somehow you don't understand.",rtx_3000
"Haha, I think I just figured out why you are being so daft. You built that lukewarm machine just 5 months ago, proudly showed it off and now Nvidia is launching cards that are absolutely trashing it. This is just you being butthurt and want everybody else to suffer, while we buy cards more in line with the pre-20xx pricing and performance hikes. 

God damn that's funny dude.",rtx_3000
"Oh boy, are you still malding enough to follow me around, haha. Isn't it funny your BIG REVEAL posts netted you... just downvotes. Nobody gave a shit. 

Ouch, that's gotta sting... must be why you need to follow me around like my own personal dog, hahaha.",rtx_3000
"I'm actually watching my buddy play alyx right now and it caps at exactly 10gb. I'd say besides games that are crappily ported to vr, this would be the worst case scenario.",rtx_3000
"I did, I also did a shunt mod on this GPU as I have the cooling to handle the increased thermal load. It was just that particular game didnt put a heavy enough load to draw more wattage, wasnt something I tested extensively. 

OCCT is free but the fucks will give you a 10 second ""please donate to us"" before it'll let you run a test. Still the best software for testing overclocking temps and stability I've found and you can send them $1 and never have that ad again.

I'm not a huge fan of the new Asus design. Not a huge fan of any of the designs I've seen tbh. But the stock cooler is going to sit in a box in my case so I'm more worried about what the waterblock will look like. 

Also not a single AIO has long enough tubes for these cases. Even pcpartpicker.com lists every single AIO as having a compatibility issue. 2 of very few cases I've seen designed specifically for a custom loop.",rtx_3000
"I think the 3090 FE also only has a single HDMI 2.1 port.

If I'm going to get a 3090 I would want the FE cooler but only aftermarket cards have the second HDMI 2.1

Since HDMI 2.1 has more bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.4, you also can't adapt from one of the DisplayPort ports.",rtx_3000
