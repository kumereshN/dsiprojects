0,1.0,MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 OpenGL 4.5 Single Fan Low Profile Graphics Card (GT 710 2GD3 LP),MSI COMPUTER,NVIDIA,2 GB,1600 MHz,$51.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive and works great in my small-form-factor PC,"I need a graphic card upgrade for a very old compact desktop PC, Acer Aspire A3910 from 2010. This  MSI GeForce GT 710  is an entry-level graphic card that fits my requirements perfectly. Here are several reasons why I picked this card instead of something more powerful:
- It is relatively inexpensive.
- It is low profile and occupies only one PCI slot. This is important since my PC has a SFF (small form factor) case with limited space.
- It consumes very little power (20W max), so even the 220W power supply in my PC can handle it.
- It uses only heatsink for passive cooling. This eliminates the noise and reliability problems associated with cooling fans.

[Installation Confusion]
- Initially right after the graphic card was installed, I can only get a display of 1200x800 from the HDMI port. Nothing from VGA port.
- After I installed the MSI VGA Drivers from disc, my monitor can now display 1920x1080 from VGA port, but nothing from HDMI port.

The problem could be from my computer's motherboard, since I observed the same behavior with the  EVGA GeForce 210  I previously purchased (and returned). Just keep this behavior in mind, in case you cannot see any display right after installing the card.

[Graphic Performance]
I ran the 3DMARK 'Cloud Gate' benchmark on my PC, both before and after the graphic card upgrade:
- With integrated graphic, the overall score is a pathetic 209.
- After installing the GT 710, the score jumps up to 3735!
(see my uploaded screenshots for details)

On the other hand, the GT 710 cannot hold a candle against my better graphic card, the  EVGA GeForce GTX 750 Ti . When both cards were tested in a newer desktop PC ( Asus M32CD ), the 750 gives about 4x higher score . Note that the 750 does not fit in my old SFF PC since it is much larger. See my photo uploaded for size comparison between 710 and 750.

[Power Consumption]
I used the  EUM-A1 Power Usage Meter  to measure the input power of my computer:
- Before the graphic card upgrade, my computer consumes ~50-55W when idle, ~70-75W when running 3DMARK.
- After the upgrade to GT 710, my PC consumes the same 50-55W when idle. This means this graphic card has the same standby power as the integrated graphic chip set.
- When running 3DMARK or  XCOM: Enemy Unknown , my PC now consumes up to 85-90W. That means the graphic card consumes 15-20W when it is running at full speed.

After I played XCOM for several hours, the heatsink becomes too hot to touch, but not hot enough to cause a shutdown. In contrast, the EVGA GeForce 210 suffers thermal shudown after just ~10-20 minutes of playing XCOM. This is because the 210 consumes more power (30W vs. 20W) but comes with a smaller heatsink.

[Conclusion]
The GT 710 works very well in my particular situation. Of cause this is an inexpensive entry-level card, so I cannot expect the same level of performance as my GeForce GTX 750 Ti. But for a very small investment, I'm suddenly able to play many games which were previously unplayable on my old SFF PC. For that I'm happy."

I was looking for a way to boost the performance of an old Gateway SX2801-01e, thin profile desktop. It was maxed out on RAM (8 GB), but for whatever reason, just couldn't seem to generate graphics smoothly and without struggling. Not gaming, mind you, but for place-shifting and streaming video, and having multiple applications open. This card fit in the sole expansion slot for a PCI x16 card. My main concern was that the dated BIOS would be too ancient, or that the card would simply freeze up the computer. Neither happened. It booted into low-resolution at first while the drivers updated automatically. But after the updates and a couple of reboots, I was back in business. This old desktop has new life, as it runs like a new computer. (I had already migrated to a Samsung SSD and added a USB 3.0 card.) The built-in 2GB or RAM is supremely helpful. I'm also running with a 220W power supply, and not the recommended 300W without issues. It consumes a mere 19W. I'm going to upgrade my older monitor with a higher-resolution one now that the graphics card can support it."

Instructions are not included for installing the low profile bracket. What you do:
Use a pair of needle nose pliers and unscrew the long bracket by twisting the little bolts that you woudl normally screw the video cable into. Just pinch the sides of each bolt and give little short twists (lefty loosey) until it comes loose, keep track of your bolts, and then once all four are out, you can easily separate the VGA socket (at the top in the main picture). The included short profile brackets are pretty obvious for placement, just watch the orientation. You'll end up using two of your external slots, but only the one PCI slot on the motherboard. The little bolts screw back in to the new brackets, and it's just fast and simple. I don't even think I ended up using a screwdriver at all, but the case we have was pretty much made for fast, painless installation without tools. The pliers are a must, though.

While this does say it requires a 300w power supply, it's running absolutely fine on a 240w power supply. Didn't even have to plug it in to a separate power cable (which is good, because there wasn't one.) We're using it for older Steam games (Spore, for example) for my kid, on a Windows 7 machine we bought for $250, and this upgrade brings the machine pretty painlessly up to a decent standard for a lot of games. Just don't try to max your graphics out, because you don't want to overheat a fanless card.

Anyway, I'm pleased. Oh, and everything comes packaged with little red caps over the connectors, which makes handling it a lot less nerve wracking while you're figuring the brackets out. A card I can hold easily while dicking around with the bracket? Thank you! They recommend using rubber gloves to avoid nicks, and I didn't, but this still may be the first time I've installed a video card when I didn't end up bleeding."

I need the sound for YouTube and other sounds on the PC. Video still works fine. Changed HDMI cables and tried switching ports on the TV/monitor. Still no sound. Support says get an RMA number on website and send it in for repair. That is not what I need. I need a replacement video card as I need the video card for my PC. I'll buy a different brand and send this one back to Amazon if that is their support.
Update 11/26/18: Are these cards not any good? Should I return this one for credit and purchase a better card. After purchasing this card, the HDMI slot lost the sound. I contacted the vendor and they wanted it returned for repair. It was only a week or so old. Instead of sending it in, I paid another $9 or so for a DVI to HDMI adapter cable and used the DVI slot on the card. I received sound and pictures for about 3 months and ow the sound has gone out on the DVI slot on the card. I did not want to return it as then my PC is out of video and sound until they take their sweet time to repair a $30 card rather than ship me a new one. This has broken twice so I recommend not to purchase this card for anything as it is junk and the customer support lacks a lot of support."

There was originally only 4GB of RAM on the machine and integrated graphics. It would not even play Fortnite. After adding the graphics card it would play but did lag or would even crash some times. I then upgraded the RAM with an additional 8GB (4GB x 2 sticks) for a total of 12GB. Now he says it plays pretty smooth with no lagging or crashing. He does have the resolution turned down to the lowest setting. It's a $45 card and that's what I would expect, but I don't think he tried to turn it up since adding the RAM. He wasn't looking to build a gaming rig and just needed a better graphics card over what was integrated.

His specs:
Dell Vostro 460
i5 processor
12GB RAM
320GB 7200 RPM HD

I also bought the 4 year warranty on it for $1.54, so he can nuke it and I don't care. :)"

Their quality is great, their cards perform well and their Afterburner software is second to none.

Let's be up front about one thing here: a GT 710 is a GT 710. If you're looking for a gaming card, even just to play Windows Store games, look to at least a 730 or, better, a 750 Ti for entry level gaming.

With that behind us, let's talk about reasonable expectations for a 710. The purpose of a 710 is to give an old computer with no digital video output an HDMI jack. It's to beef up a PC with vintage 2006 integrated graphics and allow it to work with modern displays. It's my expectation that if a graphics card supports a given resolution, be that 1080p, 1440p or even 4k, that it will be capable of smooth video playback at that resolution. I chose this 710 for my HTPC because it supports 4k resolution, and I just needed my ancient PC to push 4k video. That's it.

And here's where this card failed me. 4k video playback was subpar. It was choppy, the HDMI audio cut in and out, and it wasn't just one source. YouTube, local content, it all looked bad. 1080p was much better, but the 4K display did it no favors.

The 710's saving grace was that it was able to push convincing 1080p video to a 1080p monitor, and maybe that's really all it's useful for. If that's your use case, and for plenty of people I'm sure it is, this is a decent, cheap card for you.

Mine was returned. I didn't even bother goofing around with overclocking or temperature testing because I just didn't see a need to. The 710 clearly wasn't quite enough for my needs."
6,1.0,MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 OpenGL 4.5 Single Fan Low Profile Graphics Card (GT 710 2GD3 LP),MSI COMPUTER,NVIDIA,2 GB,1600 MHz,$51.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,Great low cost product with Windows 10 Fall Creator Update (build 1709) Support,"This was a forced purchase under extreme budget limitations. It replaced old ATI HD 4600 series graphics cards which developed issues with dual monitor with the original Windows 10 creators Update and new blue screen issues with the Fall Creators Update. While ATI stopped supporting their product in 2015, Nvidia still releases a solid set of drivers that support the latest version of Windows 10. This MSI version of the GT 710 is very flexible. It supports both low profile (2 slots with brackets included), and standard profile (only 1 slot needed), and is cable of driving 2 HD monitors with ease. Compared to the HD 4650 it was replaced with, the 2d images and text see clearer and the colors more vibrant, even on 15 year old monitors running analog. Even though this is not a gaming card, it holds its own for the light to casual gamer and does not need a lot of power from the PSU to do so."
7,1.0,MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 OpenGL 4.5 Single Fan Low Profile Graphics Card (GT 710 2GD3 LP),MSI COMPUTER,NVIDIA,2 GB,1600 MHz,$51.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,Weak Performance but Does the Job Well,"Inexpensive for a brand new video card. Solid DXVA capabilities for an HTPC. Worked great to replace a dying 7600GS in my dad's computer. Very low power.

Passive cooling might not be enough for this card if you task it alot and have a case with very low airflow. My dad's small form factor PC saw it running in the 80s celsius just running some light games. I attached a slim low-noise 40mm fan to it with a ziptie and that was easily enough to cool it down. Now it never gets above 60*C when playing games for hours. So be aware the cooler is just too small to be a good passive cooler for games and DXVA in a super tight case. In a case with better airflow this is probably less of an issue.

It's paired with a C2D E7500 Wolfdale 2.93Ghz and 8GB DDR-2 800 RAM so not an amazing PC but enough to push this card along well enough. It runs Youtube, Netflix and Media Player Classic with 1080p mkvs smoothly. It has HDMI output which makes it good for our occasional HTPC needs. Again the card does DXVA okay, but not amazingly. Combined with the CPU it's more than enough to handle high bitrate 1080p which is the goal. So for that it's pretty useful despite the low performance. Better at DXVA than the 7600GS by a longshot.

Modern features but very weak performance. Runs older games somewhat worse than the ancient 7600GS it replaced, and newer games just a little better. This card isn't intended for games, but it would be nice to see it perform more like its specs. It's not as disastrous as the GT210 was, with simply broken performance, but it's pretty weak.

That said, it runs Source games okay with the settings scaled back, and runs Battlefield 1942, Call of Duty/UO and lots of other popular older games. My dad uses it to play Rome Total War and Medieval 2 nearly cranked which makes him happy. Runs most lighter-weight newer games with low settings as well. So it's not totally helpless, but it's not meant to compete as a gaming card. AMD's APUs are much faster than this, and the integrated in newer Intel CPUs is also much faster. For my dad's older PC though, this MSI GT710 was a perfectly reasonable replacement part."

Short story. RMA'd the card. Was quickly repaired and sent back to me via Fedex (less then 2 weeks). However MSI didn't bother to ask me if it needed any special instructions return shipping, so it didn't bother to tell Fedex to make sure I signed for it. Fedex said they delivered it (to my door) so I am 100% certain it was stolen (for my neighborhood, thats a big fat DUH). MSI says its not their fault, and that if I had wanted it signed for I should have called and said so. One guy told me that they don't automatically tell Fedex to make sure its signed for because it costs them more to ship it that way.

In short. too bad, your screwed, we didn't follow up on getting proper shipping instructions or even bother to ASK YOU if we should. Its your fault it got stolen, deal with it. Tried to call Corporate HQ multiple times, the secretary is NEVER there, messages go unanswered. 2 months now without a card. Its only a less than $50 card, I know I shouldn't complain, but when you live on SSI/SSDI $50 isn't something i can just ""lose""."

Great for business use!,"I needed a video card quickly to get my office PC back up and running. For some reason, my old video card stopped outputting 3840x2160 @ 30Hz (30 frames/sec), and went back down to 1080p. Because my monitor at the office is 3840x2160, that meant I only had 1/4 as much space for windows, and my productivity was hurting.
My old card, a Radeon HD 5450, required that I use drivers from 2012 to let me drive that video timing out on HDMI. But one fateful day, even the old drivers refused to send it, with no explanation as to why. I also had to rig up a little device to keep the HPD (Hot Plug Detect) signal from going away when I turned my monitor off, or the Radeon would switch to the DVI output. Every. Single. Time. It was really frustrating.
So I went and got this, because I was just looking for a card with the following:
- It outputs 3840x2160 @ 30Hz on HDMI
- It's silent
- Low power
I did about 5 minutes of research, found this, verified on nVidia's website that it would do it (it's spelled out that it will), and whipped out my credit card and hit ""Order Now."" I ordered it on Thursday, and Amazon had it to me on Friday (even though it was normal Prime 2-day shipping). Bonus.
So I crack open my mid-tower, find the old card covered in dust (but it was also a fanless card, and the dust blew right off, no probs), and slap this in. The driver install took ages (gotta have all of those patches and tweaks for games I won't be playing...) and eventually I was back up and running. With this card, 3840x2160 showed up, and was marked as preferred. And when I turn off my monitor and turn it back on again later, it didn't switch to DVI because it decided to. Excellent.
To summarize:
- Works with 2016 drivers in 4K, unlike some other budget cards
- Doesn't decide spontaneously to switch to DVI from HDMI
- I'm happy with it"

Not the best but it'll get the job done.,"This is an older card of course so I can't recommend it for newer gaming. But It can keep up with maybe 80% of my steam library, which has lots of games pre-2016. Just don't expect to do some seriously high-end gaming and you're probably fine. Always check the game's specs and if a card is still in support when looking for what you need.

It was A BUTT to get the screws out to install it into the case because they were in so tight, but everything else about the install went smoothly. We have an HD monitor, and everything looks great. Supports the sound to said monitor as well. NVIDIA drivers are fantastic because they let you know when there's an update unobtrusively and they're very simple to install. Just a few clicks and 1-2 screen flashes and you're done. Supports dual monitors.

This went into a half-tower with an offensively small power supply (300w) so I had to unplug the blu-ray drive but it is working fantastically. For the price, I really have no complaints. It's been working great, and since the card is still in support, you'll continue to get drivers so your games don't crash suddenly. Or cook itself to death, like the card it replaced."

It is not and should not be marketed as a ""gaming"" card. I have a ~2015 Dell Optiplex that has a half-height form factor that I use at my work. The motherboard on the Dell only supports a single VGA output and I really prefer a dual-monitor setup for productivity. I had an old XFX-branded Radeon HD5450 in the case that was doing dual-monitor duty just fine for all this time running Windows 7. When Windows 7 support ended my computer had to be reformatted and a fresh Windows 10 install was done with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled. What we discovered was the BIOS/UEFI changes that were necessary were incompatible with the old Radeon card.

I picked up this GT 710 for a very specific use case. It had to be small-form factor (low-profile brackets), had to be low-power and passively cooled, able to support multiple monitors outputs, and had to support UEFI. This MSi card fit all the criteria. It comes with the standard bracket installed but took a matter of minutes to put the 2 included low-profile brackets on with the correct tools. I installed it in the computer very easily but I was surprised that the card only took up about half of a PCI-e slot. The physical length of the card only occupies the first half of the slot and it doesn't even engage the PCI-e locking mechanism. Once the card is bolted down it doesn't move.

It booted fine and worked for me without any additional drivers. The Nvidia control panel was even added by Windows without any user intervention. I'm running the card with the stock power supply and running two 1080p monitors, one on HDMI and one with DVI-D. So far so good."

Also, it didn't really improve the performance of the desktop. But I wanted a card with a fan/heat sink assembly so it would run cooler. My old card didn't have one and it ran at about 118 degrees F. This one runs about 95 F. I didn't buy this card for gaming just wanted a decent card to run in my old Dell Optiplex desktop. I don't need the low profile adapters. Mine isn't a small form factor. But it is nice to have those if in the future if needed for anther PC. The plastic covers for the ports and connectors is a nice touch.

He tolerated it for months. During a visit he was showing me a funny video and the noise started, then went away.... the computer froze. Well, I don't live there so he told me it does that occasionally. He just restarts and.... um. No! I diagnosed a bad fan on the video card. This card arrived quickly, is easy to install and works great for web surfing and emails. My Dad is thrilled with the whisper quiet function too. At only 2gb of video RAM, I would be careful of what games are played with this card. It may run some newer games but I would guess resolutions and detail may need to be lowered to keep frame rates playable.
Overall though, it's a great value for a quality replacement video card for an average computer and user."

Glitchy video playback was concerning, so I purchased this card to put into the PCI-express slot.

I purchased this card knowing it was low-profile, which was good. It fit right into the case and snapped in without issue. No need to connect anything beyond that and the whole process took 5 minutes.

The card ships with a driver CD. I installed the drivers and the additional software on the CD but ended up removing the additional software as it related to overclocking and I didn't need it.

I like this card as it costs less than fifty bucks and boosts the overall video performance of PCs with integrated graphics. This 2GB card is better than most of the 1GB cards at around the same price point and provides users with the option to have a dual monitor setup. (I'm using the HDMI port and so far, it works great.)

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 12/17/2019:
I just picked up a new HDTV, the Samsung 43"" model UN43NU6900BXZA which offers 4K and UHD. Amazon carries it as does Bestbuy and others locally. It may be a baseline model, but, wow, the pic quality is extremely crisp and clean. The MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB is working perfectly with my new 4K Samsung, using my Mac Pro running Mojave.

This card supports 4K and there was no adjustments in settings needed for setup, the card and my 4K Samsung communicated perfectly and my Mac Pro make the resolution settngs seamlessly in the background upon connecting.
The quality of my Mac Pro now (running Mojave for the present) is stellar. Details, fine text, screen fit, contrast, color...etc...it all looks superb.

If you are considering a 4K display upgrade, YES, this card will work perfectly with it!
---------------------------
I needed an inexpensive card to upgrade my Mac Pro 5.1 mid-2012 and this card works perfectly for that. No power cable needed and a very small profile that won't get in the way of other cards and slots. It is self powered by the PCIe bus so no power cable was needed.

Of course there is no boot screen during boot nor a way to select which drive to boot from if you have more than one OS drive. You can easily though, change the ""start-up"" drive once the OS is booted and loaded in System Preferences, so not a big deal for me.

I am using the HDMI output to a Samsung 1080 HDTV and there was no need to tweak screen fit or anything. The card booted right up to a perfect screen display.

I've tried a few other Apple recommended cards in the past and honestly, none did any better than this. I returned one at over $150 simply because I decided to wait for a lower priced card to do the same thing and this MSI card does! Additionally, this card seems to wake my Mac out of sleep very quickly. The older cards I tried seemed very sluggish to do that, this card seems much more responsive to wake my Mac. A Win-Win in here!

HMDI won't pass the audio, but, no cards out there will do that unless specifically made for a Mac Pro and flashed correctly. I have optical and digital output on my M. Pro so not a biggie.

The card seems responsive and fast and at some point I will do a ""Geekbench"" test. The 1080 on my Samsung HDTV looks crisp and clear output from this card. I would say 1080 looks slightly better on this card than my old OEM one that came installed on my Mac. Small icon seems a bit crisper and clearer. Close to the old card, but, there is definitely a bit of improvement there.

The card is fan cooled and since I won't be gaming with this desktop, it should run very cool routinely.

5 Stars all around and a great way to upgrade an older Mac Pro on the cheap."

I need a high-resolution monitor for imagery and business only. I finally figured out that to get really good resolution for my purposes, you have to go for a gaming video card. I was having lots of problems with my on-board video on a win10 machine with i7 cpu. Was also having problems with my geforce 750 ti card that had worked well at 2560x1440 on my old win7 machine. As it turns out, my problems on the win10 were probably due more to outdated cables. While I was troubleshooting, I picked up this video card for $53. Using a 2.0 hdmi cable with great reviews, this card has worked flawlessly on my win10 machine at 2560 x 1440. I'm now using the 750 ti on my older win7."

I have a separate graphics computer as my monster computer. Blah, blah, blah. The card is really small, and that's good. More heat sync and fan than anything.

It will help encourage me to continue my real reviews of products I've purchased.

Likes: * Really only took 10 mins to install this great video card. * I love that this FANLESS card works flawlessly * Easy installation, took more work researching than actually installing. Had one of my computer wires snag the card initially, but was easily held out of way so the card would fit in slot on motherboard. * Installation videos were spot on providing valuable information. * Love the protective caps provided for shipping and also able to be used after installation to keep dust out of unused monitor outs

Dislikes: * The Heatsink card has slightly slower specs than the fan cooled card. I can live with less specs as heat and noise are major concerns of mine.

Yes I'd buy this card again and recommend to a friend or relative.

Bought this card to get me over the playable threshold. It did, though in order to play I had to turn down many of the game's video intensive features. But for our part, it still looks great and play is great, so I'm not complaining. Perhaps I'd sing a different song if I could see the game played on a high end video card, but since I haven't and we aren't all the big of gamers, we are happy with the outcome.

It's quiet, easy to install, and worked immediately."

First of all, the LPV1 model is physically a PCIe x8 card, but it will in fact work in a x16 PCIe slot. It's very compact and lightweight so even without the use of the locking tab, it shouldn't have any problems staying securely in place.

When I first booted up, the video card was using Microsoft's Basic Display Driver. So I opened up my browser to download the drivers from nvidia. As I was doing that, my monitor flickered on and off, then I saw that Windows automatically installed the driver software and the card switched to my monitor's native resolution. So if this happens to you, just give your Win 10 PC a few minutes recognize the video card and install the correct drivers.

For basic Windows 10 functionality, web browsing, video streaming, and even light casual games under low settings, this card can handle it pretty smoothly. It's passively cooled with no active fan so it stays silent and it has a TDP of only 19W."

For everyone else: This is not a good graphics card for gaming. You're probably looking at this because it's cheap. You get what you pay for. Don't buy this GPU and expect to play games with great graphics quality. That was my Public Service Message. Back to the review. If you're building a CPU mining rig with a Ryzen CPU, you'll need a dedicated GPU. This baby fits the bill perfectly. It's inexpensive, has a passive heatsink which means no fan to wear out and eventually get noisy. The heat sink is quite beefy (card is heavier than it looks) actually keeps the thing nice and cool. It also comes with a low-profile bracket, in case you need to shoehorn it into a 2U server case or maybe a very small PC case. Icing on the cake, it's got 2GB of RAM, will do 4K resolution (at least for displaying graphs) and has all 3 of the major video outputs (VGA, DVI, HDMI). Great picture quality, runs cool, uses almost no power and no noise. I own half a dozen of these and you cannot go wrong."

The graphics worked fine until I installed 2 new Acer 24 inch LED monitors in a dual monitor configuration (extended). My wife uses this machine for doing data entry and other tasks at work. After installing the new monitors, they ""flashed"" or ""blinked"" fairly often. I assumed that the internal graphics system might be getting a bit overloaded so I decided to get this new MSI card. After installing it, the monitors worked great but I noticed that the machine was running slow when I did a right mouse click to get to the graphics configuration. I went ahead and disabled the internal graphics card in the BIOS setup. It was set to ""auto."" Now the right mouse click works great. I installed the latest NVidia software in ""express"" mode and unfortunately, it installed some gaming software. Since we don't do any gaming, I uninstalled everything that wasn't necessary for the display (i.e. drivers only). If I had the install to do over again, I would have installed in advanced mode and unchecked everything but the driver only.

Passmark Performance Test indicated decent processing capabilities but weak scores for 2D and 3D graphics, about 150 each. For this business desktop the number of compatible graphics cards available is limited due to small form factor, power from the OEM 240 watt power supply, plus I wanted HDMI, not DP. The MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit was an easy install using the included SFF bracket requiring about 20 watts power to operate. The MSI software was a 575 Mb download that updated everything. Passmark Performance Test improved with 2D to 220 and 3D graphics to 620. Overall score went from 756 to 1077, a 42% improvement with HDMI monitor. I am pleased with this card and got a lot of bang for the buck."

Tweaking an older HP Win 7 system to run Win 10, I found the poorest performing element was the on-board video capability, or rather, lack of it. The microtower chassis had only one slot on the board and two chassis openings for low profile cards. Because the very compact chassis meant that airflow was poor, I wanted active cooling, even though that would take a few watts of additional power from my seriously undersized 240W PSU.

Although some specs say this needs a 300W PSU, I finally found that this unit generally draws under 20W and since i had only 1 chassis fan, no lights, an efficient, cool running but not SSD HDD, and no additional add-in cards, it seemed a match. With 2 GB of RAM vs. other 1GB versions, this is the best low power performer I found. Any games played are older, and I have left everything at factory settings. Win 10 drivers were easy to install and rock solid. I have not had a single flicker or resolution hiccup in the well over a month period since purchase. Running the latest win 10 builds without any issues. Far from a barn burner, but fine for general computing and way better than the on-board chipset it replaced. The HDD is now the bottleneck, which I bought for size, not speed. Recommended where low profile, low power, and moderate performance demands are your criteria."

I am not a newbie when it comes to upgrading computers. I knew that I wasn't buying a top of the line card, and I've had Nvidia cards before. I bought this mostly to take advantage of its SUPPOSED 4k capabilities for my new MSI 4k monitor, and to do some pretty light video editing. This card has been very frustrating. I've tried soooo much to fix this thing.

I've even tried it in two different computers.

Specs on computer 1: Intell quad core 3.2GB, 24GB ram.
Specs on Computer 2 (brand new HP): AMD Ryzen quad core 3.1GB, 16GB ram.

The results were the same.

Sometimes I need two video sources open at the same time, playing simultaneously. These video sources are usually local, but occasionally they are streaming. On both computers using this card, whenever I have a video open in VLC and another in WMP, there is terrible stutter and pixel loss. Moving my mouse when ONE video source is playing causes stuttering. Audio and video won't sync properly. If I'm watching a streaming video, I can't also scroll Twitter or Facebook because an autoplay video will completely wreck the streaming video. Plex is as solid a program as any out there, and anytime I try to use Plex to watch local video on this card I get stuttering and audio/video sync issues.

I have a hard-wired 100GB connection, so the stuttering isn't my internet connection.

I had a very old Nvidia card (2GB) that handled all of this really well, including heavy video editing and video compositing. I'm not doing that work much anymore, but the idea that I should try anything like that with this card makes me jiggle with laughter - when I'm not crying for dropping $70 on this thing.

Reached out the Nvidia support. They got right back to me. Gave me complicated instructions to put the right driver on my system. It worked, for a while. When things started to go south again I asked for a replacement, but apparently I have to work with MSI to get a replacement. That will be my next step.

Just beware that this card might not handle basic functions.

ADD: I hooked my monitors up to the onboard graphics of the new HP and everything works fine. This card is now officially junk to me."

Solution is in last paragraph if you don't want to read about my trials and tribulations.

My pc has only VGA and HDMI for monitor output, and the HDMI quit working. I wanted to have a dual monitor setup and I had an empty PCIe slot, so I figured I'd get a graphics card. My main monitor was VGA and I was hoping to get the 2nd (an old monitor I brought from work so I could work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic) into HDMI. Got the card inserted into the slot and powered everything back up. BLACK SCREEN!!! Not even the integrated graphics VGA worked! I had no clue what to do! I powered down, took the graphics card back out and was able to see via the VGA again.

The product did not come with a cd for the driver, so I went to the NVIDIA website to download it. Got the .exe going, but it wouldn't let me run the install wizard because it couldn't detect the card. (Nooo duhhh...because I had to take the card out to even SEE how to get to the website to download the driver!!!) Only the integrated graphics showed up under display in Device Manager.

I thought that maybe my HDMI cable was bad so I tested them out with the laptop. They worked great. Turns out the old monitor from work was no good. Back to the drawing board. I scoured tons of forums for solutions and pored over them for hours.

One solution was to boot up in safe mode and enable the PCIe slot in BIOS. So, I go to BIOS and there is absolutely NOTHING about graphics, video interface, northbound or southbound (or whatever it is) settings...NOTHING. Spent about an hour trying to read up on BIOS and where else it could possibly be. Couldn't find a thing. So I decided to look up if I should update my BIOS. After all, I was running version A04. I got conflicting answers about whether or not I should - this did not really help me at all.

I tried to find out how I could even update the BIOS...I didn't know where to go. My search led me to Dell's website, where I input the service code of my pc and it showed me about 11 different updates it needed to do - one of which was a BIOS marked URGENT! Matter of fact, it was wanting to update to BIOS version A11!!! No WONDER I was having trouble! Intel's website told me, if I understood it correctly, that I could not use an external graphics card in addition to the integrated graphics card...that only one would be active. That bummed me out because in order to make the graphics card fit, I had to take off the VGA port and install it with the smallest bracket, which only left me with HDMI and DVI. I was hoping to use the integrated VGA and the HDMI on the new graphics card.

Solution: I updated my BIOS to the latest version, enabled Intel Multi-Display in BIOS, and was then able to continue the NVIDIA control panel installation, which enabled my new graphics card. I was also able to use the integrated VGA AND the HDMI on the new graphics card with no trouble! Hopefully, this poor sap is able to help another poor sap out. :)

Con: My only con (other than the legwork required for me to install it - but that is most likely due to my pc being old) is that the fan is noisier than I expected."

 I'm a software dev by day and music producer by night. I used to build high-performance, water cooled PC's for benchmarking competitions years ago, so I know a thing or two about buying computer parts. This past week, I ordered parts and built a mid-budget Micro ATX PC exclusively for producing music. In doing so, I wanted an absolutely dead silent computer. I have a Sterling condenser microphone (for vocal recording) that will pick up birds through walls miles away, so the fans gotta be silent. My build has a very quite and low-power consuming i3 9100f as well as two super quiet Noctua case fans. I very carefully picked out (most) of these parts to build a dead-silent PC. Obviously I made a slip up on this graphics card....

I'm not gaming on this thing, but I did want something that can easily handle 1080p on a 21"" monitor as well as potentially support a second monitor, so I bought a budget-end graphics card. Upon reading benchmarks and researching, I've seen good things about the performance out of the GT 710 graphics card. It's awesome that includes 2GB of memory, just a lot of bang for your buck in a daily PC. So I ordered this one. I've had MSI products in the past, including graphics cards, such as the higher-end Radeon HD 7950 graphics cards, which was an awesome GPU in the early 2010's.

I fired up my PC after building. I instantly noticed the sound of a noisy fan constantly running (which infuriated me, as I was trying to go for a dead silent build...). It didn't take me long to figure out it was the graphics card. It is VERY noisy. It sounds like it's running a game constantly with just my desktop open! To demonstrate the noise, I have recorded a video clip. I used MSI Afterburner in the clip to manually adjust the fan speed. As you can see, I have it on the lowest setting in the beginning. I can't lower it anymore, so the fan will always be audible, even at the lowest level. I turned it on max, and you can hear what it would sound like running a game.

I'm honestly shocked how horrendously noisy this graphics card is for it's size. It has a very tiny fan, what looks like a 40mm fan (maybe even smaller). The noise wasn't even something I considered in my research on this card, I did not thing such a low powered card with such a tiny fan would be so noisy! Does it run? It runs great. Desktop is fast and responsive, I have no problem watching videos or movies on it (which I tested). But I CANNOT recommend this graphics card. The noise level is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care if you're building this for a gaming machine, media center, or something else where you didn't think noise would be a factor. This thing is noisy, and every time you shut you PC, you will notice just how bad it is. Shame on you, MSI. I know this is a budget level graphics card, but there is no excuse for this kind of noise.

I'm returning this and replacing it with an Asus GeForce GT 710. same card, but it has a special Asus-designed heatsink with NO FAN. As long as you have adequate cooling like my PC, with good airflow and cable management, you don't need dedicated fan on something like this."

The actual product box was not sealed nor did it have anything else in it except the videocard and the small form brackets. I wondered if it was an open item but the video card seems wrapped from the factory. I downloaded the software from MSI before install. It was a straight forward install and I connected my monitor up to the VGA for now and booted right up with no issues in Windows 10. I ran the GEFORCE software and it download drivers and updated again. 500megs later the card was installed with no issues. I plan to run another monitor in the very near future and this was the cheapest I could find but it seems like a nice budget card. I have not been into gaming for 15 years or more so I'm sure gamers would want more nowadays. It did speed up my computer by freeing up the motherboard CPU and RAM. I'm very happy with it.

It was installed on a PCIe x16 slot, although it uses a x8 bus. I used a DVi-to-HDMI adapter to connect it to the ViewSonic monitor, which also gave me sound on this monitor. I used the Linux proprietary driver nvidia-driver-435. I could get 4K resolution at 60hz on the Philips monitor (3840x2160@59.94hz on Philips and 2560x1440@59.95hz on ViewSonic) but I ended up using lower resolutions (2560x1440@59.95hz on both). The glmark2 benchmark gave me a pitiful 591 score, which is low for some games (my 5-year old Quadro 600 gave me a 914 score for the same setup) but is OK for a professional workstation. When I run the glmark2 benchmark, the temperature jumped from 56C to 69C, which I guess is OK for a low profile card without a fan."

I bought this card because I have to remote into a PC via RDP and run software on it. All was well until I wanted to run a game that required a relatively modern DirectX and my system didn't support it.

I didn't want to spend a lot and this was not a hugely graphics-intensive game. I just needed modern DirectX support that would work in a remote connection.

I also didn't want a power guzzling, heat pumping, fan noise-generating video card.

Looking around I found this card at under $55 (at the time of purchase) and it supported DirectX 12. It supports PCI Express 2.0 (yup my PC is a bit long in the tooth) and has VGA, DVI Dual Link, and HDMI so I'm not feeling trapped (other than no display port but what the heck are you going to get for <$55).

Install it, load NVIDIA drivers (they self update after that), and I'm all done. Games work remotely now!

So, if you need a low-end card to support more modern things, you can do worse than this card. I have no complaints and no reservations about giving it a thumbs up."

Update: 06-27-2018 still working great on my desktop PC running windows 8.1x but... now and then I have had top reboot. I recently got windows monthly roll up quarterly updates. Closed all programs, installed and rebooted. Then I noticed all windows / programs were solid black. I rebooted and the problem was gone. At other random times I have have had a single program do this. Never happened in the prior 8 years I have owned this computer and running the built in graphics on the core i3 chop. Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of.

Low power consumption!! I used my kill-a-watt meter and on one computer the power consumption was identical to the core i3 with built in video and on the computer I am using now it is around 3 to 5 watts extra at idle compared to before I installed the video card. Running temperature is very cool - I ran the MSI torture test and put my hand on the fan-less heat sink and it was barely warm! Normally it is room temperature.

Excellent. I don't play video games but I do some home video editing with Corel VideoStudio but.... I started using a program called Sketchup (SU) which is used to for architectural building design and 3D modeling in general. The problem is the latest and last two free versions of the program SU 2016 and SU2017 require a newer version of OpenGL. My OpenGL my existing home built computer is a Intel first generation core i3 socket LGA1156 computer with an MSI MS-7587 H57M ED65 chip set motherboard that only supports OpenGL 2.0. I discovered that I could not simply download software driver with a newer version of OpenGL because the hardware I had would not support it. So I started searching for a video card. I had no Idea what card would work but amazingly I discovered that my 7+ year old computer supported PCIE or PCI-E 16X 2.0 which meant I could use almost any video card including this one.

Install.... I highly recommend using backup software that makes a full image of your computer as this is the mother of all installs! I used ghost to backup my windows 8.1 install. I rebooted and then started the install. Wow I was blown away with the size of the driver 1.5 Gigabytes!!!!! WOW - largest driver I have ever installed. Normally, a driver might be a few megabytes!

Next, it asked if I wanted to install the updates. I should have said no and rebooted then installed updates. Result - when I rebooted the screen was blank. I hit the power switch and rebooted and everything is fine. About a day later I had my android phone hooked up by usb to transfer pictures and I disconnected because the copy froze and I was forced to reboot. That problem never happened and fortunately has not happened since.

CONS: invasive - huge huge driver install. I normally, run about 7 programs and tons of tabs in my firefox browser. I minimize everything and set my computer to go to sleep after 20 min and hibernate after 2 hours. When I start the computer up after hibernating and open the programs minimized to the task bar then are reduce in size about 1/3 of the screen and aligned in the top left corner so I have to resize the window. Never had the problem until I installed the video card but I can live with it.

Second con - there is zero performance improve in my system even when using VideoStudio X9. The only thing the video card does for me is allow me to run SketchUp 2017. Possibly I might run dual monitors in the future. The point is that the power and features of the card mainly apply to video games and possibly VR? but for the average desktop user you won't notice a difference with this card or any other brand."

First off, I'm not a gamer. I just needed a second graphics card so I could use 3 monitors simultaneously. Being fanless is important to me because I use my PC for mixing/recording music and don't want additional noise. Finding a fanless card that supports 3 monitors simultaneously is tough to find. (Amazon doesn't help because they combine questions and reviews for similar models and if the answer/review doesn't explicitly spell out the product model you get conflicting results. For that matter, even the manufacturer specs say ""Maximum Displays: 2"".

I bought this to run side by side with a Saphire Radeon 6450 which will only handle 2 monitors simultaneously. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got it and the box said it supported 3 monitors max. So I replaced the Radeon, installed the drivers and control panel software and 3 monitors worked great.

Things to note:
1) Windows 10 Pro would not configure 3 monitors from the traditional right-click | Display settings. I had to first use the Nvidia Control panel to tell the card to use 3 monitors simultaneously. Once that was done then Windows could see and manage all 3.

2) For some reason Windows popped a message that Nvidia Control Panel needed to be downloaded from the Windows Store. Comments on the Windows Store indicate that makes LOTS of folks VERY unhappy with Nvidia. I did not download it but just searched for it on my machine and it was there. I think Nvidia drivers did install it but Windows didn't know that until it ran once.

3) The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that when this card is installed my boot time goes from 15 seconds to nearly 2 minutes. With my old card I get a single system beep from POST then it boots. With this card I get 3 addition POST beeps each approximately 30 seconds apart. I've gotten quick response from MSI Support and will revise the rating should a solution come from it."

With enough memory, this PC is easily powerful enough for day to day tasks but because it is 2nd generation, the built in intel graphics do not support some of the requirements for games these days (e.g. Fortnite can't run on it, and Minecraft will stop supporting it this fall)
This $35 upgrade made it very possible for her to continue playing these games with her friends at a decent quality (you won't impress anyone with it's awesomeness and get 120fps on high graphics settings -- not by a long shot! but graphic cards that can do that easily cost $300-$800!)

Will this card satisfy an advanced gamer? NO!
Will it make it possible to continue playing decently on an older computer that would be under the minimum requirements? Sure!

Another 2 huge plusses:
- It does not consume a lot of power so our existing (~300W) power supply was more than enough
- It uses only passive cooling! no fan needed = no additional noise at all!"

I installed it promptly into my computer. Installation was easy and upon boot it was instantly recognized by Ubuntu 16.04 and then I installed the proprietary Nvidia drivers and began testing it out. Unsurprisingly within the first 15 minutes of testing the card overheated and caused the computer to shut down. I had to install a fan to keep it cool which is not such a big problem for me because I had the parts laying around, but if I was a typical user I would have had to spend another $15 on an additional cooling fan and have to wait another week for delivery. Overall it does what I wanted to do. I only play Cities: Skylines and my kids play the Sims. Would I buy it again? Probably not. Would I recommend it to anyone? Unlikely. If I find myself needing to buy a new card in the future, I'll definitely be buying the step above in the 90 to 100 dollar range.
UPDATE!!! Thinking about it, this graphics card doesn't do as advertised. It is supposed to be passively cooled card. It is not. I'm knocking it down to 2 stars."

A decent, basic, energy efficient Nvidia video card that is a smart upgrade from an onboard GPU or an old basic video card that's no longer supported. And the 2 GBs of dedicated memory is a bonus. The GT 710 is not a gaming card and it's not supposed to be. Then again, most folks who own personal computers aren't gamers. I replaced an old GT 220 which was no longer supported.

Installation was easy (in my full sized tower) and Linux Mint (19.1) picked up the new card immediately and updated the driver accordingly. Windows 7 Pro, however, booted up at the low resolution (as to be expected being Windows) and I had to download the latest driver for the 710 from the Nvidia drivers page online. Once downloaded and installed, one reboot was all that was required and resolution was back to normal.

It's very quiet and is reported as drawing only a max of 20 watts. Like I said, the card is not meant for serious gamers but for the majority of folks it does exactly what it's supposed to do."

I didn't like the on board graphics as you can't change the resolution as its greyed out so I bought a Gigabyte graphics card with a passive heat sink that took up 2 spaces. Now 2 years on I wanted to fit a 1tb SSD as the boot time was slow but the MB had no more sata sockets. No problem, I bought a PCIe dual sata card for the 1 tb HDD but the gigabyte card covered the slot with its heat sink. Hence this long story to buying this MSI graphics card thats only 1 slot wide. I note other users had problems getting the driver and my card had no driver disk but luckily last night I searched the internet to find the driver for Win 10. Its on the Nvidia website and the file name is 446.14-desktop-win10-64bit-international-dch-whql. I extracted it, installed it and within 5 minutes after a restart all was well.

Hope this helps others especially the source for the driver. As for performance, I'm not interested in high end gaming so it isn't a big deal."

The card I received looked brand new, although the one I bought didn't come with a manual, none was needed as installation was a breeze with the card fitting easily into the available PCI slot. Upon boot up Windows 10 booted into a basic graphics driver with low resolution and so I went into device manager to have Windows 10 check for driver updates and it downloaded and installed the proper drivers. I was then able to switch the resolution to 2560x1440 which looks great and so I'm happy with this purchase."

Consequently, the GPU continually overheated and shut the PC down.

A temporary clip-on fan provided temporary cooling that was sufficient, and the permanent solution was a 50mm chassis fan screwed to the fins. Fortunately, the card in the next slot was very short, left the fins exposed, and there was room for the fan.

It was installed in a Win 7 machine upgraded to Win 10. The on-board graphics were not supported in Win 10, so the card was needed. The machine had been deemed too slow for Win 10, but with this card it is actually more responsive under Win 10 than it was under Win 7 with on-board graphics. Not to mention that it is driving a Dell U2518D monitor in 2560x1440 mode (via HDMI) and is super sharp. The machine is not used for gaming, so I can't comment on its speed, but I would guess it is not blazing fast."

My motherboard only has PCI Express 1, and x16 slot. No problems. Going from 128-bit memory interface to 64-bit didn't seem to be an issue.

One is to cover a current monitor which has a top resolution of 1920x1200. But, the embedded Intel video graphics in my PC sometimes resets it to 1920x1080 which I then have to jump through hoops to change. This cards fixes that problem with little cost.

The second purpose allows me to go to a higher resolution with a new 4K monitor and give the older monitor to my wife. She'll need the same upgrade.

I did this on a Dell 3250 PC running an Intel i5 processor and a limited power supply. I worry that I might be overloading the supply but no problems after a few weeks."

It is not in the least. Instead, MSI got cheap and shortened the card size. This shorter version does NOT engage the safety lock on the motherboard and you cannot remove the VGA mini adapter because the heat sink is glued and screwed in place. In addition, I saw that the card does not seat 'perfectly' where it should screw down, which is a huge issue if you have a case where a metal plate presses down to secure 'all in 1' add-in cards, such as a custom InWin thin case or other brands, like Dell and HP. This places a huge threat if you are shipping systems or sell these to customers. This is pure IGNORANCE on MSI design engineers, whose IQs may be high, but have demonstrated an alarming and repeating lack of 'builder' common sense. I also found the same kind of flaws in their 9th gen motherboard connector layouts that made the boards useless for my purposes. I can't fit second video cards in low profile cases because they moved the USB 3 Port to the side of the board where it prevents cards from being fully inserted, making the board useless for two video card solutions. What was MSI thinking?"

The HDMI output (3840 x 2160 resolution @ 30 Hz) matches my system and my needs perfectly. A more expensive card with higher performance would have just been overkill, since I am not into gaming or watching movies on this PC.

I was concerned that the card might run hot with passive fanless cooling, but I was pleasantly surprised...the heatsink barely gets warm, and the silent operation in my home studio is a big plus (and I don't have to worry about a fan getting noisy and eventually dying).

As others have mentioned, there was no disk with driver software, but I easily downloaded the driver software from the Nvidia website, and actually didn't want any of the MSI overclocking or utilities anyway.

Low profile, low power, low price and silent ! I am very happy with this card !"

The first driver download from NVidia for the XP 64 bit OS would not accept the hardware so it refused to install. So I downloaded a 32 bit Win XP driver from NVidia and it installed after flashing a warning screen first then proceeded with the install without any problems. The card runs as smoothly as the other one that I bought previously for a Dell desktop upgraded to Win 10 Pro.
The main snag that some people seem to be having with this card is the install procedure. With the computer off, unplug the video cable from the desktop, install the card, plug the video cable into the card then turn on the computer. After booting, run the NVidia driver for the operating system you are using and the driver will install. You must have a video cable plugged into the card before booting the computer. You cannot preinstall the driver before installing the card.
The card is not expensive and uses only a small amount of power that my 300 watt power supply provides."

He was, after all, not using a graphics card because I had taken it out when it malfunctioned and connected the monitor directly to the integrated VGA port. I just hadn't figured it would really make any difference... boy was I wrong! So after maybe 2 years of just being connected to the motherboard, I finally purchased this cheap little graphics card, and what a difference it made! Now, my son loves playing his online games and they play fast and smooth with no lag! I also upgraded his drive to a new Samsung 970 EVO SSD and the computer boots up in under a minute!

This is not a Gaming card, at least not cutting edge games. I bought it for a PC that I will turn into a home file server and I am happy with it.
Up Date 10/16/2028
Well I only removed one star since I was not surprised that it has trouble with 4K (3840X2160) video I expected it wouldn't do well. It does render static images well what I removed the star over is how hot it runs since it has no fan.
I will save anyone thinking about 4K video who needs a LP card some time. As of this posting date you want a GeForce GTX 1650 D6 OC Low Profile 4G Graphics Card using the GDDR6 RAM. I spent a lot of time comparing LP video cards and that's the one with the best performance I found. Still won't be a great gaming card but it will power via the PCIe slot and will be a lot better than the one above. Of course it's 3X the cost also."

Changing the regular back plate to two low profile back plates was easy. The 2 GB model uses the full width of the PCI Express slot. BIOS and Windows 10 64 bit started using it from the connected DVI port right away. Windows found an Nvidia driver and automatically installed it 8 minutes after booting. Full device and installation took about an hour, with most of it spent waiting for software from MSI and Nvidia's websites to install and update. It's cool to see YouTube videos looking like 60 fps, full color demos at electronics stores. It is a great upgrade from integrated graphics, which struggled with 30 fps 720p streaming video.

The box says the 300 watt power supply requirement is based on a PC with an Intel Core i7 3.2 GHz processor. That's a 130 watt CPU, so my PC with a 65 watt dual core CPU will be fine. The card only needs 19 watts, presumably if it is running 3 monitors at once with detailed game content.

I'm not a gamer, so I doubt the card will ever hit its maximum performance level. I just want smooth video playback, multiple monitor support for my refurbished PC, and the ability to connect to HDMI displays. The card uses a full size HDMI port. A large cable from a DVD player was inserted to confirm it wasn't mini or micro HDMI.

The card was well packaged. It had protective red plastic covers on the connectors. Installing and running 64 bit Blender 2.78c happened nicely without OpenGL support error messages it used to display with integrated Intel G41 graphics. The 3D editing view was very fast and smooth. To my surprise and delight, CUDA and GPU rendering in the Cycles renderer were available. I enabled it and set the tiles to 256x128 with experimental features turned on (256x256 slowed down the Windows interface). It worked much quicker than CPU rendering. Wow. It was my impression that GTX400 and above cards were needed for that. Amazing!

Update after one month of use: Changed review from 5 to 2 stars. Windows 10 64 bit stops working several times a week with Kepler Live Kernel Event 141 errors. They usually happen while web browsing with two dimensional text and graphics. This hardware isn't PC compatible. No other graphics card or integrated graphics system has ever behaved like the GT 710. There was also terrible mouse lag and mouse cursor disappearance when the card was connected to a 1080p HDTV. It's really annoying to have the display turn black when I'm right in the middle of regular office tasks. I am losing data and having to redo work because of this garbage hardware.

- - -

4 month update. Lowered rating to one star. It should be -100 stars. The card is still having live kernel event code 141 hardware errors once or twice per day. The driver has been repeatedly updated. Clean installs were done. Windows 10 is fully updated. Power management is set to ""prefer maximum performance."" Quick boot is disabled in BIOS. The computer's power plan is set to high performance. Nothing has helped. If anything, the problems are worse than they were four months ago. I hate this product. It can't reliably handle the taxing situation of displaying a web page while the mouse is moving.

-----------

Final update on day 479 (16 months). It gave a livekernelevent code 117 while attempting to play a YouTube video to a 1360x768 HDTV over HDMI. Everything was fine until it froze, got blocky, and went black. Now the card is removed and in the garbage. I am back to using integrated G41 graphics and an SVGA cable. I had upgraded to the latest Nvidia driver and it apparently had no positive effect. Repasting the GPU had no positive effect. Replacing the power supply did not help. I need order and stability in computer hardware, not chaos, failure, errors, and problems with no solutions. I regret purchasing an MSI and an Nvidia product. Both companies clearly have no clue about making decent hardware, doing quality control, or telling the truth to patient customers who simply want working machines."

I plugged it into an Acer Aspire AM3470G-UW10P (circa 2012) with 8G RAM running Ubuntu 18.04. Since I already had the proprietary NVIDIA drivers loaded it was detected without further configuration.

Update: I can’t seem to get any output from VGA

Update: This card did not work with my RX 560 also installed. Will have to return unfortunately. The main reason being that the vga will not output video meaning I only have 2 monitors.

Obviously its not a gaming card and is DEFINITELY a budget card but it is capable and can do even more if overclocked with something like MSI tuner. There are not alot of performance small form factor cards out there but for around $50 if you are looking for something to get the job done than here it is. Obviously its not a 760 or a 970 (my other cards in my other builds I run) but I would buy this again.

I put this in a old slimline Dell Optiplex that i decided to upgrade and use primarily for a media pc in the gameroom. I first put a intel q9650 (quad @ 3ghz) , upped the ram ddr2 to 6gb, then threw this gpu in. Ran great! Decided to load a game and see how it does. Dishonored on high settings is at a stable 30fps.

I figured that if the fan quit the card would overheat and quit, probably at some critical moment. So I got the MSI version of the GT 710, which installed easily in the slot previously occupied by the 620. I restarted the computer, which temporarily reverted to its built-in minimal graphics display. I then went to the NVIDIA web site, found the driver package for this replacement card, downloaded it, and ran it. It quickly installed the new driver, and the screen reverted to the settings I had created under the 620. You can go to the MSI site for the driver, but it will simply refer you to the NVIDIA site. There is no CD provided with a driver, probably because NVIDIA frequently updates its drivers, so downloading assures you get the most recent version."

I'm not a gamer so no need for for a high $$ card. I purchased this as an upgrade to the integrated graphics card on an older Dell machine. Using newer and larger monitors, some software programs wouldn't display all that well and had some weird artifacts with the graphics rendering. This card solved that problem and now everything appears nice and clean just as it should. Definitely a nice card that won't break the bank for a basic upgrade to an older machine. I also purchased this because it' supports HDMI which I had much rather use than VGA. It was an easy install on Windows 7 Pro 64.

I could not actually test out the product, since it wasn't compatible with my system, and and I did not want to give them a 1 star.

Check your motherboard BIOS before ordering this product. For HP computers, if it's 2011 or older, there is a good chance that it is a legacy BIOS, and will not have the option to switch from an internal graphics card, to a dedicated graphics card. I had to return this item, for that reason.

Graphics card installed fine, but PC would not boot pass startup screen. Could not even access the BIOS menu.
Once the card was removed, the PC booted normally."

This just fits with the riser card. Runs at 39-40c and works great under Fedora 33 Linux. Beware - there are two cards. I bought the one on the left for another machine. It has a fan and is great. I hit the order another and got the one on the right. It doesn't have VGA or Display port. The heat sink one runs too hot and will not work in the 1U server. Ensure you get the fan one. They shipped the wrong one. After exchanging it now resides in my 1U and encodes many video files and is so much better than the Matrox VGA onboard card. It has low voltage draw and works with the 200w power supply in the server. Also works great in an HPE-1360t as a replacement for the nVidia 630 which burned out after 7 years.

I basically threw this card in, got driver's and just left it in the system for a year.
A few things to note, one this is a low profile card that seems to be meant to be put in to a server like setup, and not for gaming purposes. The second thing to note is that this card is actually a PCI-E x8 card, not a PCI-E x16 card as it's currently labeled as. On top of that the specs are also listed incorrectly, the clock core is around 800mhz, not the listed 950mhz, the GPU ram speed is also listed about 100mhz above what it actually runs at. This card does state it supports DirectX 12, which is semi true, however it only seems to actually utilize DirectX 11 and seems to almost emulate DirectX 12 compatibility.
Other than that the card is perfect for light YouTube/ web browsing, or really old game's from around 2003 and below.
The card can be semi overcocked, but don't expect to get much more then what it runs at out of the box."

As any long time user knows drivers can be a source of frustration (thankfully that's gotten much better in recent years).

With support for an older integrated chipset dropped in current versions I was unable to upgrade an otherwise suitable machine. This was a simple drop in solution that was immediately identified and supported everything needed for a 1080p display with Kubuntu Cosmic.

If you're looking at this card you're not looking for 4k, gaming, or high performance. You're looking for functional upgrade for functional older equipment. Reliable product from a trusted manufacturer at a reasonable price. This will be my go-to solution for any such need while available."

I ordered a Geoforce 710 to replace it. Initially, the 710 card was not recognized by my system (Dell XPS 8500). After a few reboots, it was finally recognized and the driver got installed. After a half-hour operation, the screen got snowy and the system hung, requiring a reboot. It happened several times. I have taken the board out and am using the builtin display interface until I get a different graphics card.

Nvidia is a reputable name in this area. I am not sure why this was happening. Either the card was bad or maybe the 710 power needs are more than my power supply can handle. But that is unlikely in a big desktop system."

Observations: used in a Windows 10 Build 1909 desktop. All security and cumulative updates installed. Many reviews (here and other sites) said that the card was not Windows 10 compatible. I purchased and installed to see what would “really” happen. Boot process was nominal but slow due to the hard wired AMD 45 Series Dual Core E1-1500 APU (CPU/GPU combo) on the motherboard and the installation of the generic Windows 10 driver updates. Once it finished loading the Windows 10 Basic Video Driver (2006 version), the computer stabilized nicely and performed within MB specifications (it’s most definitely NOT a gaming rig). The video card also fixed a persistent onboard GPU heat stress problem (95° C/197° F) that used only a passive heat sink (I had previously pulled the sink, applied new thermal paste with absolutely no improvement) by automatically disabling the onboard GPU and automatically enabling the PCIe 2.0 x16 expansion slot as I’d hoped and expected. Then I loaded the latest Nvidia driver for GeForce GT 710 2G3D LP series cards (with fan) from the Nvidia website (per the MSI website directions). There was absolutely no problems installing & running the 64-bit version of the driver. I also updated the Windows 10 basic video driver (2019 version) as backup (for MB GPU; no plans to use it unless there is a catastrophic failure of the MSI card).
Conclusion and recommendation: Another quality product from MSI. Don't hesitate to use this card on older desktops that have an onboard fixed GPU as a viable upgrade solution. The low profile (LP) kit comes with the pictured default standard full height bracket (4.2 inches). There are also two LP brackets (3.118 inches) that can be substituted (like I did) requiring two LP slots if you need to use the VGA 15-pin socket. The Dual-link DVI and HDMI connectors are paired to the primary bracket; the VGA connector tied via the ribbon cable to the video card board and is secured on the second bracket using the existing video plug female fasteners. I did not test the DVI or HDMI connectors as the monitor my client uses is VGA only, so I can't comment on usability/compatibility or any issues that may occur."

Pros: Build quality is superior. Easy to install. Comes with extra expansion slot covers. Cons: it worked for 2-3 days without any software install. Then windows 10 crashed and got stuck in reboot mode. Spoke to Nvidia support, they suggested that I clear out “possibly” faulty software and do a complete reinstall. That didn’t work, computer screen continued to flicker and random shut downs continued. Someone suggested my power supply might not be sufficient. I checked my PC, it had 350W power supply. This was purchased for Dell Studio 540 with Intel Core 2 Quad 8300 processor. Turns out the BiOS is from 2009. This card won’t function with bios from 2011 or before. I have no use for the card, I removed it and my PC works great, but I don’t have Dual Monitor function anymore."

Replaced old GPU on old rig that I built in 2015 - if it ain't broke

2. Works right outta the box but missing driver cd so it will fudge up your display set up until drivers are downloaded which you have to go online for - this was not fun but whatevs

3. So far works great and haven't had a blue screen of death so far since old gpu fan stopped working and I couldn't find a new fan replacement - just changed the whole darn thing out.

4. I also used IObit driver booster pro to update all drivers on rig in case there is a hardware/software glitch conflict which causes issues in the future - preemptive but yolo

I use my PC to maintain two web sites, watch movies, television and listen to music. I needed HDMI video output to feed my monitor which my PC's motherboard did not provide. So I was looking for an inexpensive video card. Not only was this video card among the most inexpensive it was made by the same company as my motherboard, MSI. The other thing I liked about the card is that unlike other video cards it used no cooling fan. It used a large heat sink. Thus, keeping he noise level down.

With all MSI products, the build quality is excellent and beyond reproach. I strongly suggest this card if you only need a light duty graphics card."

When I open windows which cause a large white area to suddenly appear the whole display goes dark for a couple of seconds, then recovers. I see on the internet that others have experienced the same issue. I tried all the solutions suggested and some improved the situation but none cured it. Finally the card started to show lines on the display and little floaters. I knew its days were numbered. I looked again and this card still looked like the best option. Maybe I got a lemon? There was a newer model. So I bought the newer one and it still blacks out, although much less. So far nothing else has gone wrong."

I moved to a 4K TV as a monitor (Oh wow what a game changer) and needed to add a video card to support it. Just like having 4 monitors but without the mechanical borders around the screens. Instead of 40 lines, I can now have 90 lines of code up at once (and have two columns of code and one column of board schematics and layout). My work system seems archaic compared to my home system now. This video card has performed very well.
I had to reinstall the software a couple of times (which is a very manual process) and on advice switched to AMD Radeon series which is fully supported with the default Fedora Linux install.
Nothing wrong with the GT 710 hardware, just the software support is poor so I am down-grading my rating."

I didn't have time to test it on any other Linux distro's.

I bought this for a server running OpenSUSE Linux Leap 42.3, but I had regular problems with either the system completely crashing or the mouse and keyboard freezing while the system kept running. I tried installing Nvidia proprietary drivers to replace the default drivers, but I still had problems.

I've been using Nvidia GPU's on older OpenSUSE servers for nearly a decade without a problem. The problem appears to me to be an incompatibility with current OpenSUSE versions rather than a defect in the card itself, because when I tested it by installing OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 (which is newer than Leap 42.3, despite the numbering), the install process gave me a warning that the card was incompatible.

I was happy with this GPU other than the crashing and freezing. Graphic quality was good for such a cheap card - though I'm not sure how great it would be for gaming - and the power draw was very low. I tested it with a Kill-A-Watt meter and the system's power consumption over four hours was exactly the same as with the Asus P9D-E 4L motherboard's integrated graphics."

This is a half size card but the card comes with the full size plate installed. In the box were two half-sized plates. You'll need to unscrew the full sized plate (4 screws, can be untwisted with a flat nose plier) and then attach the two plates (one for the HDMI and the slot next to it, one for the VGA port) to the card. Then voila, it can be installed easily.

The card works great. Tested with some Steam games, the framerate and resolution is very much improved.

I didn't need anything too fancy, so this card seemed perfect. For video purposes, it absolutely is! Not only does my PC not crash almost everytime I try to play a more resource-heavy game now (it actually doesn't crash at all anymore), but I can actually up the video settings to the highest levels in the games I actually do play.

The reason I only gave it 2 stars is due to the severe sound problems this card causes. I spent days going through various forums and trouble shooting processes to get my microphone to work again and it just won't anymore. Somehow this card makes my computer unable to even recognize my microphone now. Not only that, but sound in general has become an issue. Many times when I open a game or other app, there is no sound. I have to unplug my hdmi cord until the sound comes back and when I plug it back in, sometimes it stays on, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it doesn't come on at all. Sometimes it works just fine. Very frustrating. Again, I spent several days and frustrating hours trying to fix this but could find nothing. If you have a degree in IT, maybe you could figure it out. If you do, please let me know!

I would have given this card only 1 star, but since it did indeed fix the video problems and the sound does work sometimes, I wanted to give it at least 2 stars, but I really used my microphone a lot so the fact that I can no longer use it really annoys me."

The integrated graphics weren't cutting it. This card dropped right into the PCI Express x16 (1.1) slot and worked perfectly. There's no fan to make noise and it doesn't draw much power. Windows 10 downloaded and installed drivers and we updated those with the latest nVidia drivers. I connected this to a new LG 4K monitor and it works beautifully. I expect that we will be able to view some 4K HDR streaming content soon. I will update this review once we've checked out the performance of this card with some 4K HDR streaming content.

This video card with 1GB memory allowed me to raise the resolution from 1080P (1920 x 1080) to nearly 4K (3840 x 2160). I had problems raising it to full 4K (4096 x 2160) with some of the spreadsheet cells intermittently turning black and then returning to normal with pgup/pgdn. I do not know if the problem is insufficient memory or the change in aspect ratio (3840 is exactly double 1920 as 2160 is 1080). In any event, the loss of 256 pixels (6%) at the lower resolution is not enough to worry about. I am very pleased with this video card installation."

Your ram, hard drive, etc will all take into effect with how it synergies with a graphics card. If you put this card in an old computer dont expect it to be 5x faster. With that said, I have a dell xps 8500 purchased in 2012. All this time I have had to play games on lowest of settings, turning pretty much everything off in my display settings ( vertical sync, shadowing etc. etc. etc.) which played smoothly but with LOW LOW settings on my old graphics card. My computer has 24 gig ram so more than enough memory. I've had an AMD radeon 7500 64mb ( it says that but when I look it up its 1gb on computer?) not sure but regardless I thought to myself I needed an upgrade in graphics card (obviously) and because it has been so long and I didn't want to spend too much money. So I bought this card. After popping it in my computer, my computer restarted a couple times after I started it up, went onto nvidia.com and installed the graphics driver without issues. Fan ran well on the graphics card. I tested it on call of duty which i played, left 4 dead 2 on high settings without any issues and other games on high settings. It's pretty incredible how I can actually play on high settings smoothly!!! For the price I think it's great and works well. how long it lasts? don't know about that yet. But so far so good. All in all, if you have a computer with enough ram i think this will be good to buy as it should probably play all games without any issues"

The card fits nicely and the power draw is no problem for the stock Dell power supply. This model is fanless and will emit some heat, so make sure your case fans are adequate. Video quality is more than sufficient for daily work and productivity, streaming videos, and watching movies fullscreen at 1920x1080. I don't do any gaming so I can't rate its utility there.

After installing this card, text was initially being rendered very blurry with visible red artifacts. I had to invest a lot of effort into fixing the Windows ClearType settings to make text readable without getting a headache. This wasn't an issue with the integrated Intel graphics or with a Radeon card I had laying around. It may be something specific to the Nvidia drivers. The time I spent resolving this problem dropped my rating down to a 4; otherwise, this card is a great pairing for the Optiplex 7010 MT."

The design is sleek and if you have an MSI gaming laptop or desktop rig it would seem to make sense to get an MSI controller. However, this controller will let you down. I've used this controller off and on for a few months and noticed the left thumbstick drifts and seems to be off-centered with no way that I can find to recalibrate it. More importantly, however, about 2 weeks ago the controller simply stopped connecting to my MSI laptop and an Android tablet.

I'm not a gamer running heavy graphics so I can't attest to how this card performs in that respect. What I really needed the card for was Windows 10 stopped supporting the card I've been using for the past several years. I was getting funky driver and display problems because Windows was installing their display driver and I had to jump through hoops to get the old one working (ATI stopped making drivers for it after 2012) after every major Windows 10 update. Along with that, there were random BSOD Video TDR Failures (because of the smaller updates).

I don't need a super duper fast graphics rendering or massive memory, so I went with this card. The price was right and most of my electronics are refurbs anyway. As long as it works, I'm happy."

Only supported a square screen on my widescreen monitor until I updated Windows and when I tried too update to the official drivers it would only output a green screen, so I have yet to update them, but it is working fine only occasional stutters when running multiple tasks as it only has 1 gb of RAM! Definitely going to keep this thing around in case I ever build another pc and need a display output!
Pros:
-Cheap
-Works for basic computing/media
-Surprisingly can run LoL at 60+ fps (Medium settings) depending on the rest of your system.
Cons:
-Can't play AAA games at more than ~20 fps on low settings, but it's not meant for that.
-Couldn't update drivers without having to reinstall windows a couple times so I gave up on that. (-star for that headache)"

Inserted the new MSI card in the pci express slot and then it automatically installed video drivers and the new card works perfectly!
Mind you this is a band aid as my system was a custom build by me 7 years ago and looking to build another system. I ran a new Windows experience index and it dropped my score from a 7.3 to an overall 5.1. Gaming graphics dropped from a 7.6 to 6.7. I realize for $45.00 I'm not going run at 60 fps and I play most of games now on my PS4.
I really like MSI and the other card will probably still run if I update the drivers but I needed my desktop for work and the video capabilities are just fine for what I need.

I did find it through another site but to my excitment it is less expensive on amazon. The card only took a couple days to arrive and once I changed out the brackets and got it popped into my CPU, I was off and running. I did have to use a driver booster program to locate my missing divers for the card but once that was all done adobe has been working perfectly.

The low power consumption, low heat (fanless), and low-profile brackets make the GT 710 ideal for small form factor desktop PCs.

I’m actually not sure what is the use case for this kind of a card. Either you have an old machine and you’d be the kind of person that would be able to accept better a used decent GPU, or you have a newer yet lower end machine that nonetheless is likely to have better integrated graphics.

The first bad was that it only supported full 1980 x 1080 on the HDMI port and only supported 1920 x 1050 on the DVI port. I was willing to live with that.
Today, only 18 months after installation, the DVI port refuses to display anything. Having two identical monitors makes it easy to swap the cables back and forth to confirm. I've reseated it, unplugged them both, reboot and cold booted multiple times. I even downloaded the latest drivers from the NVidia site. All for nothing.
I guess you get what you pay for with old tech."

Went to the NVIDIA drivers page, and downloaded and installed the latest driver = video display automatically changed to 1920 x 1080. Rebooted the machine = worked perfectly.

Web pages definitely render faster now, and my 7-year old's Roblox (on-line video game) runs smoothly now (which was the main purpose for the video card upgrade).

The card worked perfectly for me (sped up the video on a old computer in a low-profile, low-power package). The Optiplex still isn't a heavy-duty ""gaming machine"", but perfect for what I needed."

This graphics card allows me to once again use 2 monitors and I could not be happier. I have only had this card for a few months but as far as I'm concerned this thing is tip top and highly recommended. I am not a gamer so I can't speak accurately on that part but if you're a multi-tasker looking to get more done or someone who wants to live stream video in one monitor while reading your script off the other monitor then this graphics card is for you.

You need to spend more money, and you need a card that requires external power.

However, if you've recently had an inexpensive card fail, and you dropped back to onboard graphics to discover that a lot of your video files are green (with no image) in Windows 10 with no recovery, then this is great. It was easy to put in, the drivers installed automatically, and I'm cooking again while I save a few more months for my next desktop."

My PC is a SFF (small form factor) desktop so I needed the low profile card. For moderate to low level gaming (Fortnite, Minecraft), this card is perfectly fine. I did not need to upgrade the power supply for this card to function. The heat sink means it runs silently and with a SSD, the PC hardly makes a sound while it's running.

I had to use the low profile bracket so the VGA port requires a second external slot in the back of the case, but that wasn't a problem since I have no other cards installed. It took a firm and steady press to get the card into the PCI x16 slot. Just make sure you're pressing the card straight down, not at an angle, and it will click into place."

Top notch! I play Sims 2-4 no problems whatsoever on a low profile machine!,"I have a low profile dell that I got off amazon refurbished. I installed this graphics card and oh my goodness it is absolutely amazing. I use this computer for Photoshop, my Etsy store, and my Sims game. I also do a lot of streaming on this computer. I've had zero problems. I absolutely love this graphics card.

My only issue and the reason for 4 stars is that it comes installed with the regular adapter. You better have a good screwdriver or pliers handy because will have to switch it from this to the low profile adapter."

That unit was failing and only displaying bits and pieces of video display on my screen. The new MSI GeForce GT710 installed very easily and the downloaded software was easy to set up to my desired preference. It installed quickly and without a glitch. I am not a heavy gamer so can't comment on the extent of this card's performance, but for general video performance it works perfectly and is well worth the $39 I spent at Amazon.com.

Great for n00bs,"Easy to install, great bargain for intro to gaming PCs. I'm not an actual PC gamer, but I do develop games in Unreal Engine and GameGuru. This made it possible to use both at a low price. It's not perfect, but for the price the graphics are pretty awesome. It came with a low profile bracket. My only problem is that I didn't have a pair of needle nose pliers to unscrew the regular bracket that came on it, but no problem I just borrowed somebody else's pliers."

I am using it with an older 1.8 ghz processor. The setup plays 1080p video flawlessly all day and the card never gets over 40 degrees and makes no noise. If you watch 4k you might want something a little better like a gt 1030 but for 1080p video this card works great. This card saved my old pc and made it useful again.

It will then proceed to tell you that ""this device is not compatible with the latest version"" or something to that effect.

When installed, this card disables the on board graphics controller and no signal sent to monitor. Don't have time now to trouble shoot the problem.

This MSI card is PCIe V2.0. Have to check whether the slot in the Lenovo M91P is V1.0 or 2.0. May have compatibility issue.

Honestly, do not waste your money/time. I bought this thinking an independent graphics card would be an improvement to my daughter’s computer. IT WAS NOT. She has an A10 processor (2013). I maxed the ram, installed SSD and wanted a light duty graphics card to take load off the GPU.
Man was I wrong. Not only did this perform terribly but it dropped graphics frames per second in half. I tried two different drivers, neither made a difference. I used DDU to remove old display drivers first and install new ones to be sure there were no issues"

I suspected that the onboard video was overtaxing the processor. After installing this 1GB video card, the issue is resolved. I don't game, so I can't comment on it's suitability for that but I would think that you need a higher end GPU for that application but for general use, this card is more than sufficient and it doesn't use enough power to cause issues with a low wattage power supply."

They work fine they are quiet and unlike most cards you don't have to replace them in a year or 2 when the fan wears out. Best of all they don't pester you every 3 days with driver updates that want to ad some unwanted junk software to your computer. They do support HDMI audio but enabling it may disable all other audio outputs as it is with most HDMI audio. I am not a gamer but when I built my daughters (who are gamers) machines with these cards they did not care for them.

About six moths later and it's crashing regularly. I'm guessing some MS update didn't care for it."

As a computer hardware novice, this got the job done. The size was too big for the box, which was solved by cutting the metal and tucking the VGA output back. Besides the size thing (my fault) it worked great. Plugged it in, installed the driver off the CD, restarted, and it came right up as desired. Can’t complain for the price. Worth it IMO, as the alternatives ($20 less) were hdmi splitters that promised at best 800x600, and I was not willing to sacrifice the picture quality. Anyway I have no idea about gaming, but for additional video outputs, this worked perfectly."

My major concern was that the power supply of my computer was limited and the computer was designed to resist any possible upgrade other than a ram option, so I needed an independent video option that didn't use much power, this card definitely fits the bill.

However, for those of you guys who are running high graphic intensive on steam I would not reccomend if you are trying to achieve higher than 1080x720P. I know if you get two of two of these cards you could run sli with no bridge gap but it takes a lot of work to get it working. I would reccomend you look for a 4GB to 6GB VRAM GPU rather than buying this card.

If all you need is a simple GPU then the 2gb MSI GPU is probably the best budget GPU and bang for the dollar for games that only require less than 2gb of VRAM at high specs.

2) requires a mini-HDMI cable.

I didn't see any mention of either of those two in the description/specifications.

A poster on the Acer company forums suggested this card for my Acer XC-704g desktop.

While it physically fits, I didn't turn on the computer while it was in there, the power supply is too weak. Increasing the power supply wont work as this computer is really a laptop motherboard in a small factor form case.

edit: I tried it with power on and the case open so I could see if the fan came on. Only the cpu fan started up. No video. There was no flickering on the screen suggesting it might be trying to work. I tried the mini-hdmi on the card's port. Shut down the computer and then tried the hdmi cable on the computer's hdmi port.

Still no video. Only the cpu fan started up. I'll keep the card as I found a newer desktop computer with a 300 watt psu and will try the card in it. But this desktop purchase wont be until later in the year."

My only issue was that the video card fan was dying so it was either build a new pc or replace the video card and squeeze out a bit more from this relic. Of course with the GPU market being overpriced due to data mining it took me a while to figure out how much performance I was willing to pay for at this time, with maybe an eye towards this being used in a new pc build over the next year. Fortunately the extra research this required allowed me to stumble upon an issue I didn’t know I had. That issue is that a few years ago PC BIOS was replaced by UEFI and the latest video cards won’t even boot on what is referred to as ‘legacy’ bios. After some research I found that this 1030 card is one of the most recent cards which will boot with legacy bios and is why I selected it. It was also only around 70 bucks which made this an easy choice. It installed easily, I pulled down drivers from Nvidia, and all is well. This card was theoretically 50% faster than the card it was replacing but when I ran new benchmarks it only reflected a few percentage points in some tests and better in others. There are other bottlenecks on this old system so I’m not surprised but since I can’t install anything newer than this model, and my old card was dying, I’m still happy with this purchase."

(non-gaming)","I received my GT 1030 OC from Amazon Warehouse Deals (AWD) today and promptly installed it in my 11 year old HP Pavilion Elite M9200t [Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q9450 @ 2.66 GHz 2.67 Ghz, 8GB RAM, Win10 64 bit, PCIe 2.0}...piece of cake, and backward compatible with PCIe 2.0.

As other reviewers suggested, I didn't bother with the enclosed CD-I went to the Gigabyte website to install the latest drivers & the Aorus Engine, mainly to monitor the temperature due to past video card overheating experience (no gaming).

I'm replacing a seven year old EVGA GT 520 card that's been recently having a problem with the fan- it stops turning at inappropriate times and overheats (I used canned air & a vacuum a few times in the last two months to get out any dust particles that might be unseen, which helps for awhile ).

Last week, I tried an open-box Gigabyte GT 1030 silent low-profile (from AWD), but within minutes, it seemed to be running quite hot, despite multiple fans in my PC, so much so that it did sudden re-boots of my PC several times. It also had such a tall heatsink that it was smashing the firewire plug on my motherboard. Not sure if that had anything to do with the hot temp & multiple re-boots. I had to send it back. My power supply is a 385W that isn't maxed out so it's not that.

This GT 1030 SC isn't as tall as the fan-less GT 1030, so it's well below the firewire plug and has been running fine without any re-booting issues. The temp has stayed around 37°(C) with standard PC use (no gaming, just watching videos, web surfing, MS Office, etc).

So far, this card seems like the perfect replacement for an old PC like mine or newer machine.

NOT reflected in my review rating is that I went with AWD to save a few dollars over a new item. I'm not opposed to an open-box product if it works as it should. I'll admit, I was initially concerned about the condition of the card when I saw the box's condition, but the card seems to function fine. AWD's description of the item was accurate. Everything is running great! :o)

I had less than $100 to put into a PC that I had invested $127 into in hopes of reaching an FPS average that would allow me to play online racing and flying simulators without the latency that would hinder my ability to be competitive or cause grief to those playing on the same server due to my inconsistency in the game's sync. I bought an older Dell Optiplex 790 retired workstation PC from the FB marketplace for $100 that came with an Intel I7 CPU, 8GB RAM, DVD-RW, front multi card reader, 1GB GPU, and 300w PwrSply, but no wi-fi card, input devices, display or cords. I had a small junk pile of old keyboards, mice, cables, etc due to being very low income because of decisions made 25yrs earlier. Anyways, I get a lot of use from repairing broken things as well as giving new life to older items in which people have lost interest or have upgraded from. I found this and pulled the trigger with the order. While waiting on its arrival I installed 4GB of RAM for $23 to give me 12GB RAM. I also downloaded iRacing, War Thunder, Project Cars 2, and a lower level MS store flight sim in anticipation. With the original 1GB GPU, iRacing would run at 70FPS at the lowest settings which isn't suitable for dirt racing as dynamic HDR graphics are required to compete at any level. War Thunder wouldn't run at all on minimum settings without consistent tearing and lockups. Project Cars 2 would run barely on min while the low min req need flight sim would run but was full of lag with settings higher than midrange. After I installed and properly set up the drivers and config of the GeForce GT 1030 2GB I decided I had no idea what I was doing when reading stats. This GPU runs all the above games on at least medium settings without any lag or graphic degradation during play. I can run iRacing on their recommended cap of 84FPS with most graphical ""extras"" and aids on high while running car and track textures on ultra-high. I also use med resolution shadows, reflections, dynamic tire and track, and pit crews. I am amazed that I have a PC that I have less than $250USD invested yet it performs as well, if not better than most $500-$1100 ""gaming PCs"" sold in department stores. I have used this PC with GeForce 1030 2GB GPU for a while now without unwanted issues. I am so pleased I have built a custom sim racing cockpit, FFB competition-level racing wheel and pedals, flight stick(HOTAS), soundbar w subwoofer, BlueTooth and WiFi dongles, and a wireless mouse. I now have a decent gaming setup that I use for sim car, truck, FPV drone racing/flying as well as shooter games, streaming, mild video editing, web surfing, watching movies and bragging to those that spent 5X more for the same level of usefulness. my recommendations? Buy the damn card if you have a decent CPU, power supply, and amount of RAM if you want a mid-level gaming machine that doesn't cost more than it realistically should.

I recently got a refurbished PC for cheap and the onboard graphics card was so bad that it couldn't run games that the five-year-old budget computer it was replacing COULD run. Forced to upgrade it, I decided on this card, as at the time it appeared to be the best ratio of price to quality. The ultra-powerful cards were out of my budget, and the ones cheaper than this seemed like they wouldn't be enough of an upgrade to bother.

Getting the thing installed took a while, but I did eventually manage it on my own, and it was my first time ever installing a graphics card. I also got myself an upgraded power supply while I was at it and installed that, too, just to be sure my PC could handle the new card.

Windows 10 runs nice on this machine. I upgraded from the integrated video so I could enjoy videos primarily. On a lark I installed Wolfenstein The New Order, it runs great!

Recently upgraded (or so I thought) from an msi GeForce gt 710 2gb to a view max geforce gt 740 4gb... Which was nice for some games but killed others (dx wasn't supported).. I wanted to build a low budget gaming PC which is finally what this card has done for me, haven't really tried to push it at all but right off the bat.
Fallout 4 runs on med settings - 45-55 fps no stutter.
Bl2 on high settings - 55 fps smooth
Wreckfest on med-high usually locks in around 45 fps
And Friday the 13th on medium settings runs 45-50 fps which wouldn't even run on the viewmax and neither would fallout 4..

I play all my games in windowed mode just personal preference usually around 1600x900-1028.

But let me tell you, I was IMPRESSED. I tested this GPU to its limits from GPU accelerated video edit rendering to playing high maintenance games like COD. I even downloaded Fortnite again just to see the difference. On COD I get a pretty stable 60 fps on normal settings, while Fortnite gives me that and more at high settings. Video rendering went from 10 minutes on a 5 minute video, to 6-7 minutes on a nearly 20 minute video. I know these don't seem great especially if you're looking for the best of the best, but now I don't have to worry about my computer lagging or shutting off.
Bad: If you're looking for a GPU that can handle COD on high settings, then this isn't for you. This GPU can handle modern games, but they make the GPU work for the performance. It is noticeably louder than other GPU's but it isn't too bad. Also, if you're wanting to hook up two monitors, you'll have to get an adapter or use one HDMI and one DVI."

It is pretty much garunteed to fit and it doesn't require any large power supply. Anything above 250w honestly could run this thing. I used this card until i was able to get my gtx 1070. It doesn't really compete, but for the price this gt 1030 can run a lot of games at decent settings. I recommend this card for light gaming/4k video streaming. I was able to play fortnite at 1080p at medium-low settings at 60fps. As long as you have 6gb of ram and a processor that has 2+ cores and clocked at 3.2ghz you should be good on the bottlenecking. (I used an i7-7700k and 16gb ram with a 750w power supply lol). However if you have a few dollars more try to get a gtx 1050 or 1050ti, because you will get a much better value per dollar there."

A couple notable things, though, I did run into some issues installing the driver, but a fresh install fixed the issue.
You will most likely need to search online on how to get it to get the card to access the full color range, for some reason by default it's not already set up, but it's just a matter of enabling a setting.

Also, it does only have 1 hdmi port, and 1 dvi-d port. Which was a little frustrating for multiple monitors, as I have trouble finding dvi monitors, so I recommend possibly getting a DVI to HDMI cord if you plan on using 2 monitors with HDMI ports."

It was almost like somebody spilled pop on it, and it resulted in some corrosion of the copper parts. It does still work, like I said, but a GPU should not be sold, even a lower-end one like this, in this condition.

Edit: Also, for anyone wondering, I simply used 91% isopropyl alcohol and q-tips, making sure to leave no fibers behind, to clean the card, and it worked just fine. If you also want to try this method, just make sure you let the alcohol evaporate completely before you plug the card back in.

The photo I've included was before I cleaned it. Sorry for the flash."

with a lot of the video cards out there today many are fakes, so when I saw this are only $89 I really did my research to make sure it was the real thing. This was purchased two weeks ago and I was surprised the prices gone up $20 to 109 now. The I arrived sealed and is authentically identified. Installers straightforward to not require very much room. Why this is not a low profile, it does sit semi-low and is very quiet.no power cord is required and if you've installed anything it's a pretty simple process to snap the video card in place includes you case back up.
The install of the included software failed. Time and time again I tried to run the setup program and it would not install. It would get to a certain point and not open up. I therefore went to the Nvidia website and downloaded the proper drivers and there was no problem at all it may have just been a bad CD, but I think there were some compatibility issues.

it seems to operate very well with call of duty, Saints Row, grand theft auto, and most others even at high resolution it worked well.. I notice in some reviews with the amount of frames that are being used. However this is going to vary quite a bit on your cash set up in the amount of RAM you have on board as well as how your monitor is configured. But it didn't do what it should do for this model the claims that are made on the statistics are accurate and really work well.

Pros:
sleek design
very quiet
easy install
works as it should
Windows 7 64, found the video card prior to installing any drivers, which I did eventually update.

Cons:
included CD did not work
instructions included are pretty useless to hopefully know how to install one

Overview,definitely a great buy for $89 pushing the limits up to $109 I am not sure it's worth spending too much money for this card. Why Amazon and raise the price 20 bucks in two weeks I am not sure however it is a solid card quiet and uses a very small amount of power which would be very good for small computers with little power supplies. As noted it easy to install, and the drivers are actively found online fairly easily. Make sure you use only the official drivers from the Nvidia website. I have been a big fan of Nvidia since the beginning, and have use these cards extensively, the gigabyte version works perfectly fine. I was concerned going in that the GT 1030 was simply a middle ground graphics card heading to the 1050 area. However this little card does hold its own while a full-fledged gaming machine I would not purchase it for. But for a home gaming system looking for average play it will work fine and did for me. Hope you enjoy the review the card is really solid. Only gave it four stars because eventually there is the likelihood and video will not carry these drivers online in the future and if you still need this card for a reinstall somewhere the CD won't work or did not in my case and I see that as a negative that and anyone knew installing a card like this and using the instructions may have difficulty"

300,3.0,PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,NVIDIA,1 GB,1 GHz,$84.49,4.6 out of 5 stars,tremendous speed improvement in video encoding,"Purchased this for one reason only: hardware encoding of videos. Pain in the southern most region to work out the ffmpeg commands to accomplish the task but once done there was a tremendous speed improvement. FYI:
=============
# create a 'HWtranscode' function
function HWtranscode () {
for f in *.ts;
# nividia hardware transcoding
do ffmpeg -hwaccel cuvid -i ""$f"" -vcodec h264_nvenc -profile:v 2 -g 30 -qp 26 -c:a ac3 ""${f%.ts}.mp4"";
done

=============

As for its use as display card: Is seems adequate to drive my two dell 24 inch monitors. I can not detect any other particular improvements. The tiny dongles it requires are a also a pain in the most southern region.

Update September 2018:
No problems and I occasionally use it to drive a 42 Inch Visio TV TV as well as the two Dell computer monitor.
I note someone commented about the quality of the video encoding. That is controlled by the encoding parameters. You can anything from low quality and high speed to high quality and low speed. I tried for something in the middle.

These are the cables that I am using. I needed a 10 foot and a six foot cable. These work and are relative thin. I tried some others that did NOT work.

303,3.0,PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,NVIDIA,1 GB,1 GHz,$84.49,4.6 out of 5 stars,Driver install in a Linux environment is unorthodox,"Installed this board for CAD under Ubuntu 18LTS. The UBUNTU drivers for the board don't work properly, so you have to use the Nvidia drivers. Nvidia's install script leaves a lot to be desired. It works, but isn't obvious. It also doesn't update the /etc/default/grub file so if you happen to change it, the driver disappears and you're left at 640x480. Reinstalling the driver solves the issue, but Nvidia should update the system files so that changing Grub doesn't clobber their driver."
304,3.0,PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,NVIDIA,1 GB,1 GHz,$84.49,4.6 out of 5 stars,Works with Ubuntu 20.04 and Nvida Driver 440.64,"I bought this (VCQP400-PB) card to replace an AMD V7900 that died. I'm using it in Dell T5500 workstation with 3 monitors, two in landscape and one in portrait mode. All three monitors are attached using DisplayPort cables. The card is small, so I had to use the included taller bracket to install. The card is short in length and in height.

The card is low power and doesn't require the use of an extra 6/8 pin power cable.

The card does support 3 monitors simultaneously. Also, the card came with three miniDP to DP adapters, even though they're not shown in the V1 pictures. As I write this only the pictures for the V2 version show the adapters. I would preferred not to have to use adapters, but I would have to buy a much more expensive card to get standard DisplayPort connectors. The mini connectors do lock into the back, so except for reliability problems associated with more connections, I expect these will work OK.

The only problem I had with installation was getting the portrait monitor to work. The Ubuntu display settings tool just wouldn't work with the portrait monitor. It either turned the monitor off or left it in landscape mode. I solved the problem by using the Nvidia X Server Settings tool.

I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak to performance there, but playback in Kdenlive (a non-linear video editor) was smoother than with the AMD card. HTML5 rendering in browsers also seems a bit faster.

Amazon was the vendor. No problems with the shipping or packaging."

I would get a different card, but I don't need a $800 liquid cooled gaming card. I might try the P620. Or maybe replace the cables again. Who knows. every manufacturer blames the other.

Wow. So, first I’m going to fill you in on what I’m using so you can make the call yourself.

Dell Optiplex 990
I5-2500 3.3Ghz
Windows 7 Professional 64 bit
16GB memory ( 4x4gb 10600 1333mhz sticks- all same brand/model)
250gb HD
Lenovo 24” monitor 1080p

Upgraded from a 2gig ddr3 card and wow what a difference. I have yet to play a game that I couldn’t max out the graphics settings! This GPU isn’t all that loud, I only hear it becaus I have my case open. The OC option is great, it gives it a nice bump, but haven’t really had to use it unless I wanted to feel spoiled. I’m new to gaming and people say this is a mid range card, but to be honest it pushes out WAY more crisp graphics than my x box one S. The responsiveness is also great. I have yet to see the GPU clock higher than 60C even when the OC option is on. I don’t see a reason for the $1k graphics cards too be honest. This has shown all the power I need! Not to mention it is running on the motherboard and stock power supply of 250 something!

Game played with ultra/max settings.

The Witcher 3
FIFA 18
Endless Space 2
Metal Gear Solid 5 phantom pain
Arkham Knight GOTY edition
Far cry primal

GTA 5 on mix of medium/high
GR Wildlands on high/ultra (using OC with some tweaks in bios) even though some features load slow ie. terrain

Edited to add some games I’ve played on this card since I bought it.

-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE:

So when I first got this card I was a bit of a newbie when it came to gaming. This card is still a very good card! If your worried about FPS, I'm sorry, unless you have a beefy system with matching ddr5 memory to add as vram to the card, you won;t get it. The above games I was playing at lower resolutions, with higher settings. I was originally playing with the stock PSU on my pc, but have upgraded recently to 550W PSU. It has made this decent card into a better performing card! With the new PSU I was able to push the card a lot harder when I overclock and it did make a huge difference in how fast the images were rendered in game. The current games I play are below:

These unlike the last review are all on full screen 1080p.

Ghost Recon: Wildands --- Mostly medium settings with ultra texture levels. Average:35-42 FPS
FrostPunk: ALL Ultra settings ---- 40 FPS almost constantly
FIFA 18: Ultra/Max settings ---- 50 FPS plus
Sims 4---Ultra/Max everything-- does it really matter? lol its Sims. Walk in the park even without overclocking.
Fallout 4 GOTY-----High/Ultra mix -- without MODS in game it did well 45-55 FPS, with mods about 35
Batman: Arkham Origins- Max settings 50-55fps
Witcher 3---Mostly Ultra but with a few off or on low---45-50 fps
Splinter Cell:Blacklist-------Ultra preset in game ----50 FPS
This War of Mine-----Ultra Settings----40-45fps
MGS V----Ultra Settings 50 fps SOLID\

The card I think with a strong PSU can take on MUCH more than it can with a stock PSU. I thought about upgrading to the 1060 for future proofing, but I just can't seem to justify it yet :)

Even with only 2 GB VRAM on the card, this this is handling what I throw at it well."

I bought a small form factor HP 570-p064 (for $400) to be used for general, non-gaming use, but soon after I decided to upgrade the power supply and get the best graphics card that could fit in its cramped case. After hours of research, I found that the only card that would reasonably fit would be the Gigabyte GT 1030 -- a very flat, 2 GB GDDR5 card -- and I ordered it from Amazon for about $95.

So, I installed an EVGA uATX power supply and the card...But after less than a week of playing some old Steam games and demos, I was disappointed by how much it did not improve upon the integrated Intel HD 630 graphics. I believe I needed a 4 GB video card, although they were twice the size; it would be a miracle to find something that would work in a HP 570.

I just couldn't believe the GT 1030 could be the only option, but the PCI-E port is flanked by a power supply and a slimline DVD player. In addition, the motherboard's two yellow audio inputs are partially blocking the top graphics card slot -- a weird design choice. So, the prospect of installing any dual-slot, 4GB card would be limited by card length, height, and ""shape"": Basically, any ""blocky"" cards (like some of the EVGA models) longer than 6.8 inches would not work.

I thought that maybe this Gigabyte model would work, trying to measure and imagine it in my case. Well, I was lucky enough to find an obscure review from another HP 570 series purchaser (on another seller's website) who wrote that the Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti Low Profile graphics card ""barley fit."" It seemed that the length and height would be OK, and the sides might just perfectly angle near the front of the card to allow just enough space to clear the motherboard's audio inputs.

Well, I chatted with Amazon about the situation and they took care of anything -- FIVE STARS for customer service! They sent me a new 1050 Ti graphics card via free one-day shipping, and they said there would be no penalty if the card didn't fit. And they helped me return the GT 1030. Thank you Amazon once again!

I was very happy when my new GPU installed perfectly, and I got started sampling some games.

My HP 570-p064 only has an Intel i3 dual-core 7100 3.9GHZ processor with 8 GB DDR4 RAM. Windows 10 64-bit is on an SSD, and my games are installed on a 1 TB hard drive. I am limited to a 23"" 1080p 60 Hz monitor. Here are some of my in-game FPS results with the Gigabyte 1050 Ti OC -- with some slight overclocking -- using 1080p resolution:

- Grand Theft Auto V with high settings and some effects: 50-60 FPS average
- Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition with high settings: 60 FPS
- Final Fantasy: A Realm Reborn with high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Max Payne 3 with very high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Doom (2016) with max resolution and medium effects: 60 FPS
- Spec Ops: The Line (demo) with the highest settings: a solid 60 FPS
- Skyrim with ultra settings running high definition textures: 60 FPS

I hope this review helps anyone with an HP 570 series computer make a sizable graphics card upgrade. Although it's more of a casual gaming card, I believe it can play games on par -- or better in many cases -- than a regular PS4. Your success will largely depend on your processor, too, and I have an average Intel unit.

Please note you'll need a new power supply as this card draws 70 watts, and the stock 180-watt power supply will not work safely, if at all. I recommend the EVGA 500 watt White model. And if someone finds an even better GPU that fits an HP 570, please let the world know."

RGB works fine as long as you're not plugging it into a $20 motherboard. Anyway, this card gives me my frames and resolution, I'm happy. But remember, CPU has a big impact on your FPS performance, as well. So don't judge my frames just based off of the fact that I have this card (the 1050 G1 Gaming 2GB). I have an i5-7600k paired with this 1050.

1920x1080 jenky 60hz monitor;
CS: GO - Average 300 frames on tweaked medium/high graphic settings
PUBG - 60-100 FPS tweaked graphics settings
H1Z1 - A very stable 90 fps (just got it, may have capped fps setting somewhere i don't know about)
Rust - 90 - 110 FPS
League of Legends - 150 to 300 FPS, although I hate this game so don't ask me anything more about it
Fornite - 130-180 FPS ( hate this game too)

Anyway, you get the jist. I got it for ~$40 less than it's listed at right now; so I'm definitely satisfied. Cheap and great for casual performance. 4 stars simply because of the inherent product quality, (it's just a 1050), and the fact that it's gone up ~$40. Would have given it 5 stars because of the great value to performance if it was still sitting at the cheaper price!"

The first card I purchased was a GeForce GT1030 2G, but only because the size of the computer didn't allow for a larger card. Then, I purchased the GT1050 Ti to test for upcoming builds and I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's get one big thing out of the way. This card is not top of the line and is not intended for serious gamers. Having said that, for beginners or someone that needs a decent upgrade from an integrated graphics card then this card is what I recommend.

I play a decent amount of Civilization V and City Skylines. On medium settings I'm averaging roughly 50 fps. Granted, I have a 500gb SSD, 1TB HDD and 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAM with an i5 processor. So, if you have less memory or a slower processor you may not get the same results. I'm betting if I doubled my RAM I could probably squeak out a bit more fps.

Seriously, if you're a newbie to gaming or just want an affordable upgrade to your current graphics, I recommend you take a look at this card. It does NOT require additional power and I run my card through a Dell desktop. Anyone that knows Dell computers knows that their PSUs don't have that much juice. However, after upgrading to a EVGA 600w PSU today, my fps went up slightly to around 55fps."

My gaming consists of Blizzard games (WoW, OW, HotS, and Diablo) which aren't too demanding for decent settings. Since installing the card, I have been able to crank up the settings (9 in WoW, Ultra in OW) while maintaining decent FPS (60). Great introdution to Nvidea and it was a breeze to install. I installed it on my lunch break from work and still had plenty of time to eat and get a QP game in. I did take a star away due to the fan being pretty loud but it's not a dealbreaker for me since I use my headset most of the time."

It works at 1870 MHz (Core) and 3504 MHz (memory) from the box. Was able to overclock it to 1930 MHz (core) and 4504 MHz(memory). It is enough to play almost all games on ultra settings. Though, on 1080p monitors, in some games, you will have to reduce some options as filtering/shadows in order to get 60 fps (e.g. in the Witcher 3). Use it w/ i5-7500, 8GB Crucial 2400 MHz and 120GB Transcend SSD.
In conclusion: good enough for 1080p monitors. If you cannot afford going for higher GPUs like RX 470 or GTX 1060, but this GPU. In my case, I use this GPU with 900p monitor and it provides a comfortable gaming at 60-90 fps w/ ultra setting in heavy games like GTA V, Battlefield 1, Witcher 3, Assasins Creed and others."

I thought I might have a tough time finding something to upgrade it with because the power supply is only 240W and it's a very ""special"" one that has a special shape and can't be upgraded... unless I were to move everything into a new case and I'm not that confident in my abilities. Anyway, installing this wasn't that hard to do because it fits very well and the AORUS software used to control it is nice and easy to use. Everything I've thrown at it so far has worked wonderfully. Of course not all of the most recent games will work of course.

The only thing that I didn't like was that I was sent an email after purchase for the ""Fortnite Bundle"" and while I don't play it, I thought I'd give it a try after redeeming the code they sent me....Well...the code had already been redeemed and Nvidia told me the email that redeemed it and it looked to be a Russian email that had redeemed it weeks before I even purchased this. They told me to contact Amazon for a new code. I did just that and the support was awful. They kept transferring me back and forth over 10 times and basically told me to contact ""the developer"" which I asked them to clarify and they said to contact Gigabyte. I did THAT and was told to contact Amazon or Nvidia. So that was all pointless. If you're buying this for an upgrade, go for it. If you're buying this and you want the Fortnite promotion, you won't get it which is pretty scummy if you ask me."

The plan was to code on one and review documents, specs on the other. Plugged into the system and powered up. Fan on Graphics card was operational, but the screens remained black for several minutes. Eventually the screens turned off due to 'No Signal'. Tried 3 different HDMI cables and the DVI cable, with no luck.

Then I got the idea to plug one of the monitors into the onboard VGA cable and verified the OS was booted. Opened the device manager and saw the card was not compatible with the Microsoft Basic Video Driver. Loaded the drivers from the CD that came with the product and all seemed good. The driver CD required a reboot to complete installation and here is where the problem began.

Upon reboot, Windows 10 crashed due to corrupted files. Rebooted twice with the same problem. Finally Windows executed the automatic recovery which removed the Video card drivers. Once I booted into Windows, I tried again, but this time I downloaded the driver straight from the Website. Upon reboot, Windows reported corrupted files and crashed. This time, the automatic recovery program could not recovery and my whole OS was corrupted. I spent a day and a half reinstalling the OS, the drivers, the updates, and all the programs I had lost on my system.

Tech support was no help. Even asked if I had the outlet plugged into the desktop and the system was powered up. I decided to just return the item to Kohl's for a refund."

I did the same, and i shouldn’t have waited as long as i did to buy this. 1) My Pc was terrible. it still is terrible. it’s a prebuilt from like 8 years ago and if you know anything about pc gaming you know how slow old gaming builds are. 2) i don’t have a monitor. i play on an old flatscreen Tv from, again, like 8 years ago. 3) cards are expensive as all hell. i don’t make steamer casse i’m a casual player, but i still want a mediocre setup.
This card is amazing, if you’re looking to upgrade old parts and don’t have $500 laying around like a lot of people, but this one. If you’re not good with computers and are afraid of having to put one in yourself, it’s simple plug and play. there are thousands of youtube videos that show you how. i don’t know computers. i’m a grease monkey i work on cars. it took me 5 minutes and one screw driver.

obviously if you’re looking for some massive quality upgrade and 144 hz monitor, 3000$ Pc , then no this isn’t for you. but if you’re like me, and want some decent quality of life upgrades, buy this."

While the card itself is good, I've wasted an hour trying to get the bonus. I received an email from Amazon with a code and web link. I followed the link, had to give lots of personal information to create an account at GeForce, to finally get to the proper page. After entering the very long code and the ""I'm not a robot"" validation, it gave a cryptic message ""Please use GeForce Experience 3.17 to redeem this promo code. You can download it at <redacted link at NVIDIA>. I have no idea what that is, why I need it, or why I wasn't sent there to begin with. So, I went to *that* link, downloaded it, went through a time-consuming install, which *seemed* to complete. Then I started it (but it seems to report it as an older version 3.10.x, although Add/Remove programs only shows 3.6.0.74) and (after quite a wait) it reported another useless message of ""NVIDIA Installer failed"" and a link for ""Need help troubleshooting?""

When I go to *that* link, I get an Amazon page displaying 129 items that reference ""Fortnite bundle"" ... no help at all for anything related to my issue.

So, if you want a video card, consider this only as if you won't get any bonus with it. I've lost way too much time trying to get the ""bonus"". It's not worth it."

Now that the mining craze has settled down, these cards are an excellent price for what they offer.

NOTE: The ""Windforce OC Edition"" requires a 6-pin power cable that is not included. I got mine to work just fine with a cheap 4-pin Molex to 6-pin adapter. If your PSU has no unused connectors, either buy the smaller version of the card that doesn't require the additional 6-pin connection or upgrade your PSU.

It seems when the cards work, they work great being an Nvidia GeForce 1050 GPU. However lately they have been crashing while performing 3D gaming duties. The monitor loses signal and cannot recover. The sound proves that the game is still going; the game did not crash.

I monitored heat, ran GPU burner programs, tried different drivers to no avail. The heat plateaus off at safe levels; the GPU programs cannot replicate the issues; the behavior doesn't change with different driver versions or different games. Currently, I am trying to work with Gigabyte for warranty replacement on both cards. Yes, both cards.

Update 1/25/2019:
I received both cards back from Gigabyte --untouched-- with a packing list (yes, packing list; nothing else) that hinted both cards were out of region. When I submitted the cards for RMA, they stated only one was out of region. Now they say BOTH are out of region. Their 3-year warranty is absolute crap when they won't stand by their product. I will throw these in the trash and go a different brand. You have been warned."

Its a simple upgade!","First off lets look what I'm using this in: A old Walmart ""box"" Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer. With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.

Playing what would be considered ""simple single and multi-player games"" with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.

Well this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking ""CPU"" power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now ""booking"" on all my games and simulators!

The GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.

I currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.

So far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.

All in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer.

Installed in about 5 minutes,"Got the card today and working great. Installed in about 5 minutes. Probably would of installed quicker but I spent about 2 minutes looking for the pin jacks for the power supply. (someone in the Q&A said that this card (with 2 fans has to be plugged into the power supply). It doesn't. No connections anywhere on card for separate power supply connection on the card , the whole thing is powered just by sliding it into the PCI e slot. When I first installed the card and turned on PC it used a generic windows driver for about 5 minutes until windows update immediately downloaded and installed the driver from Nvida. One thing, the driver that Windows 10 pulled was pretty old and out of date so you will most certainly want to download the software and run it. I just googled the card name, took me right to their website where you can download a program from Nvida called (GeForce Experience) that will auto detect your card, and download the very latest driver, you can also select in the settings to auto update the driver as new versions come out.

Ran some stress tests on it (not very long about 10 minutes or maybe less, but temp of the card never went over 64 degrees C which is very good. Stress test is designed to push the card to the limits and if the card doesn't run super hot your in good shape. Runs at a steady 32-33 degrees in my computer when not gaming and just using internet and basic windows programs.

Overall I think this card is great value for mid range gaming on the newest games, and any of the older favorites should run at top settings. Also this card has sound drivers built in. Which kind of shocked me. My old card didn't and I was using headphones for the longest time. I was kind of shocked when all the sudden my monitor started having sound come out of it. I didn't even know my monitor had speakers built in to be honest.lol"

It has taken all of them with no problem. It even plays 4k Netflix, which is the main reason I bought it.

The hardest part of the install was having to re-route some cabling in my HTPC case. Other than that, it's simple. I didn't even have to plug in additional power, it works off the mainboard as long as your power supply has enough juice.

Update 05/25/19: Occasionally, and randomly, the display blinks (goes black for a moment). Some videos it's horrible, others it's a couple times at most. There isn't any specific pattern, and is not easily duplicated. Apparently I'm not the only person with this issue, per other reviews.

Since the beginning, I had continuous issues with the screen flickering black and eventually going completely black while playing certain games. I've tried every troubleshooting option, changed settings, replaced drivers, everything I could think of and everything I could find online. Finally in January of this year I sent the card in, hoping they'd fix or replace it, but it was returned with the note that they couldn't find a problem.

All I wanted was a reliable low-profile graphics card that would fit in my slim PC case. What I got was a lemon that's been nothing but a pain from the beginning. It works, but only just enough to get my hopes up before eventually flickering, going black, and requiring yet another reboot."

It has lasted me since, and now I'm retiring it after I managed to get my hands on a 3070.

It manages acceptable performance and medium or low settings in most games. Definitely not a bad card for gaming, but for the same or lower price, there are other options like the RX 580 that perform much better (used market).

I should note, I'm not an expert when it comes to installing hardware, but this gave me no problems whatsoever in my Dell Inspiron 3847 (no need for a new power supply either). I did get a small bug when installing the NVIDIA software in that my mouse cursor disappeared, but a reboot fixed that.

The signs of it going bad started months ago when the monitor would turn off randomly maybe 2-5 times a day. No big deal... Then it started happening 10-20 times a day. Finally I was able to keep it limping along by opening the side of my case and putting a fan directly on it. No problems if I did that. As soon as I took the fan off the heat would reach 60-80 deg Celsius when gaming. Then wierd images would show on the screen and it would freeze. Happened multiple times until the card finally crapped out. The video card fan would spin at 3k + RPM's but it wasn't enough.

Now I'm limping along with my onboard video card until I can get Gigabyte support to respond. My computer hasn't crashed or had random monitor blinking since I pulled the card out. 99% sure the card is the problem. Oh, and I did install the latest nvidia drivers from their website."

The only sticking point with installation of the card is Windows 10. You must install the latest update which contains an Nvidia driver. Do not waste your time , unless you want to, downloading the drivers from Nvidia if you have not downloaded windows update 1803or whatever it is after you installthe card. Once Windows updates, it will load the drivers for the card. I do not do benchmarks and checks for framerates, so I can't tell you the frame rate for any applications..

I upgraded from an Nvidia GeForce 730 GT (pcie 4x) to this card (which is pcie 16x) and OMG the difference is night and day. Granted, it is not ""top of the line) like the rtx cards that have ray tracing, but still an amazing improvement, and for the money I definitely got a better deal than I bargained for.

The included software allows me to switch between different presets to overclock, or turn the fans either to auto or on. If I'm feeling adventurous (which I haven't yet) I can also manually adjust the clock rate and other settings (ignoring the presets).

When the game are running, they are not really noticeable. My cpu and case fans make more noise than they do.

To anyone looking to upgrade from an older pcie graphics card but not wanting to spend a ton of money, I would definitely recommend looking at this one. Definitely do some research, because this card is definitely NOT a hardcore gaming card, but it has handled every game I've thrown at it with flying pixels :P.

Only downside is that the size of the fan and orientation of the card blocks the pcie 1x slot directly under the 16x slot on my motherboard, but that's a small price to pay compared to the performance gain this card gave me."

I do not game; these were hot game cards 10 years ago, but now they work great for just normal (non-game) usage.

UPDATE: I am having to get rid of several of these cards and changed to a slightly more expensive, Radeon RX570, because I have 4 computers hooked to a KVM using HDMI and even though the KVM supports 60Hz, when I change back and forth, these cards mess up the resolution and I end up having all my windows moved to the upper left (especially on Windows 7).

The only guide that came with the card stated to insert the DVD and follow instructions on the screen. I changed the cover for the computer slot to the shorter one that came with it because my computer has a low profile case. Taking care to discharge any static on me I put the card in, inserted the DVD with drivers, ran the setup.exe file on the disc as it didn't auto-run and let it do its thing.

The screen looked weird after installing the drivers. The task bar wasn't showing up so I restarted by pressing the reset button on the computer. Both displays came up after rebooting. Regardless of this issue I think it was an easy installation and overall went well. There are two setup programs, Nvidia and Aorus Engine, that allow you to do some tweaking but I haven't changed any settings yet.

Running the PassMark performance test showed the 3D graphics rating improved from 1255 to 6421 (48th percentile to 82nd) with the card set to Gaming Mode not OC mode. Watching the test was impressive and considerably faster than with the stock graphics. The overall computer rating changed from 4126 or 80th percentile to 5353 or 94th percentile just by changing to this graphics card.

I just got it so haven't done much with it. Pictures come up instantly as I page from one to the next. I am not a gamer but have a few to try. From what I read the original graphics on my i7-8770K CPU is the integrated Intel UHD 630 which I think for general desktop use and watching videos works very well. But for graphics work or gaming this will be an improvement at a reasonable price."

I play mostly Arma 3, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, Civ VI. I also use my HP PC's to record, mix, master hi-res audio tracks and albums. With the standard setup video was 'passable' but really no fun at all as a gaming experience. Glitchy, slow FR, video drops, uneven play, etc...Things just took much longer to do - even my mouse clicks were affected by the catching up the video system had to do.
I always wanted to upgrade my video but I thought a larger power supply was required (at least 500 watts). I am not good enough around the PC to swap-out power supplies, so I needed to find the best video card which would work on 320 watts - and I think I found it.
The 4 GB GTX 1050 card made all the difference in the world. Immediate improvement to the point of losing sleep for playing all the time. Video is crisp, clear, and smooth. It was like playing those games for the first time - really. Just a wonderful improvement. For my music production, the DAW, instruments, and samples load faster and I can tell the machine struggles less to process 24/48 files. Very smooth and fast.
The important thing is you can probably install this yourself - even if you aren't a whiz at it (I'm not). Obviously make sure the card you choose to buy will function in your specific machine or application. It took me 15 minutes to remove the PC cover, remove old card, install new card, close cover, then download up to date drivers. As I said, this card works with 320 watts, so inspect your power supply and make sure you know what its capacity is.
Gaming is fun again. Check out the GTX 1050."

He also instructed me to buy a power supply 500 at least, I did both, installed and I am very very impressed I must say, even on older games such as Age of Empires 3, Ultima online (Yes I am 3,000 years old), counter strike, half-life, among other ones the graphics, speed and game playing experience significantly increased!

Not to mention, I can now play GTA, Just cause 3, the long dark and many other good graphics zombie games, or survival games of today, again for beginners, you can`t go wrong. Easy to install, physically in mother board and also on the software program, simple. 5 stars."
391,4.0,Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti OC Low Profile 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TOC-4GL),Gigabyte,NVIDIA,4 GB,7008 MHz,$84.49,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic output for gaming, but a little confusing","First off, this graphics card is really good for its price. If you're like me, a layperson to PC tech and jargon, then you are just trying to find a simple explanation and review. Does this graphics card work? Yes. Is it easy to install? Yes. Will it drastically increase your gaming experience if you were using lower quality stuff before? DEFINITELY.

It's worth the investment. Now, here are some of the cons.

If you have no experience with working on the hardware of your PC, you'll definitely need instructional videos and guides. Installation is very simple (either some screws, clamps, and snap racks), but the actual ""how"" to get it to work can be a bit fidgety. You need to make sure you have the latest update for Nvidia drivers, otherwise it won't work- at least, mine didn't. Also, the Graphics Card comes with a CD that will install Aorus, a program that helps monitor the output of the GPU (and some other stuff). I'm not sure if it's an issue with my PC, but Aorus keeps crashing my computer. I uninstalled it, and it hasn't crashed since. Just be weary of it. My only problem with the whole ordeal is that it took me a whole day to figure out how to get this GPU running. I googled a lot, and went on forums until I finally saw someone suggest updating the drivers. The Aorus program is not entirely necessary for running your GPU, but I can see how it would be nice to see how far you're pushing the card.

Speaking of which, let's talk about the graphics performance, the main thing you'll want to know. If this is worth any consideration, with this card I was able to push previous games of mine from the lowest settings to the highest. Even the screen resolution for my PC is better thanks to the card.

Here are the main games I bought this GPU for:
1. Company of Heroes 2
2. War Thunder

In the past, my PC was barely able to run COH2 and War Thunder. It would usually crash frame rates, leaving me to play each on the lowest setting possible. I actually stopped playing PC games for a while because of this issue. I configured the GTX, and BOOM. I was able to play COH2 and War Thunder on Max settings for my screen. I've never seen these graphics outside of someone else playing it!

In sum, this card is worth it. It's not crazy expensive like a lot of higher end cards, but it's just about right if you're someone like me who wants a good looking, casual experience."

I ran test on the card only to discover that not only was it not responding anything I was inputting into aorus settings the fans would not respond i contacted amazon tech support they helped a lot thank you guys you are awesome. I finally found a generic program off the net that worked allowing the fans to spin/operate. It also shows the VGA vram and fans RPM and the temp. In a very accurate way which Aorus does not i was pissed off with nvida cause when i tested the vga card it showed there was power going into the fans but and showed the fans had activity but the RPMs were showing 0 across the board. Which gave me the indication these fans were defective which was odd i never came across this issue and even when i ran the card and it reached temps between 84 - 102* the fans did not spin with aorus cause the temp setting was set at 86 and auto and yeah screw aorus If this is how horrible Aorus is becoming then i will not bother with it.

Not sure if anyone came across this issue if they have then just look for another program online

As long as it works with any brand VGA it will work."

What I am saying is that this card is a great replacement for an older power-hungry video card, especially7 if the older card is causing issues with Windows 10. The older card, using the Nvidia 960 GPU was causing my PC to freeze when the video became complicated. The new card with the 1050 is much smaller and uses a lot less power. In terms of speed, they are pretty much equivalent.

I recommend this card for those who want a decent video card on a budget. The primary use for me is streaming content from the various services (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) It performs flawlessly."

This card is still a good card, but in a couple years it will be irrelevant. I still got 60 fps with this card in most games, but you often have to drop settings. For E Sports titles and light gaming I'd recommend this card, but realistically I'd recommend a 1060 or an RX 580 for future proofing. It's not much more expensive and will last you much longer.

Original Review:

So I picked up this card for my HP 6300 Compaq Pro SFF PC. It's got an i5 3570 and 8gb of DDR3 RAM. It had a terrible integrated GFX Card, so I searched for an upgrade. The PC only has a 240w power supply, and is a small form factor case, so size and power was limited in my selection. I found this thing and it claimed it needed no PCIE connection and only used 75w of power. I was skeptical at first but I ordered it.

Well, I can say it works great. This card does a very nice job. I can play PUBG without dropping below 60fps (except while dropping lol) at 1080p with textures/view distance maxed, and of course some other settings dropped. I can also play BF4 at Ultra Preset and never drop below 50fps in multiplayer, and it usually sits around 70-80fps! I plan on trying many more games with this card, but so far it does pretty darn well.

My temperatures would hit 83C at first and it had me nervous, but adjusting fan curve quickly sorted that out. It would never go above 72C after my adjustments, and now with a 150mhz Core/Memory overclock, it never goes above 74C. Bear in mind, this is also a tiny PC (google my PC, you'll see), with very little cooling. I'm sure the card is capable of running cooler, and I plan on improving the cooling of this system in time. Speaking again on the overclock, it does very well. I actually have just stopped overclocking it because it got so boring running tests over and over and over again, but I am positive there is more room to OC it, and I plan on going to it's limits later down the road, but for now performance is great for my $400 build, thanks to this little card. Highly recommend it."

Well beyond what the 1030 will do in about the same sized card.,"This is a great little card for space issues (i.e. ATX and ITX Mobos) in a tight little case. This has the biggest bang for the buck of anything that might fit, then you jump up to the standard VGA card form factor which is usually a nightmare with smaller boards and cases. While this won't run most games on Ultra settings, High is plenty for most titles. The one thing about Gigabyte is that if they last more than the first few days you're probably set for a good long time. They do tend to run hotter than other brands regularly, but not so much that they can't be controlled, and this card is no exception. Usually you find a higher base clock with Gigabyte for your dollar than other brands as well, and the fan noise is no more than I would expect. I water cool virtually all of my builds for sale and personal use, but I just installed this one as-is and it's running fine in a 12"" by 12"" cube from Thermaltake."

Well, if you want to put on your nostalgia goggles, then just have this card running in your case for a few weeks, and you'll have the blockiest, edgiest, ugliest text and video that we've seen in the entire decade.

The problem I'm having is that I had dual monitors attached to the PC before, and after buying a VGA to DVi-D adapter it still is unable to function as it did before installation. When I plug up both monitors it operates as usual for about 2 minutes before it starts to flash the screens on and off with increasing intervals.

(This review is for the 2 fan version that requires external power),"Very good graphics card they have here. I upgraded from Gigabyte's GTX 750 ti Windforce edition (the 4 GB model) and paired with my Xeon x5670 and 24 GB of RAM I am able to play everything I throw at this with High to Ultra settings. For example, I am able to max out GTA V (no advanced options on), Wolfenstein: The New Order, Warhammer End Times: Vermintide, Doom (the latest one of course) among quite a few other games at 1080p, 60 FPS or higher. If you want to play newer games at high settings without spending at least several hundred dollars on just the GPU alone, then you should definitely get this graphics card. I went with the larger version with 2 fans that requires external power, because, of course, the beefier cooler, and in most cases the cards that use external power can get better overclocks, and in all cases you can overvoltage them far better as an external power connector can always deliver more power than the pci-e slot. I didn't do too well in the silicon lottery with this one, I wasn't able to get huge overclocks like with my old 750 ti, but even with a mild overclock this thing destroys my old GPU, runs quieter and cooler, and uses less power. This card is also sexy, it looks fantastic as well as having a backplate. I am extremely happy with this graphics card, and I swear by Gigabyte products, as always they are fantastic. One thing to note about the FTW edition, it's quite long and takes up a bit more than 2 slots with the cooler, about twice as long as my old 750 ti Windforce so keep that in mind if you are thinking of buying this, it could conflict with things you already have in your mother board such as sound cards or NICs, and if your case is smaller lengthwise it may not fit. If your case is for instance, micro atx and not a mid tower or larger, go with the smaller version that has a single fan."

Debated between this card & the 1060 6GB but after some time bought this card. It runs great on games in 1080p. Plays Farming Sim 19 on Very High settings and still getting around 55+ FPS. Runs very cool and silent when not gaming. Ive reccomended this card to a fellow friend and he bought this exact card and it has performed well for him. In other words if you want a graphics card that performs very well for the price point and wont break the bank this card is for you! Will play most current games very well. Fortnite and other common games play very well. Box arrived in good conditon.

Pros:
Runs silent during gaming
Performs very well
Overclocking is easy
Supports multiple monitors (3 HDMI 1080p)

Cons:
None so far. Will update if anything changes.

NOTE**
DO NOT INSTALL THE DRIVERS FROM THE INCLUDED DISC. MOST MAY KNOW THIS BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DONT, MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE DRIVERS FROM GIGABYTES PAGE FOR THIS EXACT CARD.

The CPU in it wasn't capable of hardware decoding H.265. Video would constantly jerk as the CPU utilization was at 100% the entire time.

After installation of the card, I can stream a full 1080 stream of H.265 video with very little GPU utilization, and my CPU sits at around 10% usage.

The two best things about this card are the fact that it doesn't require an extra power cable, and that the fan almost never turns on during light HTPC work."

When it does open, it is very simple and the lighting styles are pretty cool (Flashing with different speeds, lighting up according to the speakers, and automatic color changing).

Edit: 9-8-17
After using this card for a month I can say that I am very pleased with this purchase. I have a dual-monitor setup, main in landscape and secondary in portrait, and have been watching Netflix while playing games. The card doesn't ever heat up too much and runs quietly even under heavy load.
I highly recommend this card to anyone wanting to build a beginner or intermediary gaming pc. It is the best choice when measuring price over performance, especially with the cryptomining operations snatching up the higher end video cards and driving up prices."

With increase in voltage, it can run stable at 2Ghz, 4500Mhz RAM; however it'll run hot, and the fans will be noisier.

Since my rig is on 24/7 I try not to push it. It gets great results in Folding at home, at only 200-250 Mhz boost on CPU, and 900Mhz (to 4,4Ghz) boost on RAM the fans are only running at 50%.

It looks good and, as a nice touch, doesn't turn on the fans below 60C which should extend the life of the card quite a bit.

Anyways, I built this PC so I can upgrade it down the road one of the first things that will get replaced is the GPU.

Honestly I should have just used the money towards my new build, since there was little improvement from the old card. It did however, allow me to run an Oculus Rift S, at lowest settings while still being enjoyable on a few titles.

Overall it’s doing the job, but for the $100 in today’s gaming world, you’re better off with a cheaper card or doing a whole new build."

After six months of heavy use, I have to say it works very well. I use mine to drive two busy ""productivity"" displays with multiple workspaces on a FreeBSD system. The fans rarely kick in (and are not audible over system fans if they do). In the cool of the mid-Atlantic winter, my card has been running at 32-34C in a well-ventilated Corsair case.

I picked this card for:
* large number of outputs (the most of any card pictured on the Nividia site's 1050 page)
* modestly higher clock speeds than the competition, out of the box
* deep fan design (bigger blades can run slower and quieter)
* lower price and power requirements than beefier models
* plenty powerful compared to previous series entry level Nvidia (some of which were barely adequate)

While my use is ""productivity"", that includes a tremendous number of browser tabs, many of which do leverage hardware acceleration, as well as video playback and light photo editing. This card is beefier than I strictly needed (and would likely be fine for light to medium gaming), but I was also sizing it to handle upgrading from HD to WQHD (which I've done now) and/or driving a third display (which I haven't done yet).

Linux and BSD folks might be interested in the card's dmesg output. This is from FreeBSD 11.1:

Being that I was simply upgrading to a newer model GeForce, the changeover was pretty easy.

Plopped it in, locked it in, plugged it in, powered in on and off we went! For 3 whole glorious weeks, it was amazing. It died on me while I was reading my news feeds. 3 weeks old. So young. So pretty. So much hope.

I went through the proper Amazon channels and was led to contact the manufacturer directly. If you've not ever done a Gigabyte RMA, allow me to highlight some things you may not be aware of:

1. Call them. The website ""works"" but it sucks. I registered on it but never got a confirmation email, so to open my RMA I had to call.
2. Once cleared for an RMA you will be sent a gripe sheet and a shipping label (sans postage, that's up to you). You are required to get the RMA item back to Gigabyte.
3. Don't throw away the old box! I'm old, so I have learned that for computer hardware, in particular, it is best to invest some closet space to newly installed hardware upgrade boxes...just in case you need to send it back.

Right now, my major con is that the thing lasted 3 weeks for me. I didn't tamper with it at all when I installed it. The most in-depth bit of ""tinkering"" I gave it was an update to my video driver. That shouldn't kill a card (and it didn't).

I'm not sure if the video card has a defect or what happened, so I am not inclined to speak poorly of it. Frankly, I'm tempted to offer a 5-star review for how awesome it made playing games (PUGB, Sniper Elite 4 looked sick on here, too). That said, I detracted 1 star because it died on me so quickly.

Provided the RMA goes as I assume it will - smoothly because Gigabyte is a pretty solid company I expect my attitude to stay where it is. Good company, typically rock solid hardware (this is not my first Gigabyte purchase). That said, if this goes sideways, best believe y'all will hear all about it."

Built a ""gaming pc"" (i7-2600, 8gb ram) for a family member and needed something that would hold up well.

It plays PUBG at mixed settings, view distance at ultra. Plays fortnite at high/epic. Siege at high settings. You will need to tinker with most graphically demanding games to hit a consistent 60 fps. I had expected more out of the card honestly. But it's okay. The only real negatives of it is the price, WAY overpriced for the performance you get. Should realistically be a ~135$ card. Then the shipping. That was the single most frustrating part about it all. I had 2 orders placed after this, come from China, arrive first. It should never take 2 weeks to get something you just paid over 200 dollars for, unless it's custom order. But overall, not a bad card, but I'll stick with my 1080 for my personal needs."

For those that don't know, these are ancient and I'm pretty sure my iPhone has better graphics...
Old school AMD quad processor, 4.1ghz
8GB RAM
Win 7

^^ Not high end specs by ANY means. Very ancient in terms of gaming power.
I play everything on low, lower, lowest.

Bought this card, had to tell my BIOS to only talk to one PCI E slot (not sure why since it was the same one from the GTX 650) and install some drivers.

I mainly play WoW these days. Everything literally set to 1 (lowest, with most options disabled)
Rebooted, WoW was immediately on High with some options in particle rendering set to Very High. I fiddled with it and managed to get almost everything to Very High with disabling things I don't care for too much like sunshaft quality, shadow quality, etc., and am still running around idling with a 95-100 FPS. In 25man raids it drops to about 80. Mind you, this is with an ancient cpu and very low ram.

As far as the card itself is concerned, besides being a massive upgrade, it doesn't have any pin connectors or anything, you just slot it home and that's it. Its silent, has a fan/heatsync combo, and stays nice and cool after hours of raiding. It has the option for overclocking, but I just don't need it with WoW. And WoW is also known to be rather demanding when you crank the settings all the way up. I also play Dreadnaught at max settings across the board.

Amazing little card that can breath fresh life into a 6 y.o rig!"

I tend to play fairly easy-to-run games on the PC in question, but even still, the MSI R7 250 2GB DDR3 inside was struggling.

Fable Anniversary could barely pull down 30FPS on medium settings. Wolfenstein The New Order/The Old Blood would be at 25-30FPS on low/medium settings. Even Crusader Kings II, Hearts of Iron III/IV, and Stellaris ran at sub-60FPS on low/medium settings.

I purchased the GT 1030 to remedy these faults, and boy, was I not disappointed. 60+ FPS on Fable Anniversary on max settings. Steady 55-60FPS on Wolfenstein on max (okay, very close to max) settings. Paradox games went from a 20-25FPS to well over 70. I was quite shocked by the latter.

To wrap up my review of its performance- let's talk over clocking. Once (basic) drivers are installed via the included CD, a built in clock control program is also installed. It is easier to use than Afterburner, having safe presets- but does not allow for as much control until specifically placed in ""professional"" mode. Otherwise, the clock speeds are just fine for a 69 dollar card. On top of that, the VRAM is DDR5- a massive upgrade for those still running DDR3 VRAM.

As to the more physical nature of the card- wow, is it tiny. Less than half the size of my replaced R7 250, probably a quarter of the size of the 1070 in my main computer. Far lighter as well.

Installation was simple, as it only draws power directly from the PCI slot/motherboard. Speaking of power- this thing barely draws any. Can't recall exactly, but I know that it's a minuscule amount. As long as you have a 300-350W power supply, you'll be fine.

Be warned- given the size, this card only produces ONE DVI port and ONE HDMI port. That's it. Just something to think about. I was a bit surprised they didn't put a VGA slot on a card NVIDIA is touting as the answer to every budget gamer's needs- but I digress. I suppose even HDMI-sporting monitors/TVs are cheap nowadays.

Card is whisper silent, although the first time I installed it, it spun hard and fast for a few minutes, and made considerable noise- don't freak out if that happens. She has great thermals, but I do have an overkill cooling setup in this PC, so results there are probably skewed for the average person who isn't obsessed with cooling.

Anyways, a $69, low-profile, Pascal-based, NVIDIA GPU? It's not too good to be true. Give it a shot if you're on a budget, have power or size restrictions,or even if you're just an NVIDIA or GPU enthusiast. It won't replace your 1070, but it will definitely surprise you- especially given its small form factor and low power draw.

Just a quick side note before I stop rambling- don't ask me how but- I'm pretty positive NVIDIA will be releasing a GT 1040 soon, perhaps by the end of the year. For those that aren't in a rush- perhaps wait for that?"

This computer is used 99% for basic office tasks, watching YouTube, and minimal gaming. The PC has on-board video which was fine for normal office tasks, but it maxed out at HD resolution (approximately 1920x1080). I eventually upgraded to a 4K monitor, but my computer's built-in video couldn't handle that resolution, so I needed to find a very small video card that was powerful enough to support a 4K monitor.

I tried an older card that I'd used with a 2.7K monitor, but it was terrible -- that card was constantly crashing and causing all sorts of problems....it literally wouldn't allow me to watch full-screen videos.

After looking around on Amazon, I found this Gigabyte card and decided to give it a try. So far, it's been basically perfect. First, it fit into my PC's very small case (the case is very narrow so a ""normal"" height video card won't fit). Second, after a simple install and setup, the card has been running perfectly -- zero crashes or other problems.

Although my PC is not really used for gaming, I've tried running some really old favorites (Counter-Strike, etc.) and everything seems to run great. That isn't surprising given how old the games I'm playing are, but still -- so far this card has been fast and smooth with everything I've thrown at it. Pretty impressive given the low price.

One other comment -- this card does have a fan, but it appears to be completely silent. My PC is very quiet anyway, but I can't hear the video card's fan running at all.

P.S. One additional thing -- getting 4K/60Hz resolution on my monitor did not require any special cables....I just used an old HDMI cable I had sitting around and this worked fine. This is yet another bonus point since some monitors require different/special cables to achieve the highest resolution & refresh rates, but that fortunately wasn't the case here."

I did plenty of research looking for something that would work for my particular rig: I picked up an old(er) HP Elite 8200 SFF with Intel i5-2400 3.1 Ghz processor, and 8 GB RAM for pretty cheap from the IT department at work, and it had a GT 310 installed which was barely able to run SWTOR on low settings (30-40 fps). I was worried about finding something that would fit the SFF tower and would run on the stock ~240W power supply (didn't have the budget to upgrade both). Even though this card recommends min. 300W power supply, I researched the specs and it draws the same amount of power as the GT 310, so I felt safe giving it a shot. Plus, I don't have much else running off the PSU so my total power needs are relatively low. Installation of the hardware was easier than expected (yes, it includes the low-profile bracket which was necessary for the SFF tower), and the software installation was as simple as booting up the computer after installing the graphics card and running the CD. It took about 20 minutes to install all the programs and drivers and was ready to go. I am now playing SWTOR on Ultra settings at 1600x1200 resolution with a framerate of 80-90 fps. I was able to temporarily plug into a different monitor and play on a slightly modified Very High settings (reduced AA, but not off) getting 60-70 fps at 1920x1080. I don't have a need to play the most recent games, just some sorta-oldies-but-definitely-goodies (I will be trying out Skyrim soon, and I have no doubts it will run fine on High settings). I have to say that this card is really great for the price and an outstanding choice for an entry-level graphics card for gamers on a budget."

I have a Dell Inspiron 3656 which is a small form factor case with a proprietary 240 watts power supply. I wanted to upgrade from the on board GPU, but quickly discovered that there were few options. In fact it was either an older card from several years back or this one, the Geforce GT 1030. I went with the Gigabytes card because of the fan which makes it a thinner card more suitable for my small case.

This card has exceeded my expectations. Before installing the new card I ran 'winstat formal', a built in benchmark in Windows 7 thru 10. The on board GPU scored just 5.1 for graphics. After installing the Geforce GT 1030 I ran winstat again. This time the graphics score was 8.1 (on a scale of 1-9.9 in Windows 10). I am now able to play two year old games at 1080 with high graphics settings. This is not a true gaming card and I am sure if I had tried to play something like Witcher 3 I would have had to scale things down a bit. In Kerbal Space Program I am able to play a moderately modded game with thirty part ships at about 30-40 fps. At this point my CPU is the bottle neck.

Another point I want to stress, because I think it is important, is that the fan over my APU no longer kicks in. When I would first start my computer or launch a ship in Kerbal Space Program, the fan would roar up to full speed to keep the APU cool, but after installing the GT 1030, it does not. The APU is running much much cooler, which is a very good thing. I could probably overclock the system now, which Gigabytes makes very easy with its utility.

The fan on the Gigabyte GT 1030 is really very quiet, not much above ambient room noise. This make the card a perfect choice for a small form factor low wattage HTPC. You would never hear it above the sounds in the 4k movie you are watching. I can not hear it above the sound produced by my heater.

If you have a Dell or HP computer with a small form factor case and low wattage power supply, this is the perfect upgrade to eek out a couple more years out of your system. Or, if you want to reuse your older computer as a HTPC capable of watching 4k videos, this card will do it for you."

Greetings everyone,

In Part 1 we will show the result of noise testing, and in Part 2 we will note what this special unique card is best suited for.

PART #1: SUMMARY OF NOISE TESTING:
-----------------------------------------------

GOAL:

We want the fan to keep the Graphics Card GPU at or under 82-87C. This is 10-15C cooler than the max GPU temp (Tmax).

TEST ENVIRONMENT:

- SMALL COMPUTER CASE with lots of air venting (a worst case case for noise)
- NO OTHER FANS in the case other than CPU fan
- GPU at 100% load

RESULTS:

(1)
33%-50% fan speeds all result in 79C, nearly silent 2'+ away
55% fan speed result in 78C, and still quiet enough for under desk
65% fan speed result in 75C, Audible 4'+ away, OKish under desk
75% fan speed result in 70C, Audible 4'+ away, audible under desk
80% fan speed is MUCH noisier than even 75%

(2)
I CHOSE TO MOSTLY RUN AT 33% fan speed (lowest settable) since at 79C we are still well under the 82-87C goal. At that fan speed it is INAUDIBLE UNDER THE DESK.

33% Fan Speed translates to 1,940-2,090 RPM.

Side Note:
I would think in a mostly enclosed case it would be mostly silent on desk at 33% fan speed.

(4)
DON'T use AUTO to set fan speed as it prioritizes temperature over any concern for noise. AUTO can result in extremely high fan speed (ex: 85%) even when entirely unnecessary.

Instead use MANUAL or even better CUSTOMIZED.

CUSTOMIZED is set using the free GIGABYTE AORUS engine application (it's quite simple to use). I set customized as follows:
- 33% fan speed (lowest possible) until 82C
- 55% fan speed 83C-87C
- 95% fan speed 88C-100C

(5)
Remember that a video card pegged at GPU 100% load can generate different heat profiles depending on what it is doing, such as different games and workloads. It's not always the same heat profile even at a fixed GPU 100% load. Thus, 33% fan speed may or may not be adequate for your particular needs.

(6)
Based on all of this, if your new GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 card is quite noisy at low fan speeds like 55% fan speed then you may have a lemon and should exchange it. You will be doing GIGABYTE a favor, they have no desire that lemons make it to the customer.

SPECIAL FAN SPEED NOTES:

In case max fan speed or fan speed % calculations change, here are the RPMs found associated with different % fan speeds on this card.

% _____ RPM
----------------
33% ___ 1,940-2,090
35% ___
40% ___ 2,090
45% ___ 2,250
50% ___ 2,500
55% ___ 2,750
60% ___ 3,000
65% ___ 3,250
70% ___ 3,500
75% ___ 3,750

PART #2: WHAT'S THIS CARD BEST FOR?
-----------------------------------------------

What's special about this card is how remarkably skinny and short it is given its graphics power (SINGLE SLOT, LOW PROFILE). This allows a whole different level of graphics power for many small cases that couldn't otherwise fit anything near its graphics capability.

If you have a bit more space, such as double-slot or standard profile height, you might consider instead using FANLESS GT 1030 options, or for a bit more money up the graphics power a bit and go for at least the GeForce GT 1050 level cards or its AMD equivalents.

Keep in mind this card has 2 GB on it, which is plenty for many uses but can be quite limiting for some more demanding uses like video editing.

Hope that helps!

Best Regards,
Neil"

Hardly any heat, and little no noise compared to the HD 7750!

I didn't really have a use for it, but I thought it would be fun to see what a super-budget-friendly graphics card could do in a free computer. Honestly, I couldn't be more impressed. Since this is a current model, it has up-to-date drivers and supports the latest DirectX. so far, I've tested AC Syndicate, GTA V, Project Cars II, Dirt Rally and Fallout 4. All games perform flawlessly on recommended settings (low to medium). Though it does seem the recommended settings are a bit conservative for this card. I was able to turn them up a bit past the recommended settings with good results.

Besides performance, I was happy with how easy to install it was. The computer came with a 240W power supply, which is actually enough to power this card through the PCIe slot. Being low profile, it also fits perfectly in the small form factor case. I'm amazed at what I'm able to play on this $90 build (the only thing I bought was this graphics card)."

Gave one to my grandson for video games. Bought the GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 which after some research seems to be a low budget good video card. I took some time before testing it. When my son tested it, he informed me that the video will hang randomly and even with the computer (Windows) up and working. The only way to fix it was by rebooting the workstation. After re-installing Windows 10 from scratch I gave it to my grandson. He complained about the same situation. I took it back and spent more than a week researching and testing many suggestions to fix the problem. Installed a new NVME PCIe 240GB SSD which was quite FAST (about 4 times faster than a SATA SSD). In my tests (I'm not a video gamer) seems to be good. But once give it back to my grandson the same behavior began again. After several days of tying and error, I decided to install it in my other workstation which has an Intel i5 PROC, 500GB NVME PCIe Intel SSD and a second SATA 240GB SSD. After a little while, the system started to hang again and as before it will send a message that it has no video. Reboot the workstation and started to work again until it will hang again. Spent several more days and even clean the SSD and reinstall Windows 10 from scratch again, but for no avail. That is when I decided to contact the manufacturer, GIGABYTE. They sent me an RMA confirmation and today I mailed it back (had to pay $12 shipping from my pocket). I will update this review once GIGABYTE answers me for a solution."

Well I can say this...I decided that I would Install games like Need for Speed: The Run, Need for Speed: Rivals, and Sonic Generations. Not exactly super intensive games, but enough to try to test the card. Well, I will tell you that the card handled these games for the most part at the highest settings. NFS The Run ran flawlessly at the highest settings, NFS Rivals ran fine with a few hiccups here and there (when the environment got super detailed and several AI were on screen) and Sonic Generations ran flawlessly on the highest settings. Of course, it is now after Christmas and the kids have been playing fortnite, minecraft, league, and all sorts of other games without any issues. I definitely recommend this card for small builds and for any casual gamer."

Maybe I got a bad card, but while running in Hillsbrad foothills down the road I noticed every so often my toon would slow down like with a tiny hesitation. I lowered my settings to the lowest and it did the same. Tried a lot of different settings and areas...and always random slowing down while moving.

I thought maybe it was my 300 watt power supply so I installed it into my larger desktop with a 400w PS. Same thing...slight hesitation while running every few seconds. Went to Org and same thing...even with nobody around.

Installed a 750ti and had no issues on either PC. I reinstalled my older hd7750 and still no issues at all on either PC.

Like I said, maybe I got a bum card. I stuck it in my HTPC and using it at 720p resolution for popcorn time and seems to be working. 1080p stutters a bit.

Basically disappointed as it is super quiet and I really wanted to upgrade my hd7750 and get rid of its fan noise.

My AMD APU setup worked well for years with H264 based codecs but time has moved on and H265 is coming to the forefront as a newer and more efficient video codec. HEVC or H265 would drive my cpu usage to 99-100% on an AMD A10 as that generation lacked H265 support, after installing this video card, the cpu usage has dropped down dramatically to 7-8% CPU usage when playing H265 files and should extend the life of this build for another few years."

Computer would boot, but nothing on the monitor.

MB: MSI z97 PC MATE
CPU: i7 4795k
RAM: 16GB
GPU: none before (installed this card to see)

I accidentally reconfirgured the windows of a stock chart program.
In order to not have the program save the new configuration, I turned off my computer at the PSU switch while Windows was still running.
After that, for whatever reason, the monitor would not show input when the computer was turned on.

Having troubleshoot some components (RAM, HD, cables, monitor), I searched the internet for similar causes.
Primary cause was not clear cut - some said PSU, some said MB, some said HD, etc.
I figured that since the power was on, HD was spinning, and blue LEDs were on in the case, it had to be the onboard video.

Not wanting to waste $40 on an underpowered older GPU, I opted for this GT 1030.
It's not for major gaming, but for my 4k television monitor and my TOS stock charts with real time data (18 small charts at once), it seemed to be what was needed as those two factors do require some processing power and memory.

I initially installed it on the lower (blue) PCI slot of the motherboard...nothing.
I moved this card to the upper (blue) PCI slot, and VOILA! I get Windows! (albeit initially at 1080p max due to Windows' VGA drivers).

The item came in it's GIGABYTE package undamaged.
New tape was on the tab.
New tape was on the electroprotective package.
It also had plastic covers on the terminals and 2 ports.
It was missing a manual and maybe a driver disc, but all I needed to do was download it off of GIGABYTE's website and install. Upon driver install completion, I was asked to reboot. On reboot, 4k resolution instantly appeared.

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
I'm happy with the ""open box"" price as well.
Delivered in 2 days and I didn't have to spend the gas to drive over to Microcenter or Best Buy, both of whom had similar prices for new. But for this aging machine, a few bucks saved is a few bucks earned."

The packaging from gigabyte isn't anything amazing but with low end cards I wouldn't expect them to be. Used this card for a client, for mainly home theatre use and light gaming. It runs quiet, comes with half height bracket, and to be honest when you are used to using bigger mainstream gaming video cards it's kind of adorable. This video card won't play the newest AAA games but, it will work better than integrated graphics and is really aimed at home theatre use.

Installed in an OptiPlex 5050. Runs e-sports titles like CS:GO and Rocket League at max settings 1080p with 100+ FPS no problem. Does surprisingly well with modern games. Packs a decent punch for an entry level GPU. Will run any older game without breaking a sweat. If you can deal with lower settings or playing at 720p for more demanding titles, this card shouldn't disappoint. As a basic card for an office desktop, this is a great card. Much faster than onboard, frees up system memory normally shared with the onboard graphics.

Card runs quiet and cool. One of the few low profile, single slot cards out there.

I paid $79 for this card from Amazon. I would not spend more money than this. Wait until the GPU market cools down. This card is NOT worth $120.

My computer was a small form factor HP, so I was limited by 2 main constraints. The standard 240 watt power supply was an odd size, preventing me from upgrading it, and the case was small so I need a low profile graphics card. The Geforce GT 1030 proved to be the perfect solution. Its power draw was very low; it drew power only from the motherboard, meaning that no additional plug was needed to power it; and it was small enough to fit inside the case.
I should note that I run an SSD (solid state hard drive) instead of the standard HDD, and this reduces the power use of the computer considerably. This power reduction offset at least some of the extra power drawn by the graphics card. I don't think that I would attempt this upgrade with a 240 Watt power supply and the standard HDD.
Installation was a breeze. Attaching the smaller bracket on the card and physically installing it in my computer took less than 10 minutes. I had difficulty getting the driver to download from the Gigabyte website, but the included CD worked fine. The included instructions are generic and of little help, but fortunately the process is fairly intuitive.
You should be aware that this video card does not have a VGA port. You will need either an HDMI or DVI cable to connect your monitor. This is clearly stated on the Amazon page, but somehow I failed to notice it.
After installation was completed, the performance increase was impressive. To be sure, the graphics aren't perfect. Occasionally there is still the slightest amount of hesitation in some of the graphics. However, the games are now perfectly playable with minimal distractions. The cooling fan is audible but not at all distracting.
With a larger case and power supply, I probably would have paid the extra $80 or so to get a more powerful GTX 1650 with 4 GB instead of 2 GB. However, given the physical limitations of my system, I think that the GT 1030 gave me as much improvement as I can squeeze out of my tiny computer."

The problem isn't with the card though, it was with the power draw. Each time the video card fan started up, my video would go out. My Dell PC only has a 240 watt power supply and the low power capability caused the graphics card to go out each time the fan started.

There is hope however!! Apparently, the same company makes the same card with a larger heat sink and NO fan!! It is called the GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030SL-2GL Silent Low Profile 2G, and it is even a bit cheaper. Just ordered it and am going to try that one instead."

Problem was the Dell sff has limited space (width) for a serious graphics card. This card fit perfectly with room to spare. Took some time to download the included programs (on the cd they provide). Installation of the card takes about five minutes, and I had a picture on my monitor from the first moment I turned it on. Frames per second were dramatically increased from the R5-240 graphics card that was installed by Dell. Huge increase in video quality and power. Fan is whisper quiet on this Geforce card. The exact card I purchased is: GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G. Make sure you get the DDR5!

Additional thoughts - I initially wanted the 1050ti at 75 watts. Contacted Dell and they said a single slot low profile would work and my power supply should handle it as long as I didnt go above 75 watts. I found one card that fit the bill and it was over $200. Issue is the 1050ti requires more cooling and therefore a wider footprint for the fan(s). Also, the low profile means the card needs to come with the low profile adapter. The 1030 adapter on the card I purchased was perfect. After installing the 1030 and seeing the additional space that was left over, im guessing that a low profile 1050ti that takes up a slot and a half or less would work in my Dell 7020 sff. Just guessing but worth a try as Dell rep said the 7020 should handle the power requirements of 75 watts.

Bottom line - I purchased one of the more expensive 1030 cards, and could not be more pleased. First, it fit perfectly and graphics ability amazed me compared to my old card. FPS went thru the roof. Even though is is not a true gaming card. If you are a serious gamer or don't mind spending the extra cash and have limited space you might consider a low profile 1050 ti. Call the manufacturers and get a thin one... slot and a half width should??? work. Worst case is you will have to drop down to the 1030 and save about $80.

Final thoughts - I love this card. It dramatically increased my fps, its quiet, and it FIT!!! And didn't break the bank."

This graphics card (GT 1030) is about as strong as the integrated graphics card on the AMD Ryzen 2400G. At least, this is my personal experience. So this card (GT 1030) is good if you already have the rest of your PC build already, and you only need a low profile and decently strong graphics card that can play most games at 60+ FPS.

However, if you are looking to build low power-consumption PC from scratch, then I highly recommend anyone to buy a APU like the 2400G or 3400G. The graphics card is built into the CPU chip, so it will save you so much space, power consumption, and money!"

The GT 1030 is one of the lower end gaming cards Nvidia makes at the moment but it's a real gaming card. I is perfect for me. I bought it for my daughter, who has an older i5 with a graphics card not intended for gaming. She wasn't able to get high quality textures on even basic games like starcraft 2. I replaced her card with this and now she can max out all the settings and it works great.

One requirement for me: the card I bought needed to be able to use basic PCI power and not require one of those 6 pin plugs from the power supply since her power supply is cheap and doesn't have any. This card does not require a separate power cable.

This card compares with and surpasses high-end cards from a few years ago (I have a Radeon HD4870 for example) but consumes way, way less power, like 20 watts max or something.

I am a middle-aged man that probably spends ten hours a week playing video games. I wanted a card that enabled me to view the graphics in a more pleasing way without sending me to the poor house. The Geforce GT 1030 was a great upgrade for me. It is not the fastest graphics card by a long shot, but it is certainly worth the money! Its performance has been flawless after a month or so of use. The card only uses about 30 watts of power and has a PassMark perfoemance rating of Last 5 Baselines for GeForce GT 1030, most recent listed first

Decent performance for anything you're trying to add a lower end graphics chip to get off the on-board system. Only knock I'd have on this is that it's advertised as a low profile card, it comes with the normal bracket pre-installed in the card. There is a low-profile bracket included with it, however you'll need to remove it and replace it prior to installation. Easy enough to do, and did not remove stars as a result. Just seems it should probably be ready to go for it's advertised purpose and have the large bracket for swap instead. All in all would recommend!"

I uninstalled the previous Nvidia drivers before installing using DDU, and then Windows downloaded a driver for this after installing it. I then went to the Nvidia website to install GeForce Experience, and have updated drivers a couple of times since then. The only issue I faced - and this has nothing to do with this product - was that Windows also ended up installing a driver for my previously removed graphics card, which caused some BSOD issues. After making sure I uninstalled that device from Device Manager, there have been no problems at all."

This card works right out of the box and all I really had to do was install the latest drivers for the 1030 using apt. The one thing I will recommend for anyone wanting to use both the DVI and HDMI outputs is to get a DVI -> HDMI cord if you have a choice between HDMI and a DisplayPort. Unfortunately, the display port option doesn't seem to be recognized properly.

I have one monitor that is 27"" on the HDMI and a 36"" on the DVI output, and it works great. I play games like Portal and CounterStrike using Steam and I can play on the large 36"" at full resolution with all the bells and whistles really well.

It's surprisingly difficult to find a card that meets those requirements, but this one is great. It's small, fast, quiet, supports dual monitors, and fits easily into the machine.

Read this.,"I am not a pro gamer. I’m not going to list all my specs in this review. I’m giving a real life, average joe review. Read this.
I have a small Hp compaq 6300. Its a slim office computer basically. It uses integrated graphics, so games like fortnite don’t play on more than 15 frames per second, which is unplayable. I didn’t have $300 for a fancy graphics card. I needed something small and cheap until i could save. I had lower expectations and I was blown away. I play fortnite consistently on 60fps, and if you’re a casual gamer who just wants to mess around, this is just fine. Now, if you have a computer from 2007 that doesn’t have at least decent other parts, this won’t save your games. games rely on 2 things: the graphics card (gpu) and the CPU (motherboard, basically) if you have a janky CPU this card won’t just magically run games. I have an average joe, $200 office computer, and this does fantastic for what it is. If you need something to get you by for now, this is great. Perfect. If you want seamless high quality gameplay with 240 fps.... this won’t do it. If you know nothing about games and computers, but you want a tiny bit more for gaming, this will probably do what you need. Easy to install, just plug it into the graphics card slot inside the computer and download the software. This is doing great for me. Everyone that’s rating this poorly expects pro level game play, so don’t let their poor review talk you out of it. Do a tad bit of research on your computer, and make your decision, but i recommend this for sure."

He had it up and running very quickly (I'm guessing it was around half an hour, including time looking for another shield.)

He was installing into a computer that did not already have a graphics card, only an integrated chip, on an older computer. He went from not really being able to run Minecraft at all (1 fps) to 60 fps and smooth running. He is very happy with it."

Installation was quick and easy. The screw to remove the plate is easily accessible, and a small pair of pliers made getting the post screws for the DVI port off easy as well. Fit perfectly in the Optiplex 3020's x16 slot and closed back up with no clearance issues.

This card installed very easily and the design is very intelligent. They even offer an alternate plate to utilize for smaller cases.

I utilized this purchase together with a new external SSD, since that is also a new standard to play the new WoW expansion.

The graphics are nice and everything loads very quickly. The drivers automatically installed on my Windows 10 pro while I was executing a search engine task of finding them. That added an extra layer convenience.

Overall I give this card 5 stars. This is due to the price range and ease of being able to install it. Since I only play WoW on my desktop, this is sufficient for me and it runs great.

I would recommend this card for any individual looking for a graphics card upgrade that doesn't require an external plug."

(I should have been able to use the onboard graphics for that, but for some reason wouldn't boot without a video card. No amount of resetting the BIOS and such would convince it otherwise. This was my solution.) I've had much better luck with Nvidia cards under Linux than AMD cards. The drivers are nearly up-to-date with the Windows ones. Works great for a simple Linux server with its standard graphical interface. Very low power (no secondary power from the PSU needed as it's only about 30W).

Someone asked a question about the height of the card if the included low-profile bracket is used. I didn't use it, but I've uploaded a picture of it next to a ruler. I've also taken a picture of the card inserted into my machine.

Not for serious gamers. I bought and installed this for a young kid who occasionally plays computer games. Noticeable improvement from builtin GPU on Mobo.

Fortnite runs just fine With no lagging (depends on your CPU and memory, of course) after installing this video card. Fits perfect to Mobo slot."

Amazon is shipping these in the Gigabyte retail box (as seen in the product picture) with a shipping label slapped on it, or at least that's how I received mine. What's worse is that the box was not even taped shut (and there was no factory sealed on the box either), so it's a miracle that it arrived without the loose card falling out of the box or being stolen -- so beware.

As for the card, it runs cool, and despite the fan is silent. It is being used in a small form factor PC and can run older games like Skyrim on ultra settings at 60 fps (CPU is an i5)"

I asked Amazon for a refund/return, but the 30 day limit was exceeded, so they referred me back to Gigabyte. A call to support there was made. The manufacturer is in China. They declined a refund, said I would need to return to their service center for engineers to assess and refurbish.

However, the card had one major flaw - running games in full screen would crash the system. I have tested this graphics card in multiple systems and have confirmed this crash is caused by this card. Overall, despite this flaw I would reccomend this card to someone on a tight budget.

Update July 1, 2019 - I am now having more major flaws with the card, causing me to have to change settings for five minutes whenever I start my PC. I would reccomend buying a used 1050 or 1050 ti instead of this card, or buying a 1650."

The individuals rating this one star quite possible did not know what in the world they were buying, were being cheap and simply bought the most affordable ""GPU"" or who knows what.. Let me just say that their reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.

The day this was announced I was ecstatic, this was the exact GPU I was in search of for quite a while. 4 HDMI outputs, Zero display ports, Zero Type-C ports, Zero VGA ports. JUST HDMI. Thats what I needed, ASUS delivered.

Let me give you a run down on my set up.. I have an Micro-ATX asrock x570 TB3, Ryzen 9 3950X, 32GB RAM and an RTX 20080. If you're knowledgeable on the Motherboard you'd know it only has one PCIE port. which is utilized by the 2080 GPU. I have this 710 connected via Thunderbolt 3. WHAAAT?! I have four 4K TV's connected to the 710 through TB3, downscaled to 1080P and 30 hertz. It runs like butter. The TV's are used for security camera feeds of 4 different sites running on Blue Iris. I offload all the video conversion/transcoding onto the 2080 as intended and utilize the 710 for its sole purpose, displaying static video. Thats exactly what this GPU is for, not for gaming, not for office work, rather for static imagery such as billboards, a wall of TV's, surveillance, etc. Dont expect this GPU to do any transcoding or high refresh rate situations.

The second unit I have is being used as interim as I await the delivery of another graphics card, GTX 1080. It powers, with no issue, an LG 3440 x 1440 34"" ultra wide monitor with 21:9 ratio. Again, zero issues with the operation. I dont game on the PC yet until I get the true GPU in.

You cant compare apples to apples here, this GPU has 192 CUDA cores, in comparison my 1080 has well over 1900 CUDA cores. Know what you are buying, Know what you will be using this GPU for. For me, this device works as I initially intended and for that, THANK YOU ASUS! you really saved me from using two GPU's for four HDMI connections. The fact that I can use an external Thunder Bolt 3 enclosure to power and send data for the GPU is just amazing.. No regrets, highly recommend this GPU"

There are no buffering pauses, no jerkiness and the action is as smooth as any movie I have ever seen on any single-monitor computer. Folks, this is an amazing video card at a great price. For those who gave it one star, all I can say is they probably didn't realize that they needed to install the 64-bit drivers from the DVD that is included with the card. Without those drivers, Windows will default to a generic VGA driver, resulting in exactly the kind of slow, jerky video that the one-star reviewers complained about. Not only is this card displaying three different full motion, full screen, full HD videos simultaneously, but the GPU isn't even breaking a sweat! The GPU Tweak utility that comes with the card shows that it is loafing along at well under the clock and temperature maximums, with plenty of capacity remaining for a 4th monitor if and when I decide to add one. By the way, I bought this card to use with my multi-monitor trading setup, and it is more than up to the job. Price charts and indicators on all three monitors are crisp and clear, updating instantaneously as new data comes in. If you are a trader looking to create a multi-monitor setup on a budget, look no further.

Well, for work is just ok. For Videos is terrible. Specially if you attempt to watch them at 1080 resolution. Video stops every 5 seconds, and skip parts. Issue is not only with Youtube, but any video streaming via Chrome, Edge, or apps.
Not sure if it's because the PCIe X1 version (the smallest, less fast, slot of the PCIe family), but I didn't have any other option rather than buying a Card for x1, since my PC only has 1 PCIe x16 slot, and that one is being used with the original Video card RX 550, which works great with my other 4k monitors.

This has to be the sleeper video card of the year. A low profile silent card constantly being compared to cards that require a 6 pin line. This card draws it's power from the pci-e slot. No 6 pin requirements. My old card, an hd6750 needed a 6 pin at 85 watts. Most 6 pin cards require between 55 - 90+ watts to operate. This card needs only 35 watts. And it holds it's own very well. Even at 1080 resolution with medium settings, this card can play anything. Smoothly. Low profile, silent, and budget friendly. If you can afford this card, the decision to purchase it is a no brainer. Do your research and you will keep ending up at this card.

It works great and installed smoothly. Normally Nvidia's Linux support is lacking, but it started working perfectly after installing the Nvidia 381 driver and a quick restart on Mint 18.1 (Ubuntu 16.04). It plays all my games fine, though some of them I have to turn the graphics down a bit to keep a solid 60fps, but with how cheap this graphics card is, I was expecting that. It's definitely worth it for anyone trying to keep a low budget on a gaming desktop or HTPC."

I really enjoy how it is dead silent, and the performance to cost ratio is extremely impressive. It can run Skyrim Special Edition at a consistent 60fps on the low graphics preset at 1080p, and can squeeze 120fps out of Synthetik: Legion rising at 1440p. I also tested Borderlands 3 and mostly stayed at 60fps on low at 540p (Better than the Nintendo Switch can do with a lot of games). Outside of gaming (this card isn't really meant for gaming anyway), this card can very comfortably handle your daily computing needs at any reasonable resolution, and for the price they're asking, it's a no-brainer as a backup card or as a pick-me-up for a rig with integrated graphics."
691,7.0,ASUS GeForce GT 710 1GB GDDR5 HDMI VGA DVI Graphics Card (GT710-SL-1GD5-BRK),ASUS Computer International Direct,NVIDIA,1 GB,5012 MHz,$44.00,4.6 out of 5 stars,"this card runs cool, around 110 Fahrenheit under load","I bought this card as a cost effective replacement for an EVGA 2GB GTX 560 Superclocked card that crashed with memory failure. The 560 was always hot, averaging around 140 Fahrenheit under load and the fans were always spun up and noisy. I've never run an ASUS card before the brand is reputable, has been around a long time and the current demand for GPU's for crypto mining has raised prices prett much across the board.

The specs between the 560 and this 1030 card are nearly identical with each a little higher in an area or two. That being said, this card runs cool, around 110 Fahrenheit under load, it uses very little power (powered by the card slot), it is so quiet I cant hear it running over the other fans in the case.

Performance is spot on, equal to the 560 at the very least but I think it's noticeably better performing for the games it's used for (World of Tanks, TF2, etc.). Benchmarking tools (cat zilla, EVGA OC Scanner X) show better performance as well. It's only pushing a pair of 19"" monitors but I expect it could handle decent frame rates on 23"" monitors as well.

I got the card for $129 and for that or less I'd say its a great buy for a budget card."

I love the case, but its ventilation, despite 4 fans, and a vented top, has always been a problem with all but 35W Intel processors with built-in graphics (I was using an i7-4785T). On low graphics settings, there was too much banding, and on higher settings, there was stuttering of the video.

With the GT1030 card, I was able to use the highest video settings and increase debanding in MadVR to ""High."" The picture quality was much better, and the card is of course silent.

Unfortunately, the case could not tolerate the excess heat, and the hard drives went from under 40 degrees C to 50 degrees C. Turning up the case fans to compensate resulted in unacceptable noise.

In a case with better ventilation, this card would make a great replacement for a Haswell iGPU. In the end, I bought a Ryzen 5 3400G and B450 motherboard, and used the built-in graphics of the Ryzen. The results are as good as the GT1030/Intel combination, and power consumption is the same as that combination."

I tried to install the drivers before changing the card, but it could not install because it did not find the hardware.
I installed the card and, at first power up, it loaded the generic MS video driver so I could have the screen working.
After that I installed the Nvidia driver supplied with the DVD, v 24.21.13.9764 dated 5/7/2018 and everything came up fine.
I then checked online for the latest driver and it installed v 24.21.13.9924 dated 9/5/2018.
The only issue I see is that NVIDIA no longer supports Miracast (WiDi), it tries to connect to a WiDi TV and disconnects immediately. I have other machines that work with WiDi but they have Intel Display Adapters.
With the AMD Radeon R9 270 I could connect only using an older driver v 22.19.172.769 dated 6/27/2017.
Any newer driver was failing and disconnecting from WiDi on first attempt.
Anyway, my main issue was the noise of the video card and this ASUS GT 1030 took care of that problem."

Coupled with a core i3-8500k, it's a great system for what I need. People typically want more than they need for gaming - especially old PC games - while I'm from the school of thought 'don't pay for what you don't need'. The latest GPUs are so dang powerful, that even the entry GT1030 here is a better performer than the x50Ti from a couple years ago. I am able to run FSX at max settings, with several scenery add-ons, at a fixed 40fps no problem. Best of all, no dedicated power connector is required; I have plenty of room for spare, even when OC'ing, with a 400W power supply. Another area that a lot of people go overkill on. My only wish is that the 1030s came with a 4GB option. Additional graphics memory comes in handy for all the scenery add-ons in FSX. But for the price, it's hard to complain."

The (Asus) geforce gt 1030 was released in 2017 and that's the same year the integrated graphics on my computer also came out. But comparing the two, the asus geforce gt 1030 is way much better in all department, and that includes doubling the frame rates in games. Of course this GPU may lag behind the latest models and expensive gaming video cards, but having this installed in my computer is a very good improvement over all. Its plug n play, doesn't consume much power and very stable in a 300W stock power supply !! ..so no need to buy a new PSU.

I got the model with the heatsink only(no fan) and it runs cool in basic games like CSGO. Now my pictures looks good, videos and movies are visually striking crisps. The cost for this unit is hard to beat, and I believe I'll still be running this video card for 3-4 yrs in my home PC and will just be updating the driver regularly."

Like any GPU, installation was easy.

The GPU during boot up makes me nervous since it sounds like an airplane taking off. However, running Fortnite and other games has not triggered that noise. I’m guessing you have to really push it to get that.

At first I was worried the GPU wasn’t going to support my monitors. One was not pushing a picture and the other had a really low resolution. Once I used the drivers installation disc, everything has worked perfectly."

This is a good, beginner card. It was very easy to install and set up was easy too. I like the software features that let you customize the performance tailored to your preferences. It performs well enough at lower to mid settings on most games. If you try to max out the game settings, it will suffer from loss of frame rate or display issues.

It's very fast and quiet, but the on-board graphics are just adequate. Web pages and Microsoft Office documents kind of stutter around the screen. It needed an upgrade, and I first bought one of the NVidia cards with two small fans, which is a step above this one. But even at their slowest, the fans still make a small whine I can hear in my home office. It's really annoying to have a computer go from almost silent to constantly whining in the background.

I returned that and got this card. It's totally silent, and screens and documents fly. For gaming, the computer came with Assassin's Creed Origins, and you can play that and have fun, you just have to cut some of the settings back from their maximum. (The on-board graphics can't handle the game at all.)

This card is a great compromise if you want power and silence."

In my opinion, it takes up 2.1 slots. When it was seated, it ended up crooked as it's encroaching on the next slot. The card works fine for a basic card with passive cooling. I'm debating whether to return it or not because I've basically lost a slot and the idea behind this was that I wouldn't be getting a fan that didn't have room to circulate. Instead, its a heatsink that can't benefit from circulation in the case.

I think ASUS needs to make a revision of this card that's just a few mm thinner. There's a few others out there like it by other manufacturers, so if you're wondering about crowding, you might try a different one. If this is just going into a computer where you don't care about the other PCI slots then I'd say it's fine.

Eventually someone will come out with a single slot width 1030 that solves any potential cooling/crowding issues."

As far as I can tell from the Amazon sales page, the product has not changed since then (I have a copy pasted in my log). The HDMI port is 2.0, and it does 4K just fine. I only use that for a large spreadsheet or such, because the letters are too small for general use on my 27"" LG IPS 4K display. So I mostly use 1440p, which is great. Documentation for the DVI port says only 1920x1080 (HD), assumes you know what HDMI 2.0 means.

The main reasons to get this card are because you want silent/fanless operation, and you have a 1440p or 4K monitor. If you don't need hi res, there are cheaper cards. My 1030 replaced an ASUS 710. If you don't mind a fan, there are many steps higher up the performance ladder.

My belief is that all these cards should be fundamentally the same. However, some have fans, which might make them last longer. MSI Graphic Cards GT 1030 2G LP OC has a Displayport instead of the DVI. I don't know if it has full res, or only HD like the DVI.

All these boards seem to go into a PCIe x16 slot. I suspect they all use four lanes (x4), but this board came out before such specs were bandied about generally, so I don't know about this one. Also, somebody commented x8 about some other board.

My 8-year-old i5-2500K system is now intermittently unstable, shutting itself down on two occasions. I have not seen it happen - walked away, came back, it was powered on but dead. The first time, I got boot code B2 and boot failed, which is likely the graphics card. These cards do not last as long as the rest of the system; I'm on my third, after starting out with mobo graphics. So I took a star off, even tho might be unwarranted.

I'm designing a new RYZEN system, which will require a graphics card. Perhaps a newer model from another vendor will be more stable. Perhaps not.

The GT 710 is terrible for modern video games. Otherwise get at least a 1050 or higher. Yes it will be > $100, but your kids will be able to use it for at least a few years.

OK so then why did I buy a GT710 1GB DDR5 GPU?

I just needed a HDMI out for a work machine, that needs to support 1920x1080 via HDMI, and I didn't want a used GPU. This GPU is somewhat modern enough for me to run Windows 10 Pro on it for what I needed it for, plus I suspect that I'll eventually upgrade this machine with a serious GPU for GPU rendering, maybe an RTX 3080+. Until then, this will be a card that I can toss into a machine and work with about any LCD/LED monitor or monitor cable for that matter. It allows me to to test the Hardware and install SW... and that is all I really need it for.

Budget wise, meh, it makes a good basic video card, and is fine for Grandma's older Dell, or Grandpa's slim HP that went out."

Even runs dual 4K monitor with DVI->HDMI adapter .,"I have been running this card for a while year in a desktop system with an Asus Z170-AR motherboard, and a pair of LG 4K monitors that have HDMI 2.0 inputs. I was able to use a DVI to HDMI adapter, and get 4K to work on the second connector. That was a nice surprise.

I am not a gamer, so I have not tried games. But I don't think you can beat the value for this card, until motherboards come standard with multiple HDMI 2.0 capable GPUs."

If your going to put CSM in the name of the product, maybe add a caveat that it is ONLY compatible with uefi enabled motherboards.

I should add that I run a very lean optimized system. I guess the most indicative thing I can say is my oldest nephew came over to visit, and like most kids these days ( I hear), he plays Fortnite. I don't have a modern console (in 2019), so I thought it nice when he said. ""Why does this look so much better than on our X Box 1?"" He doesn't have the upgraded version of the console, but I still thought it was neat that a kid noticed the difference between console and PC graphics, even when said PC has a budget GPU:)"

My review ...,"Ignore how many stars I gave this. My review has nothing to do with the capabilities of the card itself. Be aware of how much room you have inside your computer before you buy this. While it only takes one slot at the back of your computer, it may not fit inside your computer. In the first computer I tried, I could have forced it in, but it would have pressed right up against the wiring of the power supply connector on my motherboard, due to the placement of the power supply connector ABOVE the pcie slot. On the fitst computer, the pcie slot was at the top of the available slots. On the second computer where I tried to install it, the pcie slot was below two pci slots, and this card extended so far above the pcie slot that it couldn't be installed, because the slot above it was in the way - not a close fit, but impossible to install without removing the slot above it. (I'm not talking about the slot cover at the back of the computer. I am talking about the actual slot on the motherboard.) When installed, the ""blades"" of the passive cooling system extend 1.25 inches high. The vertical distance between my pcie slot and the next slot is slightly less than an inch."

838,8.0,Asus GeForce GT 710 2GB GDDR5 HDMI VGA DVI Graphics Card Graphic Cards GT710-SL-2GD5-CSM,ASUS Computer International Direct,NVIDIA,2 GB,954 MHz,$54.99,4.5 out of 5 stars,Good HTPC video card for 1920x1080,"I got this for my home theater computer, it's a first generation i5-650, so it needs help. I have a UHD (4k) TV and a FHD (1920x1080) monitor on the side. It runs about 40 deg C when idle and only about 57 deg C when busy. I have a large desktop PC case with only one fan in the case and one in the power supply.

I'm using it with Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and MythTV. 1920x1080 @ 60Hz looks great and the CPU load running MythTV with the ""VDPAU Advanced"" setting is almost nothing. A big improvement over the 9400 GT it replaced, and it only uses 40% of the power and there's no fan.

Netflix or YouTube at 1080 @ 60Hz work great - the CPU gets a little busy, but it handles it.

YouTube at 2160 @ 30Hz bogs and stutters. This card does not have VP9 codec support (used for YouTube 1440 & 2160 videos). I installed the Chrome extension H264ify so that YouTube will use H.264 codec for 1440 & 2160 videos and then they play smoothly, but the CPU is near max.

This card also does NOT support HEVC / H.265 which is used by Netflix for 4k video, and It cannot do 4k/60Hz. If you want good 4k/60Hz performance you need a GTX 950, which also supports HEVC for Netflix 4k."

I did that purposely so I could add my own preference of upgrades. I do have a work computer dedicated to high-end video, photo and graphics editing and another dedicated to gaming, but I wanted to be able to do both from time-to-time on my home PC where I usually work of projects.

That being said, no one including me will ever say this card is a high-end gaming/graphics card. It isn’t. But don’t believe that anything low-end is without merit, or as I saw one claim that the onboard video that comes with a basic computer is better than any low-end graphics card. Logic says that shared memory vs. dedicated memory and a card optimized for graphics can be a useful and valuable upgrade. Note that the company classifies this as a Corporate Stable Model. What does that mean? I asked and the answer was simply that products with that designation are designed for business to be compatible with a wide range of operating systems and hardware and to have enhanced product support not usually available with consumer-grade products. Maybe the most intriguing is what they call advance-swap – if you’re having trouble with your card they let you keep it in service until they send you a replacement, so you’re not left with a non-working computer for days or weeks. Owning a business I know that can mean running task-intensive software, the need for stable graphic performance, and the expectation that the components in a business computer likely will be powered on and often in use 24/7.

But which one to choose? There are so many brands with so many specs that sound similar but fall down when it comes to the quality of the components, which can result in intermittent performance, not actually achieving expected performance or early failure. So for me the place to start is with the ASUS brand name. The people who really know about graphics cards rarely disagree about the fact that this company is fanatical about quality.

After that decision I found that reading what others have to say doesn’t mean much, there are so many variables when it comes to every other component in their computer system, what apps they are using, how bogged down with apps their computer is, the list goes on … this is one product that I believe the only way to know if it is going to work for you is to get it and try it in your systems for your unique purposes.

So the first hint I think can be useful if you are in a daze and simply don’t know which one to choose is to look at the fine print above. Every item here has a date of first sale (you can actually do a sort by several parameters and one of them is to list the most recently added products in any category). You’ll find that some of the video graphics cards still being sold here can go back as far as Windows XP or even earlier. Not coincidentally, it seems the number one reason people say they aren’t satisfied with a graphics card is that it isn’t compatible with newer operating systems like WIN10. By buying a card like this that was designed and manufactured after WIN10 was introduced and has drivers included written for WIN10 you’ve upped your chances of 100% compatibility a lot and took a big step toward future compatibility as well.

So, after several weeks of research and saving at least a dozen semi-finalists to my cart, this is the one I chose. And I think I did good, it works extremely well, it’s such a breath of fresh air for something to just work like it’s supposed to.

Two final words of caution: I don’t have any problems with the most popular search engine that starts with G---, it’s always been my preferred search engine. But if you don’t want their chrome or their search bar option please note that both are set to install by default unless you catch it and opt out. You have to uncheck them if you don’t want them. The other heads-up is just my duh mistake – the card ships with a plastic protective piece over the contacts. I didn’t see it and tried to insert it into the motherboard. Hmm, it wouldn’t go into the slot. Hey, don’t laugh at me, at least I caught it before trying to force it in."

CSM means something totally different to ASUS, apparently. I thought it meant compatibility with older systems that don't use UEFI as their boot firmware. Apparently not. I plugged it in and there was no video output from the card. I installed all the drivers from the CD, website, etc under Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. Still nothing. Heat sinks got warm so I knew it was drawing power, and I have a 300w PSU (the minimum for the card according to the box). It said absolutely nothing about requiring UEFI. Now I'm stuck buying a different card for this PC.

I guess I'm lucky that my other desktop was compatible with this card, so it's not a total waste. But it did not work in the system it was intended for, which I found quite frustrating and disappointing. This is the first and last ASUS product I'll be buying, due to misleading advertising. Everything else was as advertised and quality is fine. But when the card won't display video output at all it's a bit of a show-stopper."

One of the components I chose for this build was the GT710 graphics card. I have a separate machine for work and gaming, so I really didn't need anything overkill, nor did I wanna break the bank on this thing. Upon doing some research, this seemed a like a great budget graphics card for someone that wants to run a large monitor and/or dual monitors on a budget. The benchmarks out there for the GT710 are great, and I think it's awesome that it also has 2GB of memory.

I originally purchased an MSI Geforce 710. I was quick to return it due to it having a very noisy fan (I specifically chose parts to build a very quite computer for music, but the graphics card is one thing I overlooked). Upon researching, I came across this model on Amazon, which features a larger heatsink and no fan. I ordered it. This thing works great!

This is an absolutely awesome graphics card if you want a nice and quiet computer, especially if you're making this for a home entertainment center or for music production like me. I simply have nothing bad to say about it. I'm just a huge fan of the fanless design. It's very low profile (pictured), plenty of space to install this in a Micro ATX build (I did remove one of the DVI screws to fit it in easier but this isn't a big hassle and is to be expected in tight cases like mine). Just a simple, small, and robust graphics card.

It does everything I need it to do, runs my desktop on 1080p, runs all my music programs great, I can watch movies and YouTube videos on here with ease. Despite being fanless, it has never overheated on me once. Just a great ""productivity class"" graphics card, I'd recommend it for office and light-duty graphical work. If you're eyeing this up for gaming, don't expect it to play games well. I'm sure this thing can do some low-level gaming, paired with a good CPU (I'm running and i3 9100f with this build). But don't expect it to run Battlefield or Metro. I do intend on testing a game on here soon just so see how well it holds up, and will post results on this. For games like Starcraft II, WoW, I think this thing may hold up pretty decently. But I'd recommend spending a little more in that category."

Old graphics card, about 5 years old now, started pooping out. I get this new one, pop it in, and now all problems with video and computer crashes are gone.

The new card is a ASUS GT710 2 gig, I put the card in and it locked the machine up. I tried many thing but it stops at starting windows and will sit forever..

I called Amazon they tried to help then connected me to ASUS they didn't have a clue and told me they do not have any techs available and they would call me back , they never did.

This is Junk , the card that came out is a Geforce 620 no problems . it even works if i put it back but this card does not work and there is no way to get it to work . Amazon shame on you for even selling this junk.

I am stuck with it now because I did not get a chance to install until yesterday if it says 30 days return policy not as
good idea to purchase it unless you install it the day it comes in. You would think Amazon would take into
consideration people go away during the summer if it had come in one day sooner I would of had time to find out it was junk. maybe it will work in one of my other computers , I would say it just isn't worth it........

I am updating this review if i could give this a new rating number it would be (NEGITIVE 5) stars.t has been about a week now and this junk is still junk.
I spent too many hours trying to get this running turns out this card ""DOES NOT WORK"" on HP computers. after researching everything it is a known bios problem with the 700 series cards and HP motherboards.

Thank you Amazon , you take money out of our pockets and fill our landfill with all the junk that does not work.
I think sometime it may be better to purchase local, at least you get it that day and have somewhere to return it when it doesn't work , and you almost never get returned stuff, or used junk that doesn't' work.

I am updating a second time , I did get the card to work , it took lots of work , no help from ASUS or amazon.

So purchase at your own risk.....if your other card is dead and you can not get back into the screens DO NOT PURCHASE this card it requires you to set up after the machine is booted, if you have no screen or the computer doesn't recognize the new card , you are out of luck."

You can only use a dedicated GPU for a second monitor in that system setup because the Integrated Graphics in the CPU will not allow you to run the main display off of the dedicated GPU. You will also need to modify several UEFI Bios settings and install the drivers from the manufacturer's website for the card to even be recognized in Windows 10 with the latest Creators' Update. I was able to make windows use the dedicated card as the main display, using a second monitor plugged into it, once I was booted up and logged in, but once you shut down and try to boot into windows again, you will be greeted with a nice black screen as the IGFX in the CPU takes over and hijacks the output signal again. The only option I have not tried is to disable the Vega11 dedicated driver while the settings in windows 10 are set to use the dedicated GPU as the main display. My theory, and my fear, is that it will still fail to recognize the dedicated card after a reboot, thus leaving me with no screen and no way to get back into windows to fix it because the dedicated graphics are disabled in device manager. I have ordered an external hard drive so I can create a complete disk image backup before I try it. Just know that you are going to have a fight on your hands if you try to use this card with this particular IGFX and an ASUS A320 MOBO using the Ryzen5 2400G Processor. Because of this hassle, I took the ratings down a notch, but you really can't blame the card for this problem, as all of the fault lies mainly with the fact that this processor and motherboard, along with the poor UEFI Bios settings options, are the real problem here. Also, if you are wondering why someone would put a card of this caliber into a computer with a dedicated GPU like the Ryzen5, it's because the Ryzen5 Vega 11 isn't all it's cracked up to be. My old windows XP computer that is 10 years old will play movies and games better than this chip. Maybe it's because it uses system memory and has to fight with all of the other system processes unlike dedicated cards with their own memory and processor capabilities. Anyhow, I hate the Ryzen5 and wish I could throw the computer it the trash and just shell out for a better one with an Intel chip and MOBO that will take a decent graphics card that will actually do the job right."

I went with a Dell 27 incher because Dell is a trusted quality brand and I got a great deal on Amazon. But now I needed a new graphics card because the stock one had no vga or hdmi connection.

After researching a bit I decided the GeForce GT 710 was likely to be compatible with no issues - plug and play on the Mac, with no need to install drivers or fuss around. With 2 gigs of ram it was also an upgrade from the original 512 card. I don't play games, just watch videos and do a lot of work in Photoshop, so 2GB is plenty for my needs.

The card was a cinch to install. The Macpro is brilliantly designed to be upgrade friendly. Switching out the old card and installing the new one took just a few minutes. I tested it with vga first, then switched to HDMI. Based on that quickie test I'd recommend using HDMI.

I opened some Photoshop work I had done before the old monitor died - and saw subtle details revealed by the upgraded graphic card that weren't apparent before. I'm sure the difference is due to the card, not the new monitor.

I tested some videos and again was impressed with both the color, which seemed more naturalistic, and the details. Very pleased with this card."

You probably have found that you cannot physically fit most graphics cards in your low profile computer, and this one will totally fit with the included adapter and a minute of changing out the brackets.

This card will not get you playing all the hottest 3D games though. This card will get you playing stuff thats 4-5 years old with MAYBE medium graphics settings. It will make it so you can play most 2D games comfortably, even newer ones, and your youtube videos can now be full screen without tearing and lag.

If you were hoping for newer 3D games, you need to buy a new computer. One that isn't low profile."

Do NOT buy this card !!!,This card is an absolute waste of money. Don't let specs fool you. I purchased it for World of Warcraft BFA hoping to upgrade my old Nvidia GTS 250 which is a 512MB / DDR3 card. I could run BFA at graphics level # 7 at 53FPS with that card.

The on-board Radeon 4200 video was very sluggish and bogged down my AMD Quad Core in Win10 with 5 gB RAM. In fact, it would not (no matter what driver), fill the full screen of a 27"" monitor at 1080p.

This is not a gaming application, but more for flat graphics (like an SDR Waterfall Display of radio signals). After installing this card and the accompanying driver, my processor load dropped from 30% to 18%, the video was much sharper (text/fonts more easily read), and the sluggishness I had been experiencing with the motherboard video disappeared. For some reason, the contrast on the display is also much better, making text easier to read.

The big plus was I did not have to upgrade my power supply in the tower. The fact that it does not use a fan, but rather a large heat sink was also nice.

For my purposes, this was a good investment, and a perfect fit to my applications. It was $30 or so when I bought it, I see it has gone up, since then.

Overall, could not be more pleased, not because it is the greatest graphic card in the world, but it outperforms the motherboard graphics by a lot, works with existing power supply and didn't cost a fortune."

This was a breeze to install. I just swapped out the bracket for the low profile one that came with the card and it went in easily (with the large cooling fins you do need extra room, my computer had 2 slots so I put it in the side that allowed the fins to stick out over the other slot). I had already downloaded the newest drivers from the NVIDIA website so it was a breeze to get it up and running. This wouldn't be ideal for video games, but since I am just using it for streaming video, it is a very effective and inexpensive solution. Update, I also purchased a refurbished small HP and another of these video cards. It works great for streaming on that computer as well. Perfect silent card which worked great with the included low profile brackets for both computers."

The ASUS GeForce 210 was that answer. It has no fan, so it's completely silent (something I value in an HTPC). It has enough power to handle 1080p video and output 5.1 DTS without any hiccups (depending on your CPU, as well, I'd imagine). It's easy to install, supports half-height bays if you have a slim HTPC, and doesn't require any extra power connections.

The drivers provided are a bit old, so you'll want to ignore the CD that comes with this and download the latest GeForce drivers for this device. Understand also that this won't work with Nvidia's game optimizing software. In truth, you wouldn't want this for gaming. It can handle some recent games on lowest settings (and still lags) but this is not really a gamers' video card.

However, for an HTPC or standard office PC that just needs a replacement for on-board video, this is a step up from some of the legacy onboard chipsets you'll find out there. It does a great job with Kodi, Netflix, Hulu Plus, VLC, and YouTube. I've played 1080p H.264 and HEVC with no issues, and it gets along with my Yamaha receiver and Epson projector, too, which is important in an HTPC graphics card.

Bottom line: It does what I expected it to do. It works great for an HTPC and the price was fantastic. If you just need a basic card for HD video, this would be a good choice."

For example, Skyrim is a 9 year-old game, but even on the lowest video display settings this card can not cope with the demand.

The 210 GPU device is significantly SLOWER than my on-board graphics -- the one that's built into the CPU. You can see for yourself by running the Windows Experience Index. It'sbuilt into XP, Win7, and Windows10 (see below). Please know that I am NOT a gamer, and so am not approaching this from any ""Need for Speed"" -- only a guy who wanted to get an HDMI connection for his monitor. Don't waste your money!

If your computer is pretty old and has only VGA output to your monitor or TV, this might possibly suit your needs.for hookup. But it won't be much of an improvement -- if any -- and it costs more than simple alternatives Consider these options instead: Your VGA output, with an inexpensive adapter to HDMI will work fine, though you will need to run audio through a separate cable. For Display Port (DP) connection, just get an adapter to HDMI. It will have audio connection built in. The same is true for DVI -- just get an adapter. Many are less than $10.00.

Now, about the simple test. Wikipedia has an excellent article on the Windows Experience Index, and spells out the different test ranges for XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, and even Windows 8. The scale (or range) for each operating system is slightly different, and Windows 8 is kind of unwieldy. But just run the test from the Control Panel -- System and Security. Write down your present values (there are five) before installing this card. Get it running and then run the test again. It's Slower! All you did was spend extra money!

By the way, ASUS support is pretty much a joke. After you get through deciphering the telephone tree (which likely will take several tries) you get someone who will issue you a ""Case number"". You don't get any actual help, as these folks just assemble the card (in China). If you try to get help from nVidia or GeForce, their website allows you to update the drivers for your card.

This card was the last piece of the system - I needed something that could output secure HDMI so that I could replay copy protected content, and I wanted something with no fan (so that it was quieter) and that used as little electricity as possible, especially while idle.

The card is everything I could want - it was compatible, easy to install, it's low power and silent, and it is working great with my PC and TV.

A couple tips:

1) This unit is fanless - it just has that giant finned heat sink attached to it. It might not fit in thin PCs, and it would be tough to put a card next to it. On the other hand, I love that it has no fan - there are no moving parts to go wrong, and I want my media center PC to be quiet.

2) It's an old card, so I'm sure it wouldn't run most modern games. But again, that's a plus for my purposes - it uses less electricity and produces less heat than a more powerful card.

3) It was able to rum my HDMI TV and my old VGA monitor simultaneously, which was cool, but WMC wouldn't play protected content while I had the unsecure monitor plugged in, so now I'm using the TV as a monitor.

4) I did some googling on similar cards. From what I can tell, the 210 is a little better than the  GeForce 8400GS , so I picked the 210 over that. It looks like the  Radeon 5450  and 6450 *might* be a little better, but those were pricier and harder to get, so I ultimately chose the 210. So far, no complaints!"

It comes with a variety of covers to fit any machine and was super easy to reconfigure to fit my Mini ITX case. It installed in seconds, driver disk comes with the item so no hunting online or links that don't work. I don't think it has got the power to run the most demanding current games but at this price... come on! it has VGA, HD, and DVI. You really cannot beat this for the price. if you are doing a budget build.... get this card."

To take advantage of the higher resolution I decided upgrade the graphics with an ASUS GT 710. According to my research it should work. Well, it didn't. Turns out the problem was the lack of UEFI compliance for the PCIe slot. Bit of background: HP phased in UEFI gradually over a period of years starting about 2012. Graphics card for this period were (usually?) compliant with both UEFI and non-UFEI system. A few had a switch to select the booting method. But as the years have passed graphic card manufacturers have dropped the non-UEFI option, so they all (or mostly all?) won't work if the system is non-UEFI. And my old desktop was non-UEFI. So rather than send the card back to Amazon I installed it in my wife's personal desktop. Works swell on her machine.

So I give this product only three stars because Asus should have had a warning on the box: “UEFI compliant systems only.”"

Asus isn't a junk unknown brand for one, two I can't speak for gaming, but as far as picture quality, sound quality and overall performance, not to mention the price, this GCard is a beast!! I've read reviews claiming it plays games such as Fortnite and GTA5 but they didn't specify performance nor the quality settings themselves (High/Low) so I cannot stress enough I haven't tested any games!! I can say with two gigs of ram, it is possible. Now back to the specifics; I popped this badboy in a Dell Optiplex 790 with Windows 10 64bit and had ZERO problems with anything, installed the card and booted up my pc and there was my beautiful 1080p HD display, in my situation I didn't need the installation disk provided as it booted right up and I further updated the drivers through windows settings. Very small card but most certainly packs power. Currently using the HDMI and DVI port for dual displays and both of which provide crisp, clean video and sound; haven't tried the VGA port but I've been led to believe there will be no surprises. AGAIN I've only been using the card for a few hours now, actually typing this using said graphics card, and cannot speak for the long run; but as said before, I'm certain this card will last as long as I need its services. Hope this was helpful and maybe made a decision or two.. I was skeptical too but I took one for the team and am beyond pleased for the low price of $54; fantastic for simple everyday PC use (Office, theatre, or just an everyday desktop would love this upgrade suggesting you have something inferior) BE SURE TO RESEARCH YOUR SPECIFIC DESKTOP TO MAKE SURE OF COMPATIBILITY JUST INCASE!!!!

Unlike other reviewers,"I have a relatively old HP dc5800 SFF desktop that was in need of upgraded graphics for videos and because it was not displaying Windows 10 properly. In any case, I needed a card that was quiet, had low power requirements and would fit properly in a low profile case. Based on the description and comments of others, this seemed to fit the bill. Well...it was almost perfect. Unlike other reviewers, my card did not include the full and low profile adapter, so I was forced to modify the full sized adapter and secure it in my PC with a little yankee ingenuity (yes, I could purchase the lowpro adapter for another $6 or $7 - but if I wanted to spend more I would have just sent it back and bought a different card.

Aside from that, I have no complaints - video (Netflix, Plex, etc) looks great - a major step up from VGA that I had gotten used to. Windows 10 does not have the pixelation I had been experiencing using my outdated onboard graphics. All in all, a good product (maybe a great product in a bigger, better, faster rig) at a decent price."

This card worked perfectly and we have been using it for about a month now without any problems whatsoever. In one monitor I have a PowerPoint slideshow (Presenter View), in another I have that PowerPoint presentation open so I can make changes on the fly, and in the third I have OpenLP so that I can interject images or Bible verses. Glad I bought this card!"

Quiet/ no fan is a huge plus for me.,"I had an MSI video card that has worked just fine, picky with installing drivers at first, but once setup worked as I needed it to.... until... one morning I came in and heard the noise of doom.... the fan was on its way out. At this point I decided that for this system I was going to look for a card without a fan, only a heatsink..... and I found it. It was also a requirement that I had a DVI and HDMI output for my two monitors that I have.

I received it, installed it and from the first boot it worked. Installed the drivers only as I really do not need (or better said, want!) any other stuff on my system, and at that point both monitors were working. One reboot, one driver update, and done. Total downtime was less than 5-min.

Compared to the MSI video card that I had, this one works exactly the same as far as clarity, speed, etc except no fan, only a big heatsink. Now my system runs quiet and I am happy with it. The software is also light years ahead of what came with my MSI card--- it actually worked from the start.

After some time with it, I am definitely happy with it. I will at times stream movies at lunch time and no dropped frames or any other issues. Another bonus is my system as a whole is definitely running cooler. I know when the fan on my previous card was working--- the system at times would run warm. So either the fan was undersized or it was running it flat out all the time... not sure and honestly does not matter anymore!"
865,8.0,Asus GeForce GT 710 2GB GDDR5 HDMI VGA DVI Graphics Card Graphic Cards GT710-SL-2GD5-CSM,ASUS Computer International Direct,NVIDIA,2 GB,954 MHz,$54.99,4.5 out of 5 stars,These are very nice for 1080p media applications.,"I have two of these now. I use them in small form factor PCs that are used as media machines for HD projectors. I like these because they are more than sufficient for 1080P purposes and the fan-less heat-sink keeps it plenty cool. I also have one in a media room with both a monitor and a projector.

I don't game so I can't speak to that but they have no issues playing 1080p video with zero lag and the dual/triple display option comes in handy.

This isn't a drawback for me since I don't use it but, if you are going to use these in a low-profile machine, you can only use 2 of the displays. One back plate comes with an HDMI/DVI configuration and the other plate is just VGA only. The full length back-plate that comes installed facilitates all three. It will also pretty much tie up two slots worth of space because of the heat-sink."

I popped this replacement in easily. It took up much less space. My goal was not to upgrade, but just to get my computer working close to the level it was before.

Since someone mentioned their Windows Experience score dropping, I checked mine. Graphics increased from 4.8 to 4.9. Gaming graphics stayed at 5.7.

Calling the instructions lacking is generous. Luckily you really don't need them. Just disconnect everything, ground yourself, disconnect any power cables to the old card. Remove the screw holding the expansion card cover on the back of the machine, remove the old card - be sure to push the release on the PCIex16 slot. Slide the new card in (there are NO power connections for the new card), screw on the expansion card holder. Hook everything back up, turn on your machine. I did not use the installation disk. Upon booting up (it defaulted to VGA) drivers started downloading immediately and finished in about 5 minutes. The machine then rebooted, and came up in 1900x1200. The system recommended a 250MB download from Nvida. I downloaded the update, and everything is fine. Note I took the opportunity to load a new system battery while the card was out.....this did cause an error on the first boot up I assume because data was lost. The BIOS opened and I reset it.

Positives: Easy install. Takes up much less space. No Fan. NO BSODs. No power cables.
Negative: The heat sink overlaps one slot, not that I care.

I am not a gamer. I use my computer primarily for pictures. It flies through them just as fast as before.

As always, if the product fails, I will update the review and downgrade it accordingly. Day 1 11-01-2013."

I use it in an old dual core computer to hook the computer up to dual monitor /TV setups so I can cut the cord.

This series of video cards allow me to run the dual monitor function of a Windows 7 computer. I hooked a 32 in monitor to one port and a 60 inch tv to the other port. Then I am able to stream from the internet to the TV and also look up stuff on the internet at the same time.

Also, using this card, I can use the 32 in monitor to stream 4 ESPN channel views and have a primary game playing on the 60 inch TV at the same time. Turn on close caption for the 4 windowed games and listen to the sound on the main game on the big set.

This video card is perfect for running DUAL Monitor setup.

My Computer Setup: Dual Core CPU (Intel), Haugpauge TV turner card, ASUS GeForce video card, 4GB memory in computer. Window 7.
I have a 32in monitor and 60 in tv hooked up to the computer. I am able to watch / record two channels of broadcast tv plus watch a 3rd channel on the 60 in tv from a $9 antenna. I am also able to record / download and lookup on the internet while all of this is running.

I can record broadcast tv and watch HULU plus Netflix plus Amazon Prime at the same time. So, recording two shows plus watching additional show(s) is possible. This video card makes the video experience happen. A MUST HAVE!"

Actually physically installing was a snap, literally.

However, upon bootup, the system only recognized it as a generic VGA card. It did work, just not that well. (No sound and poor picture quality.)

So, I had to download the NVIDIA drivers from the manufacturer's web-site and update both the audio and video drivers. I then had to select the video card's audio as the system default.

Other than that, I had to upgrade the power supply on my computer to make this work. I bought an inexpensive power supply to replace the 250W that came standard with my dell system.

The result: video works a lot better, now. My old machine just didn't have the horsepower to, for instance, play MKV files with XBMC, when it had to try and do it with the built-in video interface.

For the money, this was a great upgrade to do. Just make sure your power supply can handle it or get a new power supply.

If I had it all to do over again, I would have no problem doing it exactly this way."

It works! The video is just fine (as expected). I could probably use the VGA to extend to a third monitor, as someone else reported they have done. I don't need three (yet).

UPDATE: I forgot to mention that this card is preventing my computer from fully awakening from hibernate. I have the latest drivers as of 2016-09-14. Standby works though. I have deducted one star for the hibernate problem.

I am not a gamer, but use this PC for PCB design, and electronic circuit design (embedded systems). This card is just fine for that, probably gaming too. I like that it's passively cooled. Unfortunately the heatsink is under the board, as it would be in all vertically-oriented tower cases. That raises the temps I am sure."

Gave up after 2 days and I am pretty computer literate.
Sending it back and looking for something better.
EDIT - I tried this again after thinking maybe the VGA output was cutting out the HDMI output so connected my monitor with DVI to VGA adapter as I do now with my current card. Spent another 4 hours trying everything I know of to get it to recognize HDMI output. Never did, so back in the box to Amazon."

This was to upgrade video to play World of Warcraft. Integrated video was 4gb, but the chipset was not sufficient. Keeps cool in a mini-tower w/o any problem. MUCH smaller than the description. In mini-tower, takes up 2 slots, HOWEVER, comes with the mini-tower pieces and screws!

NOTE: it defaults to DVI, so unless you have the adapter (NOT included) learn to boot to windows w/o monitor working, Once booted up (Windows 10 experience only here, but there are notes of this in other reviews) it will ""find"" the connected monitor slot (VGA/HDMI/DVI) and it will load a default driver for it, enabling the screen to install drivers (Included).

1-They work with small form factor computers by providing two, smaller plates which moves the VGA jack to the next space.
2-Being that this card uses a large heat sync rather than a cooling fan, it's power requirements are low, and it would work with the smaller power supplies that are typical in the small form factor computers.

The card installed easily and works perfectly. It allows me to run dual monitors on two of my work computers, and gives me HDMI capability. Some of the newer monitors are phasing out DVI in favor of HDMI, so it's wise to prepare for this if you are replacing or upgrading your video card.

I needed HDMI so I considered this video card. I did not want to spend a lot because the computer was not all that new. I already upgraded the memory and disk and installed Windows 7 on the computer so I thought I would give this video card a try. I installed the card and automatically (under Windows 7) all the driver software for both video and audio was installed through Windows update. After a few minutes I had video through the DVI and HDMI ports and easily connected to my Samsung flat screen TV. My intention was to use Xfinity on the computer to watch TV on the large TV. Works perfectly. You do have to select how you want the screens to be displayed. I wanted both screens (the desktop and the TV) because the TV is in the other room. The other thing is the audio can be passed to the TV through the HDMI cable but you can't have both the computer speakers and HDMI audio at the same time. This card was a no-brainer.

Works great with a Ceton InfiniTV 4 PCIe card and Windows 7 Media Center to provide full DVR experience to my TV with my Comcast cable system. Audio and video quality are great, haven't had any issue. Drivers are stable, I never have to reboot except for Microsoft Patch Tuesdays (I got this mainly because my on-board digital audio drivers kept crashing the system, and Intel didn't support the motherboard officially on Win7). Nice to have native HDMI, one cable for video and audio is a definite bonus.

Cons: The only con is that there's no way to override the HDMI's hardware detection profiles. There's no way to broadcast ""native"" 5.1 through my TV's passthrough to my receiver, which unfortunately itself doesn't have HDMI, because the TV only has stereo speakers internally itself. It's not really an issue when playback is from a Dolby-supportive app like Windows Media Center, since it does properly pass through Dolby Digital and Dolby Prologic messaging to the receiver, but it is an issue if you want to support surround sound from any source that doesn't provide native Dolby signalling. However, from my understanding, this is a problem with all NVidia chipset cards at the base driver level, not just this particular card, and really is a problem with HDMI specifications in general."

This is just a cheapish video card that I wanted to throw into an old machine that I was going to run using Linux. The responsiveness is amazing. VERY fast. Mind you I am not playing games with this card. But as a desktop/office video card it works extremely well and I can hardly see how you can go wrong.

One thing that I wasn't quite expecting, the heat sink is gigantic. You can kind of see that in the picture. On my mother board it was a tight fit as the heat sink ran right smack into my main motherboard power connector. I was just able to squeeze it in, but considered trimming off some of the heat sink, but in the end I did not need to.

PROS:
-FAST for desktop use
-Lots of memory
-No fan, so dead silent
-Cheap!

MAYBE CONS:
-Very large heat sink (make sure it will fit"

What was frustrating at first was that I thought the product had lied because it would not fit my slim case. It was just too big. However, I read the directions and lo and behold the smart people were spot on, the card comes with adaptors that let you separate the VGA section from the cards main body. It had all the appropriate video card parts to do a single bigger or double small card insert. If you don't need the VGA you can also remove it with the cable. The graphics are not high end, but they are great for the my day to day gaming and civilization strategy games. Oh bonus was that it functions good with an under powered case i.e. i am using an old 250w gaming rig and no complaints."

Looked this up on amazon, just wanted a basic card. Installed easily (no extra power cable needed). Booted up fine and I was able to pass the Win 10 test and install Windows 10.

Couple notes...
--It plugs into one PCI-e slot, but is so large it covers at least one if not almost two other slots. Keep this in mind. You'll need lots of room for the heatsink.
--the software install was weird... took forever and left me with a bunch of hidden software that would show up. I ended up uninstalling it all and juts let Windows find the right driver."

Would recommend for anyone with a desktop with a x16 PCIe slot and a 220w or better PSU.

Installed easily and works fine in both boxes. Using in an HP Compaq 6000 Pro Microtower and an HP Compaq dc5800 Small Form Factor PC (running Win7 Pro and 8 GBs of RAM; DDR2 in dc5800 & DDR3 in 6000 Pro). Needed the low profile for the dc5800; the heatsink does take up room so I'm unable to use the PCI and one PCI/e in the dc5800 and covers the two PCI/e's in the 6000. Not an issue for my application but might affect others.

The software includes a number of things I'll probably never use including overclocking and the ability to save different video profiles. I just want it to download and install the latest driver which was unsuccessful when I tried it in both boxes. Downloaded the latest driver directly from the NVIDIA site and installed with no issues.

4 stars for decent price, value, low profile ready, and fairly easy install. Seems to work fine for someone who needs a silent graphics card upgrade."

No dust anywhere, no overheating issues. Steer clear, not worth it.

I installed it on my Asus HT Deluxe home theater PC with WIndows 7 54 bit. I did use the enclosed CD for driver installation. After that, it automatically starts to import updates via WIndows update utilities. It appears to make a great difference between using a stand alone card and using the on-board HDMi which uses MB and RAM resources. The card releases those resources. It does have HDMi, VGA, and S-Video outputs. I GB of memory is nice too. Blu-ray 10280p on my Pioneer Elite 42 inch plasma is excellent. Essentially, this is simply too easy not to get one as just about all settings are set automatically. The sound comes through the HDMi automatically though I do not know whether 5.1 or 7.1 will go through. Typically, the sound is stereo. I use my PC's SPDIF digital out to my receiver for audio purposes and allow my Pioneer Elite VSX-59txi receiver do all the decoding including WMA-Pro. Enjoy the Music!"

I did have to replace the bracket before installing since I have a small case, but all needed parts were supplied with the card. All it took was booting up and installing the driver CD. Card works much better than the onboard video that came with my MSI motherboard. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to low priced video card for a home theatre PC.
The real reason I purchased this card was because the onboard MSI video didn't with work XBMCUbuntu, which I'm reviewing as a possible replacement for Windows Media Center. The card works great, so after poking around a bit, I may make the switch to XBMC. Windows Media Center really is a pretty terrible user experience, and if XBMC has all the features I'm interested in, then it's bye-bye Windows 7 for my home theatre."

Exactly what as was looking for. Not expensive and an upgrade for playing videos and light gaming. The only negative thing I would say is that the instructions on how to physically install the card were poor. I am not all that computer savvy. I have only bought 3-4 graphics cards. It took me awhile to realize that you can change the brackets around to make it fit into the slot. Also quick note. I have a low profile (very thin) tower and this card took two card slots to fit properly in the back. The D-Sub Output (I believe it called) can be removed and put above the actual card in a separate slot. So If you don't have the space and you are looking for a low profile card this might not be for you. In the picture it shows how I had to install my card.

It does a fine job. Except for heat problem. My case is a Asus case and is well vented. I find that after a hour or so of play temp will rise to 70* C and above (170 + F) that seems very much too hot for me--- so I am installing a PCI slot fan. Again my case is well vented and temp around it is never above 78* F. Would give 5 stars except for this issue. I realise same card can be bought with its own fan. However I still like option of installing my own --then if it get's noisy --etc- I can easly replace it.

Added comment Installed Vantec SP-FC70-BL Spectrum System Fan Card with Dual Adjustable 70mm UV LED Fans - and it has done a fine job -good for card and comp, card runs Diablo III at 1280X720 with all effects on high. Does this with no over-clocking Looks-and plays great.stays cool now---"

No problem! I took off the heat sink and replaced it with the old board's heat sink. I just ruined the warranty, but at this low price, who cares?

After upgrading to Windows 10 and using the drivers windows automatically installed I now no longer get crackle when shutting down. Now this card is PERFECT.

I use this for my home built HTPC I cobbled together from a few old Gateway mini towers. The only issue I have is that when I put the PC to sleep or shut down my Logitech Z-680 speakers crackle because for some reason the HDMI is still on until the computer is fully OFF and done going to sleep. Slight design flaw. It would also be nice if it supported HDMI-CEC but no video cards currently do."

This card is compatible with WIN 7 and performs very well for the price. There is no cooling fan so the unit is silent - a great advantage. Consequently, a large heat sink is needed. Strangely, this heatsink is not only pretty big, but the cooling fins have very sharp edges. Also, the unit is so thick that, in many computers, it will need two slots to accomodate it. Note that the heat sink is not (electrically) insulated and might short nearby circuit connections if not installed with care. Apart from these issues, I recommend this card as it works well and in complete silence."

I had no problem setting this up. You can download the latest NVIDIA drivers, and roll. I've seen a major computer manufacturer sell a work computer with a lesser model card for $26 more.

With Windows 7, this is a reasonably priced video card solution. I don't know about heavy gaming, but my son likes it for his on-line games. My Linux Mint (Debian edition) had no problem with this card. Nice card at the lower end.

The heat sink is rather large, so be aware of that. But it should fit even micro-ATX boxes.

I had read that a lot of these were opened and never used and returned. It's easy to understand why - the metal fins used to cool the processor extend out perpendicular to the board 2 or 3 inches. This likely caused a space problem. I had to trim some of the fins to make the card fit in a Dell Optiplex . It wasn't hard, though. I think the fins are made of aluminum, so you can notch it with a diagonal wire cutters, then bend back and forth until the fin comes right off, pretty clean. I just trimmed enough off so that none of the fins were touching any of the other components. Works like a charm. Nice video for games, though we haven't used it for anything too challenging yet.."

I recently installed Microsoft FSX (Flight Simulator) and while the PC could play the game it was at a very low detail level. So since I am a casual player and really did not need a high end card to play only one game. I am very impressed with this video card, the install was very straight forward no issues with drivers or FSX. I am able to now play the game at 80% boosted graphics and its such a nice looking game.

I wanted something that would be compatible with their NVIDIA proprietary driver packages, the usual video players, and Google Earth. I'm not a gamer, so NVIDIA's entry-level products were a good match for my needs.

I initially considered a GT 430, but that turned out to be too demanding for the power supply I had. So, it really came down to a choice between a 210 and a GT 520. The 210 had a couple of things going for it: (1) it would also work with Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS, which is still supported; (2) it's a little less expensive; (3) it was available in a fanless/silent product, which was really attractive for a machine that would be used in a quiet residential environment.

I tend to be somewhat brand-loyal to EVGA, but their silent 210 got terrible reviews -- and not just here. The word on the street was their conventional version with the fan was OK, but if I wanted passive cooling, ASUS was the way to go.

I've been using this for six months now, and it has performed flawlessly. The only downside is it blocks a PCI-E x1 slot (which I wasn't using).

If I were making a similar purchase decision today, it would be between this and a GT 610."

The best part is that there is no fan and hence no noise. The worst part is that the heat sink is quite large, projecting 1 3/8"" from the surface of the card; the bottom of the heat sink is also less than 1/8"" above the top of the PCIe connector so tall parts on the motherboard could interfere.

It works great! Had a problem with horizontal syncing during fast action sequences on movies, couldn't play HD. This really solved the problem, as everything runs very smooth now. After 8 months of use, it does stutter at times, freezing all operability at full-screen for about 2 minutes. The heat sink is gargantuan, and takes up the extra PCI slot, so be aware of that. However, the heat sink is great and I didn't realize how loud the old Video card was until this was installed. Now I can barely hear the HTPC when it's running!"

Pros; Silent, inexpensive, reliable, fairly low power(~30W), Linux drivers available, a upgrade over 6150SE.

Cons: Bulky heat sink can crowd tight cases or adjacent PCI cards, subpar 3D performance, may not be an upgrade over newer integrated graphics chipsets."

I selected this one because it does (see below) and because it was small enough to fit in my Aunt's smaller form desktop tower (it includes mini brackets). It was a nice upgrade for her. It supports VGA, DVI, and HDMI, though I had to use a DVI to VGA adapter (not included) since having the native VGA port connection made the card too tall to fit.

I just set this up in a Linux HTPC running XBMC and it is playing 1080p content without an issue. I have a gt430 and it has a fan that is really loud which is annoying I really like the fan-less set up this card has. Basically if you are wanting a low profile card for a HTPC set up Linux or Windows this will do the job just fine. Also it does come with a low profile bracket.

Cons:
- A little hard to hold when installing because of the gigantic spiky heat sink on one side

I was really worried about the size from some of the pictures as I have a small case and the heat sink is rather large, but the picture of the back looking straight at the monitor connections makes it look like the heat sink does NOT protrude past the width of the end plate. In reality, it does, by a lot. My case would not fit back together as a result.

Instead of giving up, I got on the phone with Gigabyte support.

Sure enough, one BIOS update later, and I'm using the RX580 at its full capacity and killing it with high resolution and high frame rates.

He uses it to edit/crest video and for gaming. It’s 2 plates thick and fits nicely in its slot with plenty of room and airflow between. If you drop it in the top slot on this motherboard it will cover the M2A slot but hasn't affected temperatures so I wouldn’t call it a con. Although another plate on the other side would have been nice as mentioned in another post (most cards I use don’t have one and never really thought about it) I have a sound card in the slot above so he can use his recording interface so it looks fine to me. As far as noise, no complaints, although I haven’t tested it under extreme conditions during regular game play and video editing you wouldn’t know it’s on if it didn’t have the led.

(UPDATE!!!!),"UPDATE!!!!.... I found out what the issue is. It's not the card, it's the fans. They're not heat censored, so therefore they basically work when you're using a lot of things at once, but if you're not using much and it's hot out, it will lag and crash....

Well it was fine while it lasted... Which was about 3 months! Actually I think it started happening about 2 months in, but it's been 3 months so far until I realized it was the card. I thought that it was my internet that was giving me blank screens and freezing, but it turns out it was this card. From reading a lot of the reviews, seems like many are having that same issue. Not sure if they know they're sending out duds, or they just have really bad luck with them because although I got this for about $30 less than what it is now on sale, I feel it was still a rip off because it's only good for a few months and even then it wasn't the best. Was okay, but not the best. I would recommend buying something a little more expensive that will last you a lot longer, but if you're looking for a card that will last for a little while and then freeze a lot, then this is your best choice... I'm disappointed in MSI because they usually have good products, but this was a huge downfall from the high hopes I had about this. Just wish I knew this before I bought it because I would have gladly payed double for something a lot better and would last a lot longer... It's been about 4 months so I can't return it. Just wish they would at least be honest about their products rather than ripping people off. Very disappointing... :("

I recommend PCH MICRO highly!,"I order the GTX 1050 from PCH. The gpu arrived 5 days earlier than estimated and I immediately installed it to run my flight sim. Installation was easy. It only took me about 20 minutes and I'm not a tech guy at all. I only bought my computer two years ago to play IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad. The developers have made significant improvements to the game in that time and I found that the gtx 750ti that came with the computer could no longer handle graphics load without
a huge decrease in frame rate.
After I installed the gtx 1050 oc I was disappointed that I experience only a slight improvement. After trying many different game settings I only got a little more improvement by going for lowest settings. I contacted the seller thru amazon and asked for a refund. That was on a Friday. Over the weekend I watched a youtube video on how to over-clock my gpu using the After-burner utility. The result is that I now have zero issues with the performance I'm getting.
I get amazingly sharp images and smooth as silk play on High graphics settings.
Today is Tuesday and I got a reply from PCH apologizing for the problems I described and they offered to immediately accept my return and issue a full refund. Their return policy and service is excellent and I highly recommend them!"

The first 1050 ti I owned was Zotac's OC model, which was a fine card. The only issue with it was that the fans couldn't go any lower than 45% speed, and it was a little too noisy for me at any load. I decided to purchase this card instead as a replacement. Here are my thoughts:

+ The card runs semi-passively under its default fan profile. Even at 35% fan speed, it is completely inaudible in my small custom wooden itx case.
+ It's a 1050 ti- you'd have to try hard to get it to thermal throttle. It runs cool.
+ The aesthetics appeal to me. It's a pretty sharp-looking card.

+/- Is the 6-pin connector really necessary? Zotac's OC card was able to reach pretty high clocks using only motherboard slot power.
+/- At this price point, they could have gone the extra inch to include a backplate. Gigabyte managed to do it with their flagship 1050 ti.

- Speaking of price, it's hard to justify buying this specific card over a cheaper 1050 ti (usually smaller and without a 6-pin) or one of the less robust RX 470's at MSRP."

It did come with a low profile bracket, which I needed for my compact machine. It also seems to work fine with the small factory 375W power supply (and it gets all its power off PCIe, so no extra power connections required). With a modest i5 processor, this is now a true gaming machine with speed, higher resolution, and lots of effects. Highly recommended, especially if you have a low profile factory case and limited power supply.

 ***Posting for all the parts used in the build so excuse me if you’ve read this on a other component review.*++

The instructions were easy to read andI was able to install it on the first try. My husband and I built a customer computer for me to use instead of buying one that was overpriced and limits my options like a IMac, MacBook or box PC Gaming station. It turned out amazing!!!!! I teach ESL and use a program called ManyCam that is very CPU heavy and slowed down the original computer I was using. Also, trying to edit video was a terrible experience.

I took to gaming just ten years ago on my then PS3. I enjoyed the games back then because, they were fun. Today's games are full of loot boxes and other stuff to keep you spending tons of money. I don't like the new monitized games.

I like old sinlge player campaign games like Bioshock 1 and 2, Prototype 1 and 2, RAGE 1 and 2 and more. I like some new games. I can wait till Outter Worlds comes to steam. This MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB is all you need if you are playing older video games. My frame rates stay well over 75 FPS (Frames Per Second) using this GPU. Next the MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB runs cool compared to some of the 2060, 2070 and 2080 GPU's.

This card might struggle a bit playing some of the huge new open world games depending on your build. I have a Ryzen 9 XT running on a good motherboard giving me a CINEBENCH Score slightly faster than an entry threadripper. The single player PC game that shows how well a GPU card works for me is driving the cards in original RAGE! Driving cars in RAGE using this card is fantastic. There is no screen tearing, no artifacts, no lag, no crazy pop in's. The image is smooth. Best of all the overall PC Rage image quality is better than it was on my PS3 and the PS3 was fine.

If you intend to jump into Fortnight and other modern multiplayer gaming opportunities buy a better GPU. However if you are seriously into single player titles or older titles this MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB GPU is for you. Back when I first got into gaming the question that defined GPU quality was, ""Can it run CRYSIS?"" Turns out I ran CRYSIS using my MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB GPU and it ran fine. No lag or other issues. For a nice mid range GPU this is an awesome card so awesome in fact I brought three of them. My other video card is a MSI GEFORCE 2070 Super."

This graphics card is massive. You may need to make some adjustments if you have a standard desktop case. I had to crimp down a notch on one of the expansion slots in the back so the card would seat perfectly in the motherboard interface. I just used a small pair of pliers to complete this. Take the time to learn the layout of your chipset and case and be very gentle when installing this card. While it is not flimsy, the card pins on the bottom are somewhat obscured by the fan shroud and headers (yeah, you read that right😁). For some reason, my card didn't come with an installation CD. No big deal. Just go to the NIVIDIA website and download the latest software which optimizes game settings for you. Next thing: power. You'll need at least a 500w power supply. I use the EVGA which comes with a 6 pin molex connector that plugs right into this graphics card. NOTE: if you have anything other than an ATX motherboard, you're going to need a 20+4 pin to P2 adapter which is available right here on Amazon. Now for the fun stuff.
What's your game: Fortnite? Apex Legends? Call of Duty? At GDDR 5 with 4 GB of RAM, this game plays the above games at high and epic settings with ease and runs as quiet as the internal fans. NOTE: this card does tend to whir in a standard desktop case. Not to worry. I just removed the side panel and the card stays cool and very quiet. To add, when you run games like Fortnite on optimal settings, you may experience some freeze frames. THAT'S NOT YOUR GRAPHICS CARD - IT'S YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION. I have experienced this with both ethernet and wireless so I tested the speed of my internet connection and sure enough, I'm just under 10MB which is not optimal for online gaming. Nonetheless, I make due by lowering the settings a bit which compensates well. Lastly, the price point. Hands down, the best card you can buy for the money and performance output which trumps other cards within its price range. Overall, I am very happy with this card. It has revolutionized my gaming experience and I know it will do the same for you."

I needed a card that would offer significant performance but not take much power from the power supply. We are on a budget for setting up the systems and the main recreational interest was for playing Black Desert. In addition to easy install the boards feel right, look great and the parts and assembly processes are just fantastic. I also had to check one of the computers while it was operating the game and there was so little heat generated by the large heat sink on board that I was nothing short of amazed. More like I would design something (To Last) The software for the card is also great. There is a built in function to access the game though the video card software which helps integrate a number of game specific bug fixes. In effect they help support the trouble free gaming of the user by offering that level of support for the ones we have tried."

I bought this card with no intent on every playing games like Project Cars, Dirt 3, Batman Arkham City, FFXIV, and more at anything above low-medium setting. After all it was paired with a Skylake dual-core Pentium processor. Man, was I in for a surprise. While Project Cars and Ghost Recon Wildlands and Max settings at 60 FPS, it CAN run them at 60 FPS and low-mid settings. Older titles like Dirt 3, Batman Arkham series, Need For Speed Most Wanted, and FFXIV for example ran at max settings. Even the Just Cause 1&2 and Saints Row 2-4 all run smoothly at 50+ FPS. Recently got Watch_Dogs and that too ran smoothly, though not at max settings.

So who should get this card? Casual gamers who just want an inexpencive gaming PC instead of a console. ALso, PC gamers looking for a cheap card to game on while they wait for better ones to become affordable. I'm probably upgrading to a 1060 (or just the 1050 ti) this year and I would recomend if you can afford the 1050 ti, get that instead and will hold until you get your 1070s or 1080s."

The video card is great.,"Unfortunately this card still uses the venerable MSI Gaming APP for the overclock and LED light functions and it's always been a buggy mess. Constant crashing and locking up, and this has been on multiple PCs with various MSI graphics cards I have owned over the years. The card itself is great though. The overclocking settings in the ""APP"" isn't very much so you can run it stock without the software and still get great performance. The LED lighting though is another story. I've heard that Mystic Light will control the lighting but I'm not going to run another 3rd party program in the background just to have lights. The video card has only red lights anyway and my system is blue so I don't mind them not being on. Of course you can also use MSI Afterburner if you really feel like overclocking this card but it's not necessary. It runs very cool. The only time I have ever heard the fans come on is when I turned them on myself. After using a 750TI for several years this is a great upgrade for my old PC."

I had a similar problem with the MSI GTX 750 Ti low profile card. I took off the fans and found a label on the back.
The fans were made by idcooler.1688.com. The model is listed as XY-D05510S. I went to the website and found that it is all in Chinese. The fans are 50 mm diameter when measured across the blades, 12 volt, 0.28A 4000 rpm, with a 2 pin configuration. It would be nice if I could order replacement fans. But apparently other people are having the same issue. MSI needs to use better fans.

I have built a fan shroud out of .025"" thick aluminum sheet. HD sells it in 6""x18"".

I purchased 50 mm ball bearing fans from amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KRVPYLP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
they are smaller than the original fans. These measure 50mm at the outside of the housing. About 46 mm blade to blade. But the the rpm is listed at 7000.

I purchased a package of connectors from amazon as the connectors on the fans are too large.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07449V33P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The large holes in the aluminum were cut with a jewelers saw. Bending was accomplished with a bench vice, pliers, fingers, and a non marring mallet.

The connectors on the two fans were cut and soldered to a single 2 mm connector.
I had some small shrink tubing that I used to insulate the solder joints
The polarity of the connector had to be reversed as they are wired in opposite to the one on the original fans . A pin was used to lift the plastic tabs that holds the connectors in place and they were swapped red for black.
I have included some photos. Note the position of the fan wires. The red is positive. If you try this. Be sure to wire it correctly. I'm currently running this board and testing it out. I hope that it does well when the weather heats up.

At least now, if a fan dies, I can replace it quick."

It was quite difficult to install into my Acer Aspire ATC-705 desktop, however, and I will describe the process for anyone else who might have that or similar machine. The Aspire has one x16 slot, and one express slot. The cord to the optical drive comes out of the motherboard where the NVIDIA card must slide in place. After removing the side cover and prying the expansion covers loose, it is necessary to disconnect and remove the hard-drive from its bay. Any card in the express slot must also come out. Then the graphics card can be angled and rotated into position, with the optical wiring coming up between the two halves of the card. Then replace and reconnect the hard-drive. There is barely enough room, but it will fit."

First of all it barely has any noise while you work and then i tried a few modern games too (recent releases from last year) and it could easily handle them in 1080p resolution. Of course during the gaming sessions you'll hear the fan power up but still for the price you can't go wrong with it. I've been using a factory re-furbished one for 4 months now, it came in perfect shape, i don't think anyone used this, haven't found any scratches anywhere. I'm super satisfied with the purchase."

Also, it was shipped with a label slapped on the retail box. No other padding, protection, and not in another box. Also the box was NOT taped shut. I have no way to know if this is new or used since there was no factory seal on it. Even the anti-static bag it was in wasn't sealed.
Final issue: I guess the length seems to be different depending on where you measure from. I measured 7.2"" clearance and this was listed as 7.09"". I'm going to have to do a hardware modification to move my hard drive back to be able to close the lid on the computer as the hard drive rotates down in place and it won't quite clear the end of the card."

Make sure when you get a new GPU that it fits your system and has a strong enough power supply.

All that aside, great low end card for next gen gaming. It’s rendering capability in blender with cuda cores enabled is very useful.

This 1050Ti was perfect. Short, not extra power to connect, and will play most current games decently. It took me more time to get the cover back on my PC (bent pin slots) than to unpack and install. Three screws and lift out bracket with old card, insert new card and put it and bracket back.

I already had the 330w power brick so I wasn't too worried about power requirements on my x51 r2. First power up needed to remove old drivers and install new ones. Bingo, working like a charm.

Paid 165 USD after taxes. my CPU is causing my bottleneck but still able to play games and nearly maxed 1080p settings.
Games; Witcher 3(ultra, lowest 45fps),CS:GO(max 120 with a 1%low), GTAV(auto:very high 55fps+). I haven't seen a decrease in performance since I have installed.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANY BUDGET or UPGRADE!!!

UPDATED: 3/22/2018
PC Specs; Intel Core i5-8600k, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, ASUS Prime z370-z Mobo and same GPU.
This graphics card is insanely good, plenty of head room for those wanting to manually overclocking or those who just want plug in and play. I personally I have seen the fans start to turn at ~63C (23% fan speed, not even audible) .I have yet to see this GPU get past 65C. Core Voltage can NOT be edited, it'll show it in the MSI Afterburner APP but soon as a game is launched it'll drop it to zero (something related to MSI not allowing it trying to help keep their customers from experiencing motherboard dangers).
GamersNexus showed that Core clock of 150, Memory Clock of 500 is the only OverClock that is 100% stable and reliable, of which I personally found before reading the article.
This GPU crush's DOOM at 1080p ultra! GTAV at max settings (using GamersNexus settings) at a stable 35fps but could easily achieve a locked 60+fps with default in settings. CSGO at locked 200+ fps. Overwatch ultra but scaling at 100% locked 55FPS. For the 156USDD it was well worth the buy but NOT worth the current prices due to the crazy price fluctuations from miners and supply/demand.
I would only replace this card if it died (currently using the stable OverCLock for 14 monthsnow) on me, I don't plan on playing at 2k/1440p, this card is BEST for those wanting 1080p but don't mind medium settings."

I have been using a 2011(?) laptop with an i7 2630QM Nvidia GT 550m since 2016 and before that a 2009 craptop since 2011.... Not anymore. 2017 is the year I finally upgrade to a real gaming rig, and the year I build my first PC.

From a noobie (rookie) point of view, this is a freakin' amazing upgrade! I bought the MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GAMING X 4G and am very satisfied with the results it gives. If you are in somewhat in the same position as me, then you won't be disappointed with this card as an upgrade. Having the settings at 1080p on high and ultra settings, as well as having filters and effects enabled is a very, very good satisfying experience.

The product came well packaged and there were no issues, problems or damages on the box or on the card, it will be safe during transit, don't worry if you were.

It is an amazing card and I recommend it, that is if you can get one at the original price and not at scalper (reseller's marked up) prices. During this review, July 16th 2017, the scalper price is $200, so good luck. Go with another 1050 ti card if you have to and do not want to wait, I was lucky to get mine just before the prices went bonkers.

Well, good luck and have fun, guys."

1) The card is pretty long! Make sure you have room in your tower! I suggest if you don't then move your HDD or SSD to another location.

2) This fan requires PCIE power connection! My previous card was a GT 510 Nvidia, so didn't require power. This card does and the MSI logo lights up. I'm was new to builds, so if you need PCIE power there are cords on Amazon.

3) Card fans may not be spinning! This is okay was the card fans only start spinning when needed to! This helps to reduce noise and power consumption.

Overwatch- i can get an easy 60fps on high on 900p and a stuttery 60fps on high 1080p.
WWE 2K19 (released 10/5/19)- so this is the newest game ive got and this i play on on 720p high and full crowd capacity and get max frames with no drops. I know past wwe games have had awful ports for frame rates so i bought this as a gamble and was pleasantly surprised.
PUBG- I run on 900p again but can get anywhere from 45fps - 60 usually. And 45 being the lowest usually.
Monster Hunter World - i switch between 900p and 720p on this one. This ones kinda weird when im streaming i play on 720p medium just so i can stay as close to 60fps as i can. But when im not streaming if i remember ill usually play on 900p medium-ish settings and and about 60fps as well.

Hopefully this helped someone, im not usually a reviewer lol :) but i definitely reccomend this card for ur pc build if ur comparing, i compared between a few cards before buying this one as well."

I originally bought a 2 year old computer from a bank it came without a graphics card so I had to start searching for one. I checked over every card in the 100-200 dollar price range and this is the one that stood out to me the most. It arrived 2 days after I bought it and installation was a breeze. After about an hour o installing software and drivers it ran like a champ. The only 2 games I’ve tested it on are war thunder and world of warships but on both it ran around 80 FPS with no drops on max settings. This is the first graphics card I’ve ever owned and installed. It was also able to run without problems on a 240 W power supply. If your look for a cheap graphics card that will run any game you through at it and your on a budget this is the best card for anywhere near 200 dollars.

For those games (running in 1920x1024) this card is amazing. If you are a fan of the ""Homeworld"" series games, you can crank everything up and the space battles look epic!

I use it with a Pentium G4560 CPU. I play all my older AAA games at 60fps at ultra/high settings (Skyrim is 60fps on ultra settings). Ultra settings will drop to 50fps in demanding situations for brand new AAA games like farcry 5 and even 40 - 45fps at times, but lowering to medium/high will give solid 60fps.

If you plan to play 4K games you are going to have to lower the settings to medium for solid 60fps, ultra/high will be more of a 30fps gameplay. In my opinion you should grab a better GPU if you want 4K gaming with high/ultra settings."

Runs Path of Exile at 1080p 80 FPS silently. Noticed that the fans do ram up when the framerate goes beyond 140. Outside of running games the card is very quiet. Love the lights on this.

While the card could get fairly toasty, but I just adjusted my fan curve to max out at 65% fan speed, which did not produce as much noise as I expected. The card could easily reach 80°C on stock settings, but a bit of fan tweaking fixes the issue. I also appreciate the mostly black and grey color scheme with a single RGB Gigabyte logo; really helps with customization. So far, I have zero complaints. 100% recommend this card, although be sure you purchase the Rev 2.0 version."

 Adquiri esta tarjeta ya que buscaba algo de potencia para el 1080p sin gastar mucho estaba decidido por una RTX o una GTX pero están sumamente inflados los precios en mi país estas tarjetas así que me decidí investigar y probando una RTX 2060 de un amigo, la RX 5600XT me resulta mas potente, la diferencia entre la 2060 y esta es que la 2060 tiene ray traicing y el codec nvenc para streaming pero si eres como yo que no te interesa el ray traicing y no haces streaming esta esta perfecta para ti.

Cabe decir que esta versión es la que tiene la BIOS ya actualizada que hace que libere todo su potencial así que ya no tendrás que hacer nada mas que instalarla y listo, funciona de maravilla

la temperatura que tengo es de 35 a 37 en reposo teniendo 2 monitores conectados y 1 televisor, viendo películas o vídeo la temperatura es igual, en juegos la he probado con juegos como Red dead redemtion 2 y la temperatura no sube a mas de 64 grados en settings altos con una tasa de 50 a 65 fps y en GTAV no pasa de 60 grados en ultras con una tasa de 60 a 80 fps, los fps se limitan por mi procesador el cual le hace cuello de botella a mi tarjeta pero lo actualizare en breve.

That's where the positives end. Compared to the RX 580 (at $185) this card is a rip-off in the FPS/$$$ department. Team Red's 580 matches the performance of the 1660, yet it costs $35 LESS. For the cost-difference in comparable GPUs, the GDDR5 1660 is a waste of your money. After owning both the 1660 and the 1660 Ti, paired with a 9400F, I can say for certain, that if you MUST HAVE NVIDIA, get the Ti. For the $60 higher cost, you get about 30% higher performance AND it can even play games on high setting at 4K very comfortably. IF YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT NVIDIA, go with the RX 580 at this performance margin and save $35 for the SAME PERFORMANCE.

This gave me a reason to upgrade, and I found 1060 to be the current best ""bang-for-the-buck"". I just wish the video card market was better now (I really don't like cryptominers).

This is the first time I purchased a card from with the ZOTAC brand. Once I chose the 1060, I based the purchase of this brand on the price and size of the card. I'm very happy with it. It works perfect with DP connections to dual 1440p monitors. I noticed that both monitors now show up as audio devices too, and it works, but the monitor audio is not very good, which is to be expected. I think I'll stick to my external DAC/AMP with headphones, but I thought that was cool.

The fan is quiet when not under load, but does get louder, but not super loud, when under extreme load. The only thing left to do is test how long it lasts. I'll update this review if I have any issues."

Against my better judgement, I’d tried a Radeon-based card beforehand and it was an incompatible nightmare.

There are cheaper cards out there, but the ZOTAK had the GPU I wanted and a lot more RAM than some of the other options.

Installation was overall pretty simple. Pull the old card, drop in the new one and hook up the PCIE power cable. I highly recommend that you use at least a 650 or 750 watt supply. I had a Corsair 750 watt supply on my parts shelf that I installed at the same time and when I fired the system up, I was impressed that I didn’t hear a lot of fan noise.

I like to use the official Nvidia drivers since they usually have better management utilities and better performance. After setting the system to use the “multi-user.target”, I followed their installation procedure to blacklist the nouveau kernel modules and installed their drivers.

After rebooting, the system went back to the default “graphical.target” and things just worked from there on.

I did some testing with Kerbel on Steam and the display was crisp, clean and had a decent frame rate. I didn’t notice any extra fan noise and verified that the card continued to run cool. The two large fans do a nice job moving air while making minimal noise.

Overall, I’m pretty impressed with the card. It gives a reasonable balance between price and performance and has been trouble free so far.."

I was originally shopping for a 1050/1050Ti but when I finally got around to buying one I decided to go with the 1060 and just pay an extra 50 bucks. It was VERY worth it. The performance on the 1060 (not event he Ti) really just doesn't even compare to even the 1050Ti and its only a bit more expensive. Like all PC gamers I'm still fuming over the prices of GPUs due to (it almost makes me vomit trying to say it) ""Miners"" so that is a MAJOR downside because no one should have to pay this much for a video card these days. Anyways most things about this card are good so I'm not going to list them all but the main ones is that it was easy to install and get into my PC and I've had no issues with it since my first use about 6 months ago now. Some downsides is that it runs hot so just be careful with that and the 3GB model is somewhat lacking on performance. So if you're looking for a bit better performance when running games I would grab the 6GB model or the Ti (they might be the same idk). Defiantly get this instead if you're looking at a 1050 because I would still consider this a 'budget' card but it just runs way better than a 1050 ever did. BUT if you wan't serious performance it's not even a competition the 1070/Ti/1080/Ti are WAYYYY better especially if you're looking into streaming. Zotac makes them very well and I'm very happy with it but I have to say EVGA is probably the better manufacturer as they don't run quite as hot."

This is an amazing GPU. I never used ZONTAC before, always bought MSI for my products on my PC. But I had to replace a 1060 that lasted 3 years (founders) and for the pricing this seemed like a perfect fit, while slightly upgrading my system for a tight budged. I must admit, compared to my MSI founders 1060GTX this is a lot noisier, but not by much. Since its a smaller form factor that my HUGE 1060 (which had 2 fans), this one is considerable smaller (half the size) and only 1 fan, so it has to work a little harder to cool of the card.

Besides that, installation was basic, plug and play basically. Download the nvidia drivers and you are good to go. I play mostly MMOs, like Black Desert Online, Tera, GW2, and I run all at max graphics. Also aRPG like Pathfinder: Kingmaker, D:OS2, and Pillars of Eternity 2. Also at max graphics. Again this is no 1080 or 2080 card, this will run perfect at 30 fps to 45 fps most high demanding games, but try to push it and it will stagger. Keep in mind a good amount of RAM is needed for many games; so if you are having problems it may be because of RAM available on your system.

enjoy!"

I'm posting this review to give people a heads up. It's a much cooler running card and it is mostly silent. The installation requires an 8pin while my first card was 6. Fortunately Dell has an innovative little attachment that lets you add 2 more.

It was the Nvida software that held me up. Not being a fan of that 'Experience' I just wanted the drivers and after downloading the game ready drivers it kept telling me it couldn't install in my version of windows10. Which was a first for me. Ultimately I was able to install the 'studio' drivers by installing on a peripheral drive. The card itself can now play games like Red Dead Redemption at Ultimate settings without a hitch. For around $200 as a gaming card it seems like a solid purchase and something to hold you over for a couple of tech cycles."

Not dissapointed at all. It's fairly quick for 60fps games and pairs wonderfully with the i5-9400f and Ryzen 2600x systems I've built recently for family. To be honest you can get a used 1070 for roughly the same price (or possibly even cheaper) and the 1070 will give better performance and more ram, but if you want a warrenty and piece of mind of a newer video card, I highly suggest this.

For streamers, I can't say enough about how awesome the new turing NVENC is. I used to use my 5960x on X264 Medium for a 1080/60fps 6000bit rate stream. Those settings normally hit the pc at about 60% usage. Now on High Quality NVENC (version2) at 6000 bit rate at 1080/60fps, my cpu usage is always sub 3%. Even though I don't game on the 5960x, I've found the nvenc streaming literally perfect. People have said my stream quality is top notch. I can't suggest it enough to those interested."

The card was resetting constantly, turning my gaming PC into a very expensive paperweight. Calling ZOTAC customer service was a joke, as I got no where fast. Never again will I buy a ZOTAC product, and I would recommend EVERYONE look elsewhere.

Portal 2 hits a consistent 144hz and never drops below. Insurgency: Sandstorm will drop to at the lowest 40fps. Grand Theft Auto 5 is 45-75FPS on high.
If you aren't looking to MAX out every game this definitely isn't a card you're looking for anyway. But for a budget gaming pc. This card is amazing. Also runs NVIDIA's special graphic setting hoopla excellently.

Update: This GPU also overclocks pretty nicely with good temps. I'm currently pushing a +275mhz core clock with a +980mhz memory clock. Noticeable increase in frame rates and stays below 75c"

I chose the mini 3gb version as I wanted a small form card for my mini-itx build, and didn't see the value in the 6gb model. Even under load, this card performs very well and doesn't get too loud or hot. Even with the single fan, it seems to do a good job at thermals.

A very good investment. One or two years old games like Fallout 4 automatically run on Ultra settings at 1080p resolution. Enough to say that it provides smooth gaming. The mini version is convenient for me as I have a small gamer case. It's quiet and compatible with old MOBO's. The reason I give one star less is that I have some game freeze issues lately and I had once a 'blue screen' too. I guess it is due to the NVIDIA driver and Windows 10 OS compatibility. I have 5 fans installed in my case so I don't think overheating is the problem. I suspect the NVIDIA driver. It also takes like 10 minutes to start up my Windows 10 because ""NVIDIA driver is not responding"" after 10 minutes it catches up and loads the OS.

5/5 for me. Drivers were easy to install, fans are quiet and I am more than happy with performance.
Was going back and forth between wanting the 1660 and rx 580 but I'm glad I spent the extra money. I would say spend a little more for the Super or Ti if you are playing at higher resolutions but for 1080p this will max out anything with no issues."

It likely deserves the overall good reviews that it gets here, and I hope that it lasts a long time, as my last two Geforce cards (of another manufacture).

Unfortunately I strongly disliked my experience of the MSI website and account creation process, and simply would rather not deal with this company again. Product registration is not required for warranty fulfillment (that's the law in this country) but if you do later need them to honor the warranty it isn't unreasonable for them to require a verification process anyway, so I went ahead and attempted registration.

It is not unusual for today's websites to include so very many scripts and cookies, but I do not approve of a corporate site that I need to trust to abuse this process so very much for purpose of marketing interests and intrusive data collection being placed above respect of the customer. In spite of this I went ahead with several steps of the process until I had more than enough. I wanted an account only to facilitate product registration, not to lead me through surveys and the rest.

My hope is that the card will perform for me for at least the warranty period so that I don't have to deal with them, which is a shame since they apparently make some competitive products."

I was somewhat concerned regarding bus speed: my PC only has PCI-express version 2 - versus the newer, faster version 3 - but the card works well. I use it for gaming and light video go-pro editing and have seen a significant improvement over the ATI radeon 4800 series card it replaced.

I ordered this card around December 2019. I experienced issues with my computer freezing after running for a random amount of time between 10 minutes and 6 days. The freezing happened in both Windows and Linux, which is indicative of a hardware problem. After RMAing my motherboard, processor, and memory, and still facing the freezing issue, I RMA'd this video card in May 2020. Before shipping it to MSI, I purchased a low performance, temporary video card so that I could continue to use my computer for work during the RMA process. My computer has not frozen once since installing the new video card.

I repacked the video card in the OEM box with all original materials, and packed that box in the shipping box with air-filled packing material. Today, I received the card back from MSI with no packing material, leaving the box to bang around inside the shipping box. The video card was also returned in an unmarked white box with none of my OEM materials. MSI has informed me that I will not be receiving the original box back, which would have been nice to know before shipping them the card. MSI is also unable to tell me the nature of the work performed on my card, if any work was performed on my card, or whether diagnostic testing revealed any issues.

After this experience with MSI customer service, I am not interested in buying any MSI products in the future, and would like to simply return the card for a refund. MSI claims that they do not issue refunds."

I used to run my fans on high and now I can run them on low and my room doesn't get warm at all. Can run GTA V, R6, Overwatch, Halo, CoD, and most other games perfectly fine on mid-level settings (I have a 1080p 60Hz display) and any less-intensive game on max settings.

With that said, I am surprised at the performance this puts out, and this card has a trick up its sleeve: it overclocks really well!

Using MSI afterburner software I was able to get the boost clock speed up to 2050 Mhz and the memory speed up to 4600Mhz... that's a pretty solid performance boost. I downloaded Jedi: Fallen Order on Steam and when I saw the graphics and how well it looks and how smooth it ran on my computer I literally said ""WOW!"" Fallen Order is on very high settings and at 2560 x 1440 resolution.

MSI did a great job of setting this card for overclocking, even with my extreme overclock, I have not seen this card go above 75 celsius. Thank you MSI!

I am running a 9900K processor, 32GB of 3200Mhz RAM and my monitor supports 144 refresh rate and G-Sync.

The impact of a high refresh rate monitor cannot be overstated though, I highly recommend using one."

It work pretty great for VR too. It's not the smootest with really pretty VR games but it works fine. I played phasmophobia on VR yesterday with it and it was butter smooth depends on the game. Not sure it could be the best with something like Half Life Alyx with high graphic settings."

1525,15.0,PowerColor Red Devil AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT 8GB AXRX 5700XT 8GBD6-3DHE/OC,PowerColor,AMD,8,1770 MHz,$185.40,4.4 out of 5 stars,There is good reason why everyone wants one of these cards. 11/10 Best purchase I ever made!,"The first thing I want to mention is the look of this card. It is absolutely stunning! Something you need to keep in mind is the fact that, in online pictures and videos, the card looks like it has a dark and light grey colour scheme. However, in person, it actually has a black and dark grey colour scheme. In my opinion, pictures and videos of this card simply don't do it justice. It is a stunning and stealthy card that has quite the presence about it. If you are concerned that this card has a 'plastic' look to it, don't worry, in person it looks more like metal and immediately gives you the impression of quality. The RGB is a great touch and brings a lot of extra style to this card. The LED's are a very nice brightness and their colour accuracy is spot on. One thing I will make note of are the RGB animations. Some of these animations are not quite as smooth as they could be, however, I think this might be a software issue and will possibly get smoother out in the future.

Performance is phenomenal! I can throw any triple-A title at it and it remains cool and virtually silent, all the while cranking out frames like nobody's business. I won't say too much more about performance as you can find many tech YouTubers who will give you all the stats and graphs you will need. I will say, however, that coming from a laptop that would practically have a stroke if I opened anything beyond MS Paint, the 5700 XT Red Devil is an amazing experience and has been well worth every cent.

I also want to make a quick note of PowerColor. You see, because of the high demand for these cards, as well as other circumstances, PowerColor was not able to keep up with all of the orders being place (particularly in the US). So, like many others, I had to wait over a month to get my card. However, during this time I came in contact with three PowerColor representatives (one on Twitter, one on Reddit, and one via email), and they were all fantastic with keeping myself and the whole community (especially those on Reddit) up to date and informed about the situation. I'm going to be honest here, I had several opportunities to order a few different 5700 XT's and have them at my front door within a couple of days, all the while I waited for the Red Devil with no word. But it was because of the openness, honesty, and sincerity of PowerColor and its representatives that I stuck with my order and waited it out. One thing is for sure, PowerColor has made me a very loyal customer."

 Finally received mine last week and I was impressed by how fast this thing runs. I am very pleased that this ran close to the msi gtx2080 trio I sent back to Newegg, which btw I would tell others to avoid like a plague due to terrible customer service.

This card runs cool and ran smoothly with the updated drivers that so far I have not encountered any hicups.

The card is huge so be sure your case can accommodate this, but the plus side is that you don't have to worry about the card sagging.

Overall I am satisfied with this card because it offers the best bang for the buck. You wont go wrong with this.

Edit. Have this for a year now and i encountered the black screen glitch when playing video games.

Had to reinstall the drivers, reboot the computer then updates and now runs great"

- Phenomenal performance. I was shocked when I launched my games, switched to 4K, and remained at the same 60FPS. I can't play every game at 4K, but I can a lot more than before.
- It looks so NICE. The RGB illuminates a soft light. The backplate is all BLACK. Fantastic design.
- Lights on the ports. This is the future.
- Almost absolutely silent. I hear my CPU fan over it. The most it has gotten to is 50% fan speed, and that was nothing. It sounds like it should be idling at 50%.
- Stays very cool.
- No crashing, blue-screens, or any technical problems so far.

Cons:
- It's pretty big. I had to remove my two front fans to get it into my case which was a big hassle.
- The RGB software is a bit disappointing. The only one worth using is the solid color.
- The ""Red Devil"" text is upside down on the port side.

Other thoughts:
All of the RX 5700 XTs have similar performance. What you should look for then is the temperatures and noise. According to the benchmarks, the Red Devil has one of the best temperatures and noise. The only real rival is the Sapphire Nitro+. I chose this over the Nitro+ because of the design. The Nitro+ is covered in a lame white while this is all black. Plus, this is actually for sale, so.... I'm pretty happy with it."

Latest driver is horrendous, so backtracked 3. but any OC or even normal stock settings the card crashed and hardlocked into a black screen. I was so excited to get it cause its the 2nd best next to the strix model. Im sorry powercolor but this experience is making me go team green sadly."

This card is a monster literally it will crush every game you throw at it, I haven't tested the card to it's full potential but I've been playing Assassins Creed Syndicate, World War Z, Fortnite and Watch Dogs in 1080p 60ghz everything ultra details witch is like a walk in the park for this card, always pushing past 100 fps.

I installed my last drivers and I had no problems, the only thing I can say about this card is that it is powerful man. I upgraded from a RX 580 8GB and I can feel the difference.

Physically this card is so big and it looks aggressive, I feel like if I throw it at somebody I might cause serious injuries you can use this thing as a weapon. It has RGB lights and those are bright, look really nice. The backplate is awesome it has a bull craved on it and it lights up, also the back ports are lit in red. There is a software Powercolor devilzone that let's you configure the lightning of the card, you can configure the lights to do all sorts of things like pulse, flash, blink but the coolest in my opinion is smart, this lightning mode varies it's intensity depending on the load or temperature of your CPU or GPU. You get 1 hdmi port and 3 DP.

This card has a switch that let's you configure the card in two modes: overclocking and silent, of course I have mine in overclocking.

Also the card makes no noise and it runs cool the most hot it gets is 70c under load.

I'll continue to update this review as time passes and I have the chance to push this bad boy to it's limit to see how much performance I can get out of it. I'll buy a 1440p monitor soon and then I'll be able to test 1440p resolution and see if I can play everything on ultra and keep at least 60 fps.

Amazing card, I play resident evil 3 this is 2020 game and the graphics are something like you've never seen before in 1080p 60fps everything in ultra this games pushes the card to 100% 😧 this game is really demanding and it looks like a movie, I think this is the most demanding game I've ever played AAA Game.

I also play Detroit become human everything ultra, graphics on this game are incredible.

I dont think there is a game I can't play on ultra 1080 60fps. If a games comes out that I can't play I'll let you know but until 2023 or 2024 maybe there will be one.

If I could buy the ryzen 9 3900x CPU that I want I would have a monster PC, I thing I have a bottleneck on my CPU but I can't afford the ryzen 9 beast."

I read AMD Cards are finicky with the drivers. First time I tried to install it I removed all my old Nvidia drivers with DDU then put this card in and installed the most recent AMD drivers right off the site and my screen went dark tried playing around with bios settings etc could get the screen to come back up. I removed the card and AMD drivers with DDU and put my old Nvidia card back in and reinstalled those drivers everything was fine again. Was going to return this but gave it one more shot did a complete clean of my windows boot SSD and ran DDU to remove anything left again by Nvidia then put the card back in this time I ran the installer directly from the AMD software on the disc included in the packaging then updated the drivers/software after that and so far it seems to be stable for now. Card does look beautiful. It is massive though so make sure you have a large case. I also dropped it down an additional star because it said it comes with a game either BL3 or new Ghost Recon and I should get a code by email if you ordered it through Amazon.com seller. Never got the code and now in my order details it’s not showing up there that I should be receiving that “gift” anywhere. Pretty shady. I’ve ordered cards through other sites for other builds and had no problems with that before and got the code within a day of purchase. I’ll update ta star again if that gets worked out but not holding my breath.

Update 10/22/19: I updated it 1 Star I got the game code and am impressed by the card. I like it better than the 2060 super thus far."

This card offers exceptional cooling and acoustics. Even in the performance BIOS mode, it is not audible to me when at full load. The performance is outstanding for the price. Upgrading from a Vega 64, there is a noticeable increase in FPS. I game at 2560x1080 and I hope to upgrade to 1440p soon. This card will easily handle the increased resolution. Features such as Radeon Image Sharpening and Freesync work great when enabled. I've had no issues with AMD's drivers as some reviewers have stated. I have not experienced any crashes. Because Navi is being used in the next gen consoles, I am looking forward to seeing how developers will leverage the architecture's underlying features. I am hopeful this generation will age like the fine wine of AMD's past.

One thing to note, this card is massive. If you have a small case you may find fitment difficult. If I could change one thing about this card, I would have utilized a PCB cutout for the PCIe 8-pin power connectors. Not that this will be a problem for many, but I feel it is a little more elegant to have the connectors recessed."

The card is beautiful! No problems get it going at all. It's quiet and I have it on my desk, about 2-3 feet away from me. I replaced my old R9 390 Gaming from Gigabyte which was phenomenal for about 3 years and I wanted to try something new. The first game I wanted to try was GTA V and Watchdogs. With all settings Maxed on both of course. I felt I gained about 20 or so FPS on both games, nothing earth shattering, but I was expecting more. But maybe my system is creating a bottleneck somewhere I don't know.
I tried to do a benchmark and it failed every time with an error that no 3d device was found or something like that. I spent most of the weekend researching, but nothing seemed logical. At first Watchdogs wouldn't run at all and that took hours of research as well, as most posts are from 4 years ago or so. I contacted Uplay and they told me to do the usual stuff, check for drivers, .net stuff, etc. Nothing worked.
I then contacted Power Color and it took 2 days to get a response. I got a one sentence response from what seemed like a human being and the rest of the email was a generic tank response about trying different things. Yes, even checking into my power supply to make sure it is on the list. And yes, even do a fresh install of Windows 10. I replied back that their instructions were ridiculous and I got a response right away to call a phone number.
Then I just happen to get an email from AMD today about the new driver that came out today. I did a clean install of the driver and boom, Watchdogs started working. I haven't done a benchmark yet to see if I get an error, but my advice is if you have issues, wait for AMD drivers as they are coming faster and more frequent.
I would give this card a 4th star, but like I said so far I am getting about 20 or so more frames than with my old card that is 3 years old, 4 if you count release date. If I were to get maybe 35+ FPS, I would give it a 5 star review despite my initial issue, which frankly I expected bumps on the road considering how new this card is.

1533,15.0,PowerColor Red Devil AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT 8GB AXRX 5700XT 8GBD6-3DHE/OC,PowerColor,AMD,8,1770 MHz,$185.40,4.4 out of 5 stars,Straight to the point review - 5700XT Red Devil,"First off, this card performs very well - its the AMD drivers you need to keep an eye out for. I bought this card to test out due to curiosity. I was using a EVGA 2070 Super.

Noise - Very little noise. Zero coil squeal. Obviously, if you overclock the card, the fans will produce slightly higher amounts of noise. I game with headphones, so this is not a problem.

Performance - Excellent. This card is powerful enough to run all my primary games at high or ultra settings. I tested on AC:ODY, Doom Eternal, Far Cry 5 & RDR2

Thermals - I tested this card for 7 hours straight, and the temperature never got over 62 degrees Celsius. That is phenomenal.

RGB - Plenty options to choose from, all look great.

Bottom Line: I am not disappointed in this card. I think that if you are a true AMD fan, this card will satisfy your gaming needs. Coming from Nvidia, I was pleasantly surprised to see that AMD has finally released a stable version of their drivers and this card performed very well. The only negative I can think of is the size of it. this card is massive, and you should ensure that your case can fit it properly.

Setup:
1) Case: Corsai 220T
2) CPU: Ryzen 3700X
3) Mobo: Asus 570X Elite"

Powercolor went above and beyond for cooling with the triple fan and ginormous heat sink. The backplate is solid and does not flex. There are multiple RGB zones that you can set with Power Colors software, I personally stick with a rainbow wave to match my system. Something to note is that the card is long and heavy. If you have a smaller case (especially a pre-built), measure your space to ensure it will fit. It is a two slot card, and although for me it is well balanced, it could sag in cheaper cases due to it's size.

This card is currently paired with a Ryzen R5 1600, (OC to 3.9 ghz), 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. I've tested a variety of games, and this card is able to max out everything I've given it at 1080p, at 75fps. This includes, Witcher 3, Borderlands 3, GTA V, Overwatch, League of Legends, Diablo 3, and Cities Skylines. From a benchmarking perspective, it is a nearly 100% increase in performance from my previous RX 480.

Edit: Card has crashed with black screens nearly daily since I have purchased the card. Have worked with support from both AMD and Powercolor and no amount of driver uninstallation and reinstallations will fix it. The performance is incredible when it works, but that is few and far between. Would not recommend buying the card."

Got here in a timely fashion, and was packaged extremely well. But the card it itself is absolute garbage. When it works its very nice and I understand the amd drivers are not great, but this piece of crap does nothing but black screen. I can't stress this enough. Do not buy this card if you want any semblance of extended game play. Doesnt matter the game...COD, Borderlands 3, Fortnite, Far Cry 5. Any game I have will black screen in the middle of gaming at random times. No matter what resolution I have it on, or what hz i have my monitor set to. Black Sceens galore. I have wiped my entire computer and re-downloaded the necessities and only amd drivers, I have tried every possible thing. I even got a new 750w psu at the same time. I have watched every youtube video possible and have tried every fix.. Nothing helps. DO NOT BUY THIS CARD. save yourself the hassle. I really want to like amd, which is the reason for the purchase. But as it stands right now, I'll probably never buy another AMD card again. Powercolor is probably a great company and its sad that I have to give this review based on AMD. Buy a 1070 Super."

I researched graphics cards for a while before deciding to go with this card. Graphics cards are so expensive, and I aas concerned I would be disappointed going away from NVidia and I read many reviews on these cards where people had issues with the drivers, and games were crashing. Its always hard to tell when reading a review if the product is at fault or the user is doing something wrong. This graphics card is huge compared to my last one but it did squeeze into my case. Installation of the drivers went smoothly. I installed the drivers that came with the card and then immediately did an update. I did the express installation and set my card to game mode in the AMD driver software. I have played a lot of games with this card for long hours and I have not had one issue with games crashing. I am usually maxing out my frames per second at 144 which is the max my monitor will do. Some games are slightly under 144, but I have my settings mostly maxed out so if I really cared I could lower my settings and probably max out my frames. I have been monitoring temps and they are right where you would expect under extreme load and at idle. On top of being a good performer the card looks nice and is great quality. I recommend this card to anyone who likes to game as much as I do and cannot afford the NVidia 2089ti."

 I knew this would be a big GPU but seeing it in person it’s no joke! It looks awesome! It so big that I cannot Vertically mount it in my rig due to touching my RAM.

I read all the horror stories of the driver issues and it’s only been one day so too soon to tell but no problems yet. I don’t feel I need to overclock this bad boy just yet. It’s fast enough for me. I hear I need to undervolt the gpu for better stability but I’ll worry about that if I run into any issues.

Build quality is great and card looks really nice, but I've had nothing but issues since putting it into my pc.

There always seems to be some type of hoop to jump through to get this card running right. Especially if you have multiple monitors. For the first month my second monitor would just blank out randomly. Would have to stand up and unplug/plug in the monitor and all would go back to normal until the next random black screen. This month (had the gpu for 2 months now) when I turn my computer on the resolution on my main monitor (34 inch ultrawide) would go right dead to the middle of the screen while the second monitor is fine. Nothing fixes this except for swapping the main monitor from displayport to hmdi for about 5-10 mins and then switching the cords back. No idea why this keeps happening other than bad drivers that AMD is too busy ignoring so they can get the next gen gpu's out.

I wish I had gone with Nvidia instead. Nothing will ever be perfect but maybe I wouldn't have to spend every morning switching video cables around.

Too late to send it back to Amazon, now just trying to get a refund from PowerColor.

Probably best to stay away. It's been out for almost a year and they still can't get the software right."

I also tried installing the card into another PC and had the same issue, it's clearly dead on arrival. I'm waiting to hear back from Powercooler for warranty. For now, I'm out $439."

For those of you familiar, AMD has suffered Black Screen issues with their RX 5700 XT line. I had heard the issue had improved so I took a shot with it. No luck.

Support was of no help. I offered to run any diagnostic tool they had (as I'm a techie) to help them troubleshoot the issue. The best I got from support was to RMA the card and get a new one. Gee, thanks.

I flat out told the tech if I was yanking it out of my system and getting a new card, I'd be putting a nVidia card in my system...and that's exactly what I did (2080S).

My advice is to check to see if AMD has finally fixed their black screen issues before buying this card.

NOTE: I'm a huge fan of AMD. I have a 3970x ThreadRipper in my system. So I was very disappointed that this card would not work in my brand new system as well as the poor technical support I received."

Outperforms my expectations most of the time. Had black screens in some games when I first got it 3-4 months ago but those issues are gone. Can stutter a bit in some games at first but with a little settings and fan curve tuning it's easily fixable. Those issues are 5700xt related though.
better job on the driver end making the card plug and play but it is steadily getting better, the ""fine wine"" that you'll sometimes see people refer to Radeon drivers as.

Edit- had this card for almost 7 months before I finally got rid of it. Stuttering became a non stop issue in almost every game. Crashes to desktop at the worst possible times like when others needed me to do something. Temporary black screens. It really became embarrassing when playing with friends. When you're the only person in a Discord chat with a Radeon card and it's become a joke with everyone how often it screws up. Even games that did run fine would suddenly screw up with the next driver release but, you need the new drivers because there's always something wrong. I became heavily involved with a Reddit community on AMD's own subreddit trying to figure out what was causing it. There were a lot of us and AMD didn't even acknowledge the issue for months. I eventually had enough, bought a 2070 Super and that card hasn't given me a single issue.

I really couldn't recommend any of these 5700xts to anyone. Some people have limited issues with the card but, you're really rolling the dice. I hear that AMD says it's been fixed but, I still see people complaining with the same issues. The sale is 20$ off of a card that will be replaced in days anyway."

I haven't purchased Radeon for over a decade and the last one I did also had driver issues.

Fantastic GPU, comes out of the box as overclocked so you get the biggest performance you want. Pair this GPU with a high refresh monitor and you will love everything from it.

1440p is definitely the max it can do with great frames, you can probably push it more but I don't have a 4k monitor. All my settings are maxed on every game so that's awesome, I came from an RX 480 because it ended up dying on me lol.

Just as an FYI the power limit while it is on OC'ed mode is 225W so if it hits that it tends to crash (trying to see if there is a way to pass it without crashing, will update if I find a solution) but clock speeds hit 2100 Mhz or so. But if you crash often just turn off your computer and switch it to ""Silent"" mode, it just puts the normal clock speeds in with the boost clock being over 1900 Mhz. Also this is at 1440p, if you run 1080p just keep it OC'ed you should be fine.

Update (for OC mode crashing) (12/18/2020) : for some reason the fans didn't ramp up out of the box so it overheated... So I did a manual ramp up and the Temps are still in the high 70s under full load but that seems to be normal. Oh and power limit is not 225W its much higher, like around 300W. You can double check at Power Color site.

I highly recommend this card, it's fantastic for mid to high end gaming for sub $500 (at time I purchased was around $420 or so). Just make sure you have a high refresh monitor at 1080p or 1440p! You won't regret it!

P. S. : They are running a promo for Godfall and World of Warcraft: Shadowlands at time of review/purchase. It stops by end of year (or so).

Update (12/18/2020): tried doing streaming on Twitch but some reason I crash too often and it seems like it can't handle a game and streaming at the same time. Will update if I find a solution."

They did an amazing job making this card and they deserve to have good business. BUT...

AMD drivers really are still horrible as of February 15th, 2020. I didn’t want to believe it and I really had my heart set on this card so I thought I would chance it. Well low and behold just like half the people who own it say- the drivers simply do not work. The first thing I did once I installed it was load up rainbow six. I would get into the main screen and it would crash within around 20 seconds or so at least 90% of the time. About 1/10 times I tried it would actually work but most of the time it would not. I couldn’t even load the division 2 either. The hardware and value of this card are amazing and very attractive indeed, but if you literally can’t even run your games because the software engineers at AMD have a 11th grade level computer science education then it sadly is a waste of money."

It’ll run any current game above 60fps on the highest settings at 1440p. Be sure to delete any Nvidia drivers if you have them and download the most current AMD drivers and you’ll be fine. My card was super loud at first and I was bummed out but a simple fan curve tweak made it sound a lot better and it’s the same temps or slightly lower. Keep in mind this card runs in the mid 70c range maybe in the 80’s which is no big deal. This card can run 110c before it thermal throttles. Coming from the old 1060 if I saw anything above 75c I’d shut it down, this puppy keeps kicking away. It is a big card but I fit it just fine in a Corsair 460x case with room to spare. Also I did get the free games with it within two business days as stated by amazon, so not sure why other people didn’t get them. I was going to go for a 2070 super but at $100 or more it’s not worth it. A couple more driver updates and I’m sure this card will dust the ol Nvidia camp."

I am learning like a noob geek with these new cards, and one thing I learned is that junction temperature is perfectly OK at 82°C, which I considered to be abnormally hot and that is why I returned it, along with the fact that my games were suffering of micro stuttering, so bad the frame rates were being affected badly; bad again, I learned the issue was not the fault of this card, but MSI's Dragon Center!
After I returned this card I bought the XFX thicc III 5700XT and found it to run even hotter and noisier, and the stuttering was still there. I formatted Windows, everything is clean, got Adrenaline 2020 drivers, all good; but when I installed MSI's Dragon Center my game started to get stuttering. I couldn't identify it was DC causing this because it didn't immediately affect it, remember reading here in an Amazon review to not install DC or the computer will crush. I uninstalled it and the stuttering disappeared like magic.
I returned the XFX card and bought this Red Devil card again and it has not failed once.
Oh, and I changed chassis, too. I had the Thermaltake view 37 ARGB, found out everything was hot in this chassis, bought a few fans, didn't work much (a topic for my review on that chassis). I returned it and bought the view 71TG and the Red Devil is now cooler than ever even without adjusting the fan curve, picking at 86°C junction temperature, and after a small fan curve adjustment it does not get any hotter than 72°C. Impressive how a chassis can hurt your system.

When it worked, it was fan-tastic. Gaming performance was top notch at the price point, but nobody cares about gaming performance if their system restarts randomly twice a day and they lose progress or it causes other errors.

I have used previous HTPC configurations sending HDMI video straight to a projector and HDMI audio (which one can get from the display port using a DP to HDMI adapter cable) to a receiver. The sound I got from the get-go was poor with scratchy, electronic sputtering noises. Then, anytime between 5 minutes up to 65 minutes into a movie, the sound would become accompanied by pops, brief cut-outs, then total sound cut-outs. Rebooting would briefly bring back sound with the same pattern then recurring, only faster suggesting to me a hardware problem as well, perhaps regarding cooling. I would have attributed this defect to some other motherboard or power source or extra-motherboard source but this problem has occurred for many other users across many hardware configurations. The problem continued despite my using the latest AMD driver or older Microsoft high definition audio device drivers. Search ""community.amd RX5700 HDMI and sound problem"" and you'll find a long thread of users documenting this issue across many motherboards and software/hardware scenarios. They also document many failed attempts to have it addressed by the manufacturer.

If you game or stream using headphones using the Realtek outputs you are apparently good, but otherwise beware. Otherwise, the build quality is good, the picture quality of this card is excellent, and it is a very quiet card without whine.

Temperatures are always within a normal range (70s). There's no anteceding drop in frame rate or quality, it just freezes at random.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling all the drivers and tweaking the settings everyway I could (without even getting into things like overclocking, I just mean the simple settings that come with the software) to no avail.

I do have the same driver issues that everyone has heard about, the black screens mostly. I clean the system of old drivers every time. The issues are much less frequent lately and really only occur now with long periods of gaming. As far as the noise levels, default fan curve settings keep it quiet but they are pretty low rpms. If you set them above 50% you are definitely going to hear it and when higher, it reaches that jet engine level. But.. they are some powerful fans and do awesome cooling without having to go that high in my case. Powercolor's rgb software is simple to use and only run it to change light settings, mystic light wouldn't find or control it.

I even order a second one of the same and it still crashed. The second GPU I got the RGB lighting didn’t even work correctly . I think it’s a driver issue from AMD. I hope they fix this soon.

It kept asking me to download the PvT tool. I might go to Nvidia .UPDATE
THE card works . It was my motherboard was having a problem with the A-Xmp and game boost on . It crashed all my games . I fix it by tuning the memory timing and just turning the game boost.

Thermals are not the most important to me, but noise is and the Red Devil is very quiet indeed.
Unfortunately, on linux, the AMD drivers are a bit of a mess and to get both rendering, encoding, and gaming to work using the same driver is almost impossible, for the moment.
In conclusion, if you are a content creator there is only one game in town and thats Nvidia. We can only hope AMD gets it's act together and offers some competition in the future.

I just built my pc and I'm trying to find the right card for it. Due to the next gen GPU shortage, I gave up on waiting and decided to try out some of the older ones, like this rx5700xt here.
For $400, this gpu has great potential and raw processing power. However, the power isn't put to great use because shadow of the tomb raider keeps crashing every 20 minutes. HDR gaming is also terrible because everything is dark for some reason. My PC also crashed multiple times on startup. Seriously, driver support is just terrible.
I also think AMD is lagging behind when it comes to special technologies. FidelityFX doesn't really do anything, compared to Nvidia's DLSS, which significantly decreases heat in my RTX 2070 super.

In conclusion, I would not consider buying an AMD GPU in the future, even if it means spending a little more money for an Nvidia. At least until they fix their software and drivers. I'm using an r5 3600, which is excellent. But not the GPUs."

I’ve owned many graphics cards over the years, most of them nvidia, and really wanted to give AMD a chance with my latest pc build. My Ryzen 3600 is legit; unfortunately this GPU is unacceptable in its current state.

I did a clean install on a brand new computer, and even then, you can’t overclock the GPU without causing even more instability issues.

In the end, I went back to nvidia with the 2070 Super and am very pleased with its stability and performance. Yes, I had to give nvidia more of my money, but that’s a lot easier to swallow than dropping $419 on a card that is simply held back by AMD’s bad drivers."

-Quality hardware
-Triple fans and large heatsink keeps the card cool at almost 100% use (rarely goes passed 73c)
-Quiet
-Awesome design and the addressable RGB is a really nice touch (RGB software is stable and easy to use)

Cons:
-A large and heavy card (make sure it fits in your case before buying and get a support bracket)
-Uses AMD drivers, which have a rough history (I've had a few game crashes on a couple of game)

Overall:
-This is one of the best, if not, the best RX 5700 XT model you can buy. It's a great product for a reasonable price. I don't hold my game crashes against the card, since it's really AMD who is responsible. But the driver has been stable for me almost 99% of the time.

the 5700 XT in general is a situation of great hardware, shaky software. the AMD drivers need a lot more work when it comes to stability and consistency, but that isnt really Powercolor's problem, thats an AMD problem.

I'm sure a few of you have already guessed right now that the modification you think I did was put a water block on for the air cooling solution and you are absolutely correct. I added an Alphacool gpu block specifically for this model card. Gaming with my setup I get pretty damn good fps in some of my favorite titles including Star Citizen, Ghost Recon: Breakpoint (now that they finally fixed that game), Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order among others.

With the air cooling solution I was seeing temps reach into the mid-to-upper 70's which is just fine for your average computer user/gamer. However when playing games that will put you at over 70% gpu usage you will be able to hear the fans whirring. If you're using a good headset instead of speakers you shouldn't be able to notice it too much. Use of speakers may or may not affect this aspect of the experience, but I am not 100% certain as there are only one or two situations where I actually use speakers and those don't stress the gpu enough to cause the fans to ramp up.

Now there are some reports of issues with AMD's drivers. I personally have not had any issues except when I would manually overclock the VRAM and power limits. However, just because I'm not experiencing the problem described by a lot of users does not mean you will not. I simply got lucky. If you really want one of these cards but are afraid of the possibility of those crashes then I would wait until a new driver version comes out. Current version as of this writing on 24 Feb is Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.2.1.

The only reason I will upgrade from this particular gpu any time soon is because Big Navi actually gets released and a more powerful card becomes available at which time this bad boy becomes my wife's. With my Ryzen 9 3950X this card is a great match, but could be better. However, it's currently the best AMD has to offer and I can't complain about it."

But, I found a solution: de-install AMD application/drivers -> works very stable, zero crashes at all, downside - performance is lower by 30%. Instead of 100-120 FPS I'm getting 70-80 ( I play all ""ultra"" on 1440p ).

my thermals are great, I also added 4 extra noctua fans, so it has more than enough air to breath. CPU never goes above 60C, GPU when overclocked is 70C-80C.

Update: I've just get it ( rtx 2070 super ), it is buttery smooth, no crashes, fps always at max 144 even with RTX on in COD ).
It just works!
It delivers better performance, it is noticeable quieter ( 10 db difference, it is really a big difference) , it is smaller, less weigh, less power consumption... Gigabyte RTX 2070 Super Gaming OC definitely worth extra 100$, do NOT buy AMD!!! not for 439..., 5070XT should be priced closer to RTX 2060 S.

speculation: I saw first reviews of AMD 5700xt ( I think it was jay2cents ), the performance was exactly the one I see when I uninstall AMD drivers/soft. Jay then sad that AMD issued a soft update bursting the performance + 30%. I think, AMD did a software trick, so the card become CPU hungry, that explains why some folks get the problem resolved once they set a CPU priority to high & above in task manager for a particular game."

Far quieter and that's at the ""OC"" BIOS selector. In addition that was with the memory and core clocks up a bit in Radeon Settings.

This thing has a ridiculously over-engineered heat sink. It's great. About 2 1/2 inches of heat sink stick off past the PCB with an open backplate. Everything about the PowerColor Red Devil screams quality. I had a PowerColor HD 4870 before my R9 390 and it was a fine card.

I uninstalled my old nvidia drivers (I had an msi gtx 1060 3gb prior) with DDU and installed the current amd drivers from their website. After that I hopped into red dead redemption 2 and immediately saw a huge step up in graphics and frame rate. I was hitting around 80 FPS with high and some ultra settings enabled, which I was happy to see. This card took whatever I threw at it like a champ and hit a maximum temperature of around 72C under full load which to me was incredible. I also saw on YouTube that this card was on par with a 2070 super from nvidia or a little lower for the amazing price of $440 as opposed to some 2070 super’s which were around the $600 mark which was an amazing deal. The next day however the card would freeze up and wouldn’t budge unless I restarted my computer, which would happen every estimated 30 minutes. I reseated my ram, which helped, and I also noticed that the card wasn’t thermal throttling at all. After this issue kept happening, I decided to send it back for a replacement and for the past few days it’s had no issues so far so I think I’m in the clear. I’m really impressed with how this card runs and how fast and good looking this card is. The card is a nice sleek gray and black with a few rgb lights in there but it’s not excessive at all in my opinion. The card also is king of big, as it fit in my atx sized case fine but maybe not so much for micro-atx or itx builds. The card is also quite heavy but wasn’t a problem for my motherboard to hold up.

How about you get your drivers in a functional state instead of trying to make your radeon software look/sound cool. Radeon chill is just an fps limiter. Multiple other stupidly named things that I forget atm. Games not being recognized and the compatibility/upgrades tabs are a joke. It doesn't even recognize my 3700x (an amd processor) as ever being utilized so the overlay is worthless. How about not bundling your crap together like nvidia and maybe you'll have less issues. I understand nvidia control looks like it was made for windows xp but using the meme here ""It just works"" with zero issues. Geforce experience is also optional unlike amd's bloatware.

I wanted this to work and hoped the software/driver issues I read about were behind them but sadly not. I even bought a 3700x to pair with it, which I like. I gave it two weeks of troubleshooting and online fixes but was not going to miss my return window.

Indeed a bit pricey, but it delivers. The software is noticeably different than the 500 series with less complicated OC's and a more persistent fan. If you fine tune the fans, it can keep under 60c under load, but it will get a bit louder than the RX's.

There's a few less bugs in this end than the mid range as well so runs more consistent. I've never used this model when the complaints were abound, but there must've been a big improvement by AMD. I had 2 RX590 XFX(fatboy)'s prior and this card still wins over by around 5% towards games optimized for crossfire. And of course, it's much easier to setup without the added noise of XF so I feel pretty contempt with the one right here.

Looking on the internet, a HUGE amount of people have the exact same problem. If you spend 400 dollars on something, you shouldn't have to disable every good feature it has and undervolt it just to get it to kind of work.

Super disappointed, it has been so awful spending so much time trying to get this thing to work. I will probably never buy any kind of AMD GPU again, mainly because it has been so long and they have yet to address it."

I was very worried about running into some of the driver issues that seem to have plagued these gpus over the years, but so far I have no problems with this particular make/model and the most current available driver for it. Running it along with a Ryzen 5 3600 CPU on an Asus x570 Prime Pro mobo. No crashes, no problems... although it's only been running a few weeks in a brand new build.

When the card is not busy locking your system up it is fast which is a plus. Also, when it is running it is competitive with a Nvidia RTX 2070.

The last time I used a AMD GPU was the Radeon 9200m, so its been awhile. I replaced 2x 970GTX in SLi with the RX 5700XT and am super happy with my new found GPU horsepower. That's about it for the positives, ""its more powerful than my last gpus"". But, everyone was right and I didn't know how right they were until I got my hands on one.... AMD's driver support and GPU control is absolute trash. The Adrenalin software is just garbage compared to even the plain ol Nvidia panel. I don't need my GPU control software to flash ads everywhere . AMD tried to make Adrenalin an all in one, but just made everything so convoluted and scattered. GPU settings should be upfront and the foremost purpose of this software, yet settings and controls are buried behind useless junk in un-intuitive tabs and windows making it a real pain to troubleshoot performance in games. And... games crash, PC locks up, flickering, black screens, etc. like all the time. Every time the event logs show its from a GPU driver crash, regardless of what version it is. Lastly, this wont be an issue for a lot of people, but I can't overstate how much CUDA does for rendering. I am, well, was a heavy blender user and holly molly is gpu rendering out the question without nvidia CUDA. If you use Cycles forget using AMD. I knew the 5700xt wouldnt hold a candle to the 2070super in physical based rendering but to not even touch the performance of a single 970gtx is something I was not expecting. Would I recommend, no.

Plugged it in, made sure my drivers were good, and noted that 1 of my 3 displays was very blurry and stretched. I opened up the display settings and found that suddenly that display was showing as a ""Generic PnP"" monitor. I turned off the PC, unplugged that display, and started it back up with just the two good ones. Now one of the two I had was doing the same thing, plugged into a different display port. While the computer was on I unplugged both displays from the GPU and swapped the ports to see if I could isolate the problem to a display port. Nope, swapped the cables and the same monitor that was bad was still bad...but now the third one was doing it too. Now I had 3 24"" displays stuck in 640x480 resolution with no way to change it. Resolution option greyed out in display settings and AMD software wouldn't allow me to set a custom resolution for the displays to trick it back to 1080p.

I completely uninstalled the AMD drivers and reinstalled them. This did nothing to fix the problem.

I ended up connecting a small TV to the card via HDMI and when it was plugged in by itself, it was working just fine. It recognized the display and allowed me to change the resolution at will. With the tv plugged in I plugged one of the bad displays in again and it was still stuck at 640x480 and unrecognized. While they were still on I swapped the HDMI cables...and suddenly the TV was bumped to 640x480 and no longer recognized.

I brought another computer up and plugged it into one of the displays having problems via HDMI and it was stuck at 640x480 on the other computer as well. I unplugged the HDMI connection and connected via DVI, and everything worked fine. New system recognized the display and allowed me to adjust the resolution. Switch back to HDMI cable, and unrecognized.

I went back to my PC and pulled the new GPU and put the old GPU back in. Connected the displays via HDMI and they were still bad. Plugged the old GPU back into the TV I had, and thankfully the TV came back in 1080p.

Based on everything I've tested, and everything I've tried, the only conclusion I can come to is that this graphics card is somehow corrupting the EDID information on any display it connects to. I now have a $440 graphics card I'm afraid to plug into anything else, and $400 worth of displays that no longer work through their HDMI connection.

I've already contacted Amazon support and they're shipping a replacement...but now I have to go out and buy all new monitors and HOPE that this doesnt happen again with the new GPU and whatever displays I buy.

This is the worst possible outcome I could have expected from buying what should have been a simple GPU upgrade.

UPDATE - I got in touch with Amazon and they replaced the faulty card next day. I replaced the card and used Display port to DVI connectors and got all 3 of my monitors working again. They will still not work on HDMI after the previous fiasco however.

The new card hasn't fried anything, so thats good... and the gaming performance is great. If I had this from the onset it'd be an easy 5 stars, but the fact that none of my displays HDMI ports work anymore, and that it took two cards to fix the situation... 3 stars."

I then bought my friends 980 from him and it also performed well. Then in late 2019 I decided to build my own pc and went AMD instead of Intel for my processor, and I couldn't be happier with the performance upgrade over my old components. When I decided I'd like to get something to replace the 980 in order to future-proof, I was immediately drawn to the 5700 XT and the Red Devil specifically due to the reviews and history of PowerColor being a good manufacturer.

I initially had some issues with Monster Hunter and getting what I believed to be the dreaded black screen error, only to find out that the new 1440p monitor I had purchased to go along with my new card was not plugged in all the way, or had come unplugged partially when I moved some things around. Check your cables! Other than that, the only issue I'd say that I have is that running two monitors (one 1440p at 120hz or 144hz, one 1080p 60hz) maxes out the memory clock. This doesn't impact performance, but it does cause it to draw a little more power and run a few degrees warmer than it should at idle and doing basic tasks. This is a known issue with some AMD and Nvidia cards when running multiple monitors at different refresh rates though, so I can't knock this card for it.

If you're looking for a new card but don't want to shell out for a 2070 or above, this is it. And it's certainly an upgrade from some other comparable cards as well."

Came here to refund, found out my refund window closed literally days after buying the product so I guess I'm now stuck with a 750$ faulty graphics card :)"

 Oh wow where do I start! This is the 2nd card I’ve bought for my new gaming pc in the last month. I originally had the MSI Mech OC, and let me just tell you I took a cut when selling my mech oc so basically SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY ON THIS CARD! This card is not only great for any games( having tested it on warzone, Cold War beta and other AAA titles) but aesthetically it’s amazing, but the best part is the noise and the temps! The hottest it got under 100% load for over 2 hours was 73c and I have a hot case. My last card got up into the high 80s. This card is so quiet that on full fan speed it’s noise is virtually unnoticeable. The mech oc sounded like a jet engine under full load. The rgb is beautiful as well! If you are buying an AMD card, I would go with this one over any other variant, no hesitation."

Paired with a Ryzen 7 2700x and 16GB RAM this card delivers 90ish FPS on Jedi Fallen Order (high settings), 120 FPS for the Outer World's (high settings), 120 FPS on Battlefield V multiplayer (med settings) and 170 FPS on Battlefront II multiplayer. These games all get the GPU around 65 C, +/- 6 C. Note that I bought a large case with lots of airflow, coolermaster mastercase 5, specifically to address potential temp issues associated with the 5700xt cards and I've never had an issue with high temps. Based on the observed performance over two months this card is a great value in performance/dollar. I recommend jayztwocents video from 2019 about this card on YouTube. It is also very quiet, even when the card bios is set to OC. The minor issues are with the AMD driver and the RGB software. The devilzone RGB is pretty bare bones and could be better. While not specific to this card, the AMD driver updates have caused issues, specifically Battlefield V, therefore I think it is worth mentioning in the review. Take proper precautions before updating to a new driver. All around great card"

There have been a few driver updates since I bought the card in January, and each update has drastically improved the performance and stability of the card, and now it runs everything perfectly.

The card is quiet, temps are low, and it isn't too hard on the eyes. There are cheaper 5700XT cards out there, but none give as good performance as this one out of the box. I have a second rig with an RTX2070 Super, and this card gives the same performance for about $100 less.

Its sad that the card isn't $250 as it should be given how small the die is and the age of 7nm. It costs them the same to make this as it did a RX 480 at launch.
Now that amd has real income and can compete we will see a return to normalcy in the GPU space with 50%+ improvement in performance per $ each generation.

Cons:
-Runs super hot at 55-60c idle and 80-95c gaming and you might either need to watercool it or have outtake fans everywhere in your case. (tested and cuts temps by 10c)

The temperatures are excellent, even after a long period of high load, without requiring too much fan speed and noise. When it does perform, it performs brilliantly. But unfortunately, this is a case of GOOD HARDWARE BEING CRIPPLED BY TERRIBLE DRIVERS.

I swapped my old GTX 980 and its drivers back in, and all my display driver crashes and BSOD-less hard resets immediately ceased. I'm refunding and replacing this with an RTX 2070 SUPER, probably from EVGA as I've had good luck with them and their customer support is legendary.

Final advice: Don't buy this card, but pay attention to AMD's GPU offerings in the future. Their actual card designs are excellent and cost-effective, so if they learn their lesson on better drivers, they'll be a serious competitor."

-1060 3gb vs 1060 6gb:
Do you know you have a definite need for the extra vram? if not then I would not recommend a 6gb over a 3gb. 6gb cards are significantly more expensive (~25%-50% more) and for most casual gaming applications you will only see about a 10% difference in performance.
-Dual fan vs single fan
Are you going to be regularly/significantly overclocking? If not then the single fan is plenty for you. I play battlefield 1 on medium-high for hours and this card has zero issues with cooling at all. When you're not playing games this card even runs so cool that it does not require the fan at all and goes into an ""idle"" mode where the fan does not spin to reduce noise. If you do plan on overclocking I would recommend looking into a dual fan card but if not it really isn't worth the money it won't make any significant difference.
-This vs rx580
I believe that this card slightly out performs the rx580. The rx580 beats it in a few areas such as texture detail however overall the 1060 has more areas where it outperforms. This combined with the efficiency of the 1060 is what made me choose it over the 580. Because of this efficiency the 1060 will both use less power and run cooler than a 580 all while being at the same price point. Single fan 580 cards are known to run pretty hot during normal gaming whereas this 1060 hasn't struggled in the cooling department at all in the time I've had it."

If you are as curious as I was to what the difference of single vs twin fan cards are, I found the simple answer browsing some PC build forums.

Basically, a lot of it boils down to looks, and the rest is how far you can overclock past stock.

-PC enthusiasts love beefy, expensive looking cards and equipment to fill out their towers, and twin cards deliver with their bigger case, lights, and backplate. Single fans don't have any of that, but are cheaper as a result.

-Single fan cards also don't stand up to overclocking as much as twin fans because of heat dissipation. That's not to say single fans aren't adequate out of the box. If you don't plan on overclocking, a single fan is just fine and will never overheat. Running at full power on max settings playing OW makes the GPU top out at 72C. If you'd like you can also alter the fan speed settings within the Bios to keep the GPU cooler or quieter.

You really don't need a twin fan model, or really anything above a 1060 if you're a basic gamer that doesn't care about looks and just wants a high performance card you don't plan on messing with. I'm playing on a 144mhz monitor and get 160FPS playing Overwatch on Ultra, and about 100 on Epic. TF2 is beyond easy to play at max and Subnautica looks absolutely beautiful on topped out graphics with no stuttering. My tower is in a somewhat confined space as well and the card has never overheated even in 5+ hours of non-stop gaming.

UPDATE: I downloaded the ""Precision X"" Bios from EVGA and updated the card. It's now faster then ever. Even on stock tune and no overclocking the card is now peaking at 2012mhz, WAY higher than advertised and higher than any stock clocked 1060 on the market. I'm loving this card more every day."

Don't buy a GTX 1080 or GTX 1080 Ti, if you're only gaming on a 1080p monitor with no near-term plans to buy a new display that supports 2560x1440 or 4K. Save your dollars and first buy a new display, then move up to the GTX 1080 Ti, or next generation GeForce cards that ship later in in 2018. In the meantime, stop letting your games stall and drop frames, stop running at lower resolutions, stop running with low quality settings; buy this 1060 now and enjoy games as they were meant to be played! Max/ultra settings applied to just about every game available in the market today runs great at 1920x1080, to include GTA, Arma, COD, COH2, etc. If you ever encounter a slow down, lower the shadows setting for simple fix that isn't typically noticed by most users.

With the above setup, I have so far tested Spiderman Web of Shadows, Sniper Elite 4, and Batman Arkham Knight and have had no issues at all. The only change to any of the default settings on the hardware was to turn on the MSI motherboard's native Game Boost. After that, I installed Windows 10, and since I had no hiccups, I began installing games.

As a plus (because I'm a nostalgic gamer) I have even tested a PS2 emulator, and it's working just like my old Playstation 2 did. As I install more games, I will update my review.

So consider the card 3.5 stars and an additional half star for the quality of service behind the product.

==============================

I bought this card because Amazon wouldn't allow more than one per household on the MSI GTX 1060 AERO ITX model. This card is technically more powerful than that model, being ""superclocked"" and all. And I have to admit, it's a great card. However the enclosure and fan leaves something to be desired.

The fan on this card is much too aggressive. Apparently it initially had a max fan speed of 2600RPM but a BIOS update on later revisions bumped it to 3900RPM after some issues with the EVGA 1070 and 1080 models. This card isn't impacted but I guess it was a precautionary measure. But because of this, the card sounds like a jet engine once you get into the mid-50% speeds on the fan, and the stock fan curve is extremely aggressive, ramping up as high as 70%+ speed when the card is around 70c (when it can easily go up to 80c without any throttling or problems). This was a souce of confusion, since video reviews on the card note it's whisper quiet, but that was way back before the vBIOS was changed.

MSI Afterburner or similar software is a must for this card, not for overclocking, but for fan control. A custom fan curve goes a long way, and you can keep this card at around 75c or below at 100% load with a fan speed of about 52%, at least in my case (Corsair Carbide 100R Silent edition with two front intake 120mm fans and one rear exhause 120mm fan). I highly recommend installing MSI Afterburner or EVGA's own Precision X OC immediately after installing this card and setting your own fan curve. Doing so will turn this card from ""powerful but I don't want to use it"" to just ""powerful.""

So basically, I tentatively recommend this card. It's good, and a fantastic 1080p gaming card, and pretty decent even at 1440p. But without an aftermarket cooler or a custom fan curve it's really noisy.

=========================

Lastly, a note for Linux users:

Obviously you don't have access to tools like MSI Afterburner. That's cool though, you've got bash. I got some help online and came up with a script that controls this card's GPU (well, any Nvidia card) based on the temperature. You can find it at the link below:

https://pastebin.com/2iANCPEy

The script controls the fan by using an offset value to set the fan speed to an offset of the temperature. If the card is below 56c the fan will stay on at 12% speed which is essentially spinning but inaudible. Once it passes that temperature threshold, it sets the fans speed to the temperature plus the offset. In my case an offset of -22 worked well. That way at 60c the fan will be at 38%, at 70c the fan will be at 48%, and so on. Seems to be perfectly adequate for cooling during gaming, and I'm seeing max temps of around 73-74c under load at 51-52% fan speed with the script. You can modify the offset value however works for you.

To run the script, just make a copy locally and save it, chmod the file with a value of 755 (or just chown it, whatever), and call it with ""bash ./filename.sh"" If you do ""bash ./filename.sh -v"" it will do verbose output to the console and display the fan speed and gpu temp at each interval (8 seconds by default). If you're doing this from a remote terminal, you can use ctrl+z and then bg to set it as a background job, or just call it with the & symbol at the end when starting it so it doesn't take over the terminal session.

Be aware, you need to be using the proprietary Nvidia driver for this to work, and you'll need to enable cool bit for fan control via ""sudo nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4"" (or --cool-bits=12 if you'd also like to enable overclocking). Then reboot for the cool-bit value change to take effect. A value of 4 enables manual fan control, 8 for OC in nvidia-settings. 12 enables both. You can also enable voltage control in addition to the rest with a value of 28.

This only works on more recent revisions of the Nvidia driver (I believe versions above 340). I'm on Ubuntu 18.04, and this should work on at minimum 16.04 and up, plus other distros with similar versions and kernels. If you have a really old distro or much older drivers for some reason, you can use the script I originally based mine on, which can be found at the link below:

So this review will mostly be only about the performance of the unit, and no comparisons.

So I stuck this into the Acer TC-780 Desktop along with a nicer PSU. The case was a bit of a tight fit, but it works as intended.

I initially had issues with the card, occasionally it would turn completely off leaving me with a black screen, this may have been a power issue because after unplugging many of my consoles, I have had no issues and it now performs well.

It runs many older games decently at 4k, and I can get some newer games to operate well at that resolution, the card has issues properly handling it. However many games released in the last three years run amazing at 1080p or 1440p and the GTX 1060 handles most games well, even heavily demanding games like The Witcher 3. However I did have many many issues with Assassin's Creed Origins, although that was probably more of an issue with the game itself. When fully utilized in a game, the max temperature I've had has been 75°C with no overclocking. When I was benchmarking with a small overclock, it had reached 80°C but that probably will never happen within a game. About overclocking, this card handles it ""okay"" but hasn't wowed me. Anything over a +125 mhz overclock causes games to crash and I can't push memory clocks too high as it does cause artifacting among other issues. Overclocking the card does definitely help performance in some games if you favor a higher resolution like I do, but don't want to sacrifice fps too much.

Overall, for my budget, it's a great GPU and it runs laps around the PS4 and Xbox One that I'm used to playing games on. I'm hoping that this review is somewhat informative."

I ultimately went with this 1060 6GB SC from EVGA as I could keep my current power supply unit, and didn't need to replace my 6 pin connector (which would have added to the cost up front and slightly higher electric demand). I'm not considering using ultra-high graphics or manually overclocking this GPU anyways. My logic was it would last me about as long as a console, but was happy to noticed it improved the quality of the display for images/movies over the original, lower-performing 730 GPU. So I might even be able to benefit from it longer still.

Installation: I use Windows 10--not sure if this is important, but maybe helpful for you. I've never installed a graphics card in my life, so after reading/watching how it was done online, I found it superbly easy once inside the machine. Ridiculously easy even. I did have some trouble with the software installing from CD (the EVGA website has it anyways all nicely updated so it saves time from needing a second update), but the included benchmarking software (including one for VR) went on a-okay. Was way easier then expected.

Impressions during play/viewing: Remember how I said my old, basic 730 GPU couldn't keep up with newer games? This1060 SC graphics card fixes a 1-5 second processing delay the old GPU gave me (and I was really sacrificing graphics quality on that old card). Now, I am running with higher quality graphic settings in-game and my gameplay is no longer lagging from intense graphics. No problems yet during gameplay with STEAM's and NVIDIA software's recommended settings, and the only periods in gameplay it seemed to have trouble with was graphically intense cutscenes. [Not sure if that is really this card's fault as the game is a hybrid between local files and network connection.] The fan on this card is probably the noisiest one on my whole desktop (become aware when the fan kicks up, but it's nowhere near jump-scaring me), but I hear that noise level is common across all these NVIDIA 10-series GPUs. I'm glad EVGA designs their fans to be slightly quieter because of this. Other games that worked with my old GPU (think RPGs, World of Warships, etc) actually look sharper for better or worse (it highlights quality of detail the designers put into it the game, but also highlights some of the graphical imperfections--still not complaining though since stuff loads great at on good quality settings). Outside of gameplay, my background images that cycle for my PC are significantly enhanced both in textures and colors. To give you an idea, one of my backgrounds is a landscape that has a brushstroke effect that is now showing up significantly clearer--something I could notice on my old 730 GPU, but nothing with this detail.

Other impressions: It's not a full-length desktop card, but the card has significant bulk and heft to it. Was actually surprised by the size and how sturdy it looked and felt since I mostly know friends that use gaming laptops. As far as detail goes, others are commenting on how much sharper things look from my PC now, and I haven't even changed my monitor! I'm sure this already is obvious, but if you are gaming expect heat generation. Keep that in mind in case its hot outside or now that winter is coming.

Will update should anything change or find something else out that's cool about it."

I did use the following products also to overclock with this:

Thermal Grizzly Liquid Metal ( Warning this probably does void your warranty - I used this to replace the stock GPU Paste )
Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease Paste - 1.0 Gram

Titan Adjustable PCIE FAN ( Placed under the EVGA GTX 1060 for increased airflow )
Titan Adjustable Dual Fan PCI Slot VGA Cooler (TTC-SC07TZ)

Sally Hansen Clear Nail Polish ( For covering the capacitors and power connectors around the GPU because Nail Polish is Non-Conductive )
Sally Hansen Color Therapy Nail Polish, Top Coat 0.5 Ounce Long-Lasting Nail Polish with Gel Shine and Nourishing Care

DISCLAIMER: I don't recommend you try the modifications I have in my review unless you know what you are doing, do so at your own risk as this most likely will void your warranty. But if $350 doesn't matter to you and you are an expert, then read on.

I first unscrewed the cooler from the Graphics Card on the back plate with 4 phillips screws and disconnected the side fan connector, this exposed the copper heat sink and the GPU. I used Alcohol Wipes to gently remove all of the stock GPU Paste and waited a few minutes to dry, then I used the Sally Hansen Color Theraphy Nail Polish, which by the way is NON CONDUCTIVE and is safe to use, by applying it around the GPU Die on the capacitors and power connectors creating a protective cover. I waited 10 minutes for it to dry and then applied 3 more layers, this was done to prevent a power short circuit in case liquid metal got on the capacitors around the GPU Die. Just to be clear the Nail Polish was placed around the GPU and note directly on it. Once the Capacitors were completely covered in Nail Polish, I placed a pea sides amount of liquid metal on the GPU Die and used the QTIP to spread it nice and evenly on the GPU Die like butter.

Turning on my computer the Idle Temperature went from 42 Degrees Stock Paste to 36 Degrees Ambient Temperature with the Liquid Metal.

Starting off with testing, I did download the latest drivers from EVGA Website and as of this review it is display driver 398.11 with BIOS 86.06.68.00.62 as of 06/06/2018.

Stock the card does come with a stock clock speed of 1607 MHz / Real Boost Clock: 1835 MHz. However, I was able to get that up to 2164 Mhz on the GPU Clock and 4498 Mhz on the Memory clock.

Using the following settings with my modifications, I downloaded EVGA Precision OC from EVGA's website and also EVGA Scanner X

For EVGA Precision OC I used the following settings:

Turn on KBOOST ( Forces GPU to operate at full boost clock 100% of the time)

120% Power Target (This is your TDP - Thermal Design Power) - Gives your Graphics Card 20% more power for higher overclocks
Break the link for both Power Target and Temperature ( You want this so that you get more power regardless of temperature)
Set Priority to Power Target

For Voltage I set it to 70%
For Fan Speed, I set it to 70% ( It's loud but I can use a Gaming Headset )

GPU Clock Speed Offset set to +160 Mhz
Memory Clock Offset set to +496 Mhz

Also Motherboard Southbridge Voltage was increased to 1.25 Volts, VDDR Voltage increased to 1.25 Volts, VDDR PCIE Voltage increased to 1.25 Volts. This was done to increase power delivery to the Graphics Card from the PCIE Slot on the motherboard due to the high 120% TDP.

Running a stress test for at 4K Resolution at 3840 x 2160 Pixels with 8X MSAA produced a steady frame rate of 43 Frames Per Second at 65 Degrees Celcius, up from 10 Frames Per Second at stock and this test ran for 10 minutes rendering over 25,000 Frames without crashing.

This pretty much turned my GTX 1060 into a GTX 1070 for a much lower price as the 1070's sell for about $500 and made gaming at 4K on the 1060 to be actually playable.

Gamers probably won't need to run 8X MSAA and can do just fine with 2X MSAA when Gaming at 4K with my modifications since you can't really notice jagged edges at 2X Anti Aliasing and 4K and overclocked the frames never ran below 30 Frames per second.

Final Conclusion:

The EVGA GTX 1060 6GB overclocks like a champ and with liquid metal, great cooling fans from your case and a PCIE Fan Cooler, you can easily turn your overclocked 1060 into a stock 1070 when running at 4K Resolution that is 24/7 Stable. Your results may vary with the Silicon Lottery, but I highly recommend this product if you are buying it with overclocking in mind, it does great. Pushing it past 2,200 Mhz however did not happen for me and most I was able to do was 2164 Mhz, it is probably possible to go to 2,200 Mhz by doing shunting mods, but that is probably a 2-4% increase in performance from 2164 Mhz and honestly not worth it IMO."

With a target price of $200ish, I spent a couple of days researching the options. I have been a satisfied NVidia user for years, and focused on their line of processors.
The final options were the GTX 1050Ti 4GB VRAM and the GTX 1060 3 or 6 GB VRAM, all in the SuperClocked (SC) version (with SC the card automatically overclocks itself in demand within maximum temperature/frequency limits, a great feature for an additional ~$10).
I chose the GTX 1060/3GB as the best ""bang for the buck"", as it was reviewed and benchmarked significantly faster than the 1050 for a slight cost premium, and the slight additional performance of the 6GB version over the 3GB wasn't justified by the additional cost, and my requirement for less than maximum gaming performance at 1080P, 150 FPS and Ultra resolution settings...
One thing I learned was that the GTX 1050 cards install without an additional power connection, while the GTX 1060 and up require a 6 pin power connector from the power supply. In many modern computers, this connector is supplied, but in older PCs, it may be missing, but that can be ""worked around"" with a MOLEX/6 pin adapter.
When it came to which manufacturer to use, the EVGA rated the best value and performance, so it was the vendor of choice.
Installation was painless, but many web reviews recommended upgrading the BIOS to the latest version to ensure the XPS 8900 would boot properly. *

* An ancillary problem with the BIOS upgrade was that after updating the BIOS, I logged in to Windows 10 with my personal ID, but the PC booted into the generic ADMINISTRATOR account. The result was that it booted into the bare bones blue generic Windows desktop, with all but a dozen of my desktop shortcuts missing... After some colorful language, I accidentally discovered that Windows had somehow booted into Win 10 from my log in to the ADMIN account..."

I bought this card worried about just that, and let me tell you, I'm eagerly surprised. I haven't taken the shroud off of the card to put new paste on it either; a proper fan profile with Afterburner or PrecisionX and you'll be just fine. I haven't seen my card go over 63C, and it's rated to tolerate much higher. Plus, in Afterburner it autoclocks it to 2000MHz, though it runs anywhere from 400 to 1600 with idling and light gaming.

The most 'intensive' games I play revolves around Doom (2016), Rust, GTA V, Metro Last Light and The Forest. I don't know the exact average, but I'll put what I remember from said games in regards to frames per second.

Also keep in mind the processor can also affect performance, as well as the RAM when it comes to Ryzen. I'm using a Ryzen 5 1600 and 8GB Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM.

Doom: Ran everything on Ultra/highest possible settings on everything, 1920 x 1080. Dipped slightly below 60FPS once in a blue moon, but never under 57FPS. Very smooth.

Rust: Honestly Rust still has some sketchy optimization, but it never drops under 70FPS (1920 x 1080, minimal settings w/FXAA on and a render distance of 2,500) for me. I've also played w/everything maxed out on some empty/almost empty servers and averaged right around 85FPS. Of course, that's an empty world; a populated world got me right around 45FPS (200 out of 300 slots being played) which is playable, but definitely not recommended for a game like Rust.

Metro Last Light: Never went below 60 FPS. Everything on Ultra, 1920 x 1080. If you never want to go below 60FPS with the same setup as I have, just turn everything on High instead of Ultra. The look is negligibly different.

The Forest: Is optimized horribly, so your experience may vary. Usually 50+ FPS on mid-high settings, but going Ultra on a game that's still in alpha is honestly a stupid decision anyhow.

GTA V: Most settings on High, population density smack dab in the middle. Game looks pretty, never drops below 75FPS. 1920 x 1080.

I love this little card. It's cute as a button but performs like an Olympian."

But as for Ubuntu, b/c I am using an AMD mobo, I have no integrated graphics card. This means that I need to have the drivers for this new graphics card installed BEFORE I install this card.
Thus, I ended up installing the card first - nothing on my screen. -Panic-
Reinstalled my old card - googled bunch of solutions for 20-30 minutes
Finally found the right one - plugged the card back in after installing the required drivers + purging old ones.
It worked! Finally.
Anyways, I am just thankful that people care about linux users period, so I don't blame any company etc.
As for performance, I mainly just got it since I wanted to support a 4k monitor - and it's ballin'! I love it.
As for gaming, I can run starcraft 2 on Medium with no issues with fps running 4k - really depends on the map though. Some campaign maps are super full with stuff + it get's slow unless I drag it down to low. But that's 4k for ya.
So if you want to just run games - set it to 1080p.
I can run league of legends on max settings with no issues fps wise running 4k.
I mean it's hard to be attached to something that just gives you ability to run things - so I don't really love it or hate it - but I am glad it just works as intended. 4k ftw! I am tired of writing papers on 1080p - hurts my eyes so bad."

The installation was absurdly easy, and the smaller form factor fit in very simply to the area provided. However, the small case has real issues with the heat this thing throws off. To compensate for the small, hot air pocket that it inevitably ends up sitting it it has to crank up the fan speed. It is loud, really loud. Like the old days of custom hack saws and fan mods days loud. You better have some sound dampening headphones.

Ok, yes, I know. The 660 is several generations older and so of course the 1060 would be faster, duh. However, what I am so impressed with is how well this card performs when gaming at 1080p @ 60Hz, meaning you don't need more than 60fps. I'm able to game at high or ultra settings on games like Fallout 4, Batman Arkham Knight, Crysis 3, Titanfall, Witcher 3 and others at or above 60fps average. There are dips in frames, but this is due more to my CPU than the card. I'm currently using an AMD FX 4350 OC'd to 4.6Ghz, and it just can't keep this GPU fed with enough data. Card sits at times at about 35%-45% utilization while my CPU is pegged at or near 99%, so CPU bottleneck.

I would recommend this card to anyone looking to game at 1080p @ 60fps on triple-A titles. (If you play WOW, Rocket League, or esport games then go with the 1050ti.) The single fan does plenty to keep the card cooled, and with good airflow in your case it can actually overclock itself even higher. The 3GB VRam does impose a limit on 1440p gaming (lower fps), and 4k is a no-go on most titles, but for those of us on 1080p monitors this card is a beast."

I got this quite a few months back, and at the time graphics cards were still at a premium due to crypto currency mining. I researched performance of the different models, and realized the 1060s were far better than the 1050s, and only slightly slower than the 1070s, with the 1080s being way out of my price range. And despite some really adamant bloggers complaining about the diminished architecture of the 3GB version, in real world performance testing, the 3gb and 6gb cards were functioning nearly identical. So when this particular card went on sale, I jumped on it. I've had no problems with EVGA products in the past, and they tend to out preform the competition with their OC models.

One nice thing is size. It was easier to both install and remove, because there isn't more card blocking access to the PCIe x16 riser lock. When everything else is hooked up, that can be difficult to get to.

Another great thing is that it needs just a single fan. That means it's quiet. And unless the graphics are getting really intense, that fan doesn't even need to run much of the time.

This card comes with a good combination of ports. Ok, so to hook up all there of my dvi monitors, I had to buy two new cables, but it does support several monitors, which is great when working from home.

Note: I honestly haven't looked into whether or not this card supports 3d output to multiple monitors, since most games do a terrible job of supporting it.

I'm not an FPS fan, but I did want better performance and quality from the games I do play (Battletech, Fallout, a bunch of steam games, etc.). This card was an upgrade to my old PC, replacing a GTX570, and it significantly improved my frame rates, with higher quality settings.

I've since built a new PC based off the i5-9600k, and this is still a perfect video card for what I'm playing right now. I'm playing all my games on the highest quality settings, and maxing the refresh rate of my aging 60Hz monitors. I expect I'll upgrade in a year or two, and probably buy a new gaming monitor at that time, too. For now, this still meet my needs, and I'm very happy with it.

I haven't seen any graphical glitches, or had any crashes. The Nvidia driver installs are flawless, as always.

There is a utility from EVGA, Precision XOC, that looks great for those that really want to control their overclock settings, but I haven't had need to mess with it at all."

Gaming on this setup is actually pretty good, especially for older titles that are still fun to play. Even the new DOOM game will run at full detail using the new Vulkan API update. Now, this is not as powerful as a GTX 1080Ti but its no slouch either and doesn't have a huge power draw. This is a great pairing for a 1080p monitor if you are a gamer on a budget.

It runs fine but my only issue with it is that it runs very hot playing any game other than less demanding games like csgo. Turns out the heatsink on this card has no heatpipes and it looks very similar the heatsink you'd see on a stock ryzen cpu cooler. Therefore whenever she plays any AAA titles or other demanding games it immediately hits 82c (the stock temp target which i haven't changed) and the fan whirs up very loudly. The SC variant of this card has a better heatsink with copper heatpipes that presumably should cool the card much better. I've considered getting an aftermarket cooler for this card but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Perhaps if I ever install it I'll give an update here."

Both are lame options since paying $1,000’s of dollars for a card today that will be outdated in a month or two is crazy but waiting two or more months without being able to use my beautiful new PC would drive me just as crazy.

So, I settled on a compromise. I was able to find the EVGA - GeForce GTX 1060 3GB SC GAMING Video Card on Amazon for $230 which will allow me to use my new PC with consistent fps at 1080p while I wait a couple of months for the newer Turing cards to come out.

Now we can play all our games on ultra with all the driver settings maxed out and still get 60fps on a 1080p monitor. And now everything plays way more smoothly than ever before.

A couple of weeks ago, I lucked out and got them for less than $250 each. Now they're well over $300. If the prices drop back down to below $250, I totally recommend this card.

(06G-P4-6161-KR),"Well, hmm. MONSTER card for what I use it for! I like to game a bit and this card was more than I originally thought it would be. I had the 1050 2gb before I got this and didn’t think it would be a big jump, but I was wrong! The 6gb or vram make all the difference! Now I don’t have to worry about the textures loading only 10-15 ft in front of my characters ha. Definitely a good thing for the visuals! So you have a better idea of why it works well for me, I use:

Windows 10 Pro 64 bit
Intel i5-2500 3.3Ghz
16GB RAM DDR3
43” Visio Tv hooked up via HDMI

This card has upgraded my pc immensely from my 1050 2gb that I was using before! For video and surfing the web it seems everything is loading almost instantly. For gaming, I’ve been able to ramp up settings full tilt on everything I play. I’ve over clocked this card an it took a few to get it to be both more powerful AND stable. After finding a sweet spot this card has managed to destroy what I throw at it!

Assassins Creed Odyssey - Max settings is not exactly 60fps but you hardly notice it.
Metro Exodus - Pretty damned good performance. Also not exactly 60 fps but you wouldn't know it.
Fallout 4 is a breeze even with all the mods I have installed. 45+ 60fps almost always with a few drops
Pro Evo 19 is a walk in the park. 60fps
Far Cry 5 is a stroll. 60fps
Subnautica is beautiful when I play.
MGS V . Forget about it haha. 60fps
Ghost recon Wildlands is now so detailed its ridiculous. 60fps
Madden 19 has the slowest load times ever! But I highly doubt it’s the cards fault. Outside of loading the game plays buttery smooth!
BATMAN Arkham City isn’t even close to a problem. 60fps
NBA2k19 has some small stutters but plays so well!

Every game I’ve mentioned is at ULTRA/highest settings except fallout 4 (removed god rays cause it’s only good for video capture or screen shots).

I’m impressed by this card! I’d recommend it and as a plus I got it for $219 on thanksgiving day I think sooo DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY PENNY 😎

Edited: Found out why I got stuttering. Non stable overclock. Also updated games played. Added Metro Exodus and AC Odyssey."

Overall I can play all game releases current and past at 1080 resolution with high to very high to ultra setting easily at > 40-50 fps. A quick search online will verify expected performance of this card. The fan control is good and it manages to hover around 55-60c on high load games. I have not tried 4K resolution but feel that it would likely not handle this well at high game settings. No stuttering or crashes in games. Ideally I would have loved the 6gb version but the insane prices make this not feasible.

When I was gaming on it, I played GTA V and online, Fallout 4, Fallout 76, arma 3, dying light, borderlands 2, and it was playable. The 1100T holds the GTX 1060 back in the form of frametime. It doesn't bottleneck, but it did stutter because the processor couldn't keep up. I loved the smaller form factor, as my next build was going to be an itx or micro atx, but i didnt get the chance to do that.

Well, holy pixels, Batman! Was I ever wrong. This card is blisteringly fast AND quiet. In fact, it makes less noise than my 120mm Enermax super quiet case fan. I think I can eve hear my old 7200 rpm D drive spinning in there!

Fired up Warframe and it runs highest settings (all the AA, filtering, bloom, you name it) in 1920x1080 (DVI,60hz) without breaking a sweat. I even did a Void run with a full 4 player squad, place was lit up like Christmas and the 4th of July in Times Square on New Years and nary a frame rate drop was noticed.

I consistently get 100+ FPS on most games, and up to 200 FPS on light-weight games like CS:GO and Rocket League. With only one fan, this card is practically silent, and it's very small as well.

With the previous GPU (GTX 750 Ti FTW) I could run Final Fantasy 14 on Medium/high settings ranging from 40-50 FPS at 60hz.

Upgraded to this GTX 1060 and enabled 144hz, put the game on Maximum settings, and I run at a constant 70 -100 FPS. Man, what a difference. 144hz is amazing to game with.

However, the card makes a lot of noise when I play FF14 and Rocket League. I'm slightly concerned with how loud the fan is, and I'm starting to think I should have gone with the dual fan version of the 1060. It could be something else causing this, but I haven't over-clocked anything.

I recently upgraded to a 1440p 144hz Gsync monitor and this card still performs really well, well above 60fps if you are willing to play on Medium to high settings.

If you want to break 144fps on 1440p with this card, be willing to turn settings down to low or hope the game is well optimized like Fortnite or Overwatch. This card idles for me around 37c and peaks temps during gameplay have been no hotter than 66c or so. If you can find one around MSRP price, its a no brainer for 1080p gaming or low to medium 1440p gaming. Fan is rather loud since its a single fan card but if you game with a headset on, you wont notice it. Fan does not turn on until card breaks 44c for me which means its silent when I am not gaming.

I was running everything on max with ease. The problem however is it's extremely hot. Any reports mentioning that heat is not an exaggeration, and it has a single fan. Within three days mine finally gave up with a hard boot and now every type of video hard artifacts and games run at 25 frames or less before crashing.

I've had defective cards in the past so I suppose it isn't unique to this one, but now that I have the problem and I'm looking over the other reviews I can very must attest that these people aren't exaggerating and that these are reoccurring problems that should be addressed. I would say take it seriously and perhaps invest in a card that, at minimum, at least runs cooler. No amount of Customer Support copypasta is going to change that.

I was honestly considering dropping a one star because I'm kind of irritated that I can't exchange for another card to just see if it was a manufacturing error, but sending it, then waiting another week for a refund, then purchasing it would make me out of a GPU for two weeks. No thank you. Rating that criticism on the card itself seemed too harsh.

tl;dr: When you buy this card, you're gambling on how long it'll last. If you get a good one, congratulations, enjoy a pretty solid card at a very good price. Don't be surprised if it doesn't last."

This one is fine though and I ended up keeping this one since the 6GB requires a available 8-pin PCIE power plug and my PS doesn't have one available. If you have an 8-pin, get the MSI card.

But overall the 1060 is a nice card and install easily. Gives better benchmarks than expected and pushes 4k, though all I'm using it for is to play Age II HD. Works like a charm."

I probably would have bought the GTX 1050, but I have a 1080p monitor and had read that this card was better for my resolution, plus I have always tried to avoid 128-bit cards. This one is 192-bit.
I am amazed at what these cards cost now. I payed $189.99, which is considerably less than what supply and demand has done to the costs. Kinda sad really. I wouldn't have been able to afford the current cost of $335.81"

This has kept up well with new releases that I've played so I'll probably keep using this for years to come.

TWO YEAR UPDATE: So my graphics card started to mess up and had to contact EVGA about it. After some troubleshooting they concluded my gpu was defective and sent me the information to get it replaced. I did have to pay shipping for sending my gpu back but the new one was no extra cost and they paid for that shipping. So far this new one is working just as well as my old one did before messing up.

Everything I've tested so far has run at no less than 60fps even when there's a lot going on onscreen, and that's usually with maxed out settings. The 3GB of vram is enough to get the job done in most cases and you're only going to run into lower fps than that if you're trying to go for the extra high Anti Aliasing or uncompressed HD textures that some games offer. But at that point its only because you'd need more than 3GB to support that. In which case the 6GB model is what you'd want anyway to begin with. In either case this card isn't super expensive so if you're looking to work with a budget I'd save a few bucks more to get this over the 1050ti despite it having a little more vram and being slightly cheaper.

Set to its power-saving profile the fan gets up to 50% and is very quiet--keeping the card at 82 Celsius or lower (the card will throttle back at 83 degrees). Since the safe temperature for the card is well into the 90s, I'm comfortable running it with the lower fan curve and hopefully extending the life of the fan a bit.

Don't waste your money on anything less, and don't feel like you have to shell out the big bucks for a better card, this one is quite adequate right now.

I plugged this in and set everything up, only to not have the computer boot correctly or recognize the device. I called EVGA for help to be told that the device probably won't work with my computer that has the VGA internalized with the mother board. It took my 15 year old son to realize that we never moved the plug for the video screen from the original plug in the back of the mother board to the new plug of the new video card. DUH! I can't believe I neglected to do that. We also disabled the original video card (via instructions found on the web). And now it works perfectly. Granted it's too fast for the other components my slightly outdated computer has, but once we set the graphics speed lower, at least we can run much higher level games now that used to lag badly."

I also, play a couple of games (WoT, Sniper Elite) on ultimate settings and get frame rates of 60+ on all of them. That is not why I got the card those so that is just a bonus. I'm running it on windows 10 and I have not even thought about the drivers for it.

After tax it was over $100 the MSRP of $250. you can buy used cards around that price, but I'm going to sell this to a friend once new cards come out and it makes it better for him knowing it was recently new and taken care of.

Now to the actual performance! If you've got 1080p, you're pretty set. I came from a 660 2GB that was running into walls with large worlds. My VRAM would be eaten up quite fast! In Fary Cry 5 I had to set everything to low and play at 1600 x 900.
Now I have it up to ULTRA and 1080p with over 3.8 GB Vram to spare! Wildlands uses the most taking up a little over 4GB with everything cranked up. But most importantly, I can FINALLY play Just Cause 3! It ran pretty poorly on my 660, but after this it's buttery smooth and I'm blowing up all sorts of things!
It fit in my case pretty easily. It also doesn't get hot for me so far, so it has not been loud at all.
It's like when I bought my 9800 GTX+, then my 460, then my 660, and now my 1060.... The feeling of cranking up details and settings after dealing with lower settings is a fantastic feeling."

It was pretty much plug and play. Packaging was decent with bubble wrap protecting the card, and after removing all the plastics protecting the pretty glossy detailing on the card, installation was pretty much a breeze.

Put the card through it's paces using EVGA's Precision XOC. Managed to retain steady temperatures of around 60 - 65C with a custom aggressive fan curve, and this is maxing out the voltage and temperature limits (priority temps). This card did come overclocked out of the factory, but I managed to push it beyond stock clock by 150 mhz for both memory and clock speeds.

Witcher 3 on ultra with reduced settings on hair works and shadows was easily handled with frame rates well above 60, overwatch could be maxed out at epic while maintaining 90 - 10 FPS, and funnily enough, Borderlands the Pre Sequel was the most demanding of the lot thanks to NVIDIA PhysX, which I heard was very demanding.

For the decent price (got it at 176 USD), I cannot complain. It's a very decent card which can maintain steady temperatures provided you do not mind the fan noise. Honestly, when the game volume's up you cannot notice the fans. I kept them running at about 80-90% to maintain such temperatures.

Will definitely purchase my next upgrade from EVGA in the future."

Remove rubber electrical from electrical connector

Insert gps in slot , apply slot clamp apply screws, apply connector.

The card is good in what you would typically expect the 1060 to be, but the card started to malfunction around February of this year. It will sometimes give visual bugs and sometimes will freeze the graphics of games. I decided enough was enough and used NovaBench to test the graphics card health.. it was 200 points off of what you would typically expect the life of the graphics card to be, and it has only roughly been used for about a year.

If you want to buy this card after reading this, then I caution you to buy the graphics card in-store at a Best Buy or Frys or buy a different brand. I will be upgrading the card soon, but I will admit I am really disappointed on the outcome of this graphics card. I’ve been a big fan of EVGA for my first computer build as it is inexpensive and worked just at great as the others, but this issue really will turn me away from buying future graphics cards from EVGA and other products from them.

It handles everything I throw at it without a problem. The only problem I came into is that it was running over 80*c and that is just a bit warm for me. I looked at the fan ramp speed and in stock form it is horrible. At 80*c it was only running at 40% of the fan speed capability. I changed the ramp speed to where it goes 100% fan speed and it stays around 65*c and I could go cooler if I had a bigger case but I can live with 65*c. I would give this card a 5 stars but I can't give it a 4.5 so just went with a 4 star rating due to the fan speed from factory.

Pros:
Stays much cooler than previous card (GTX750ti SC)
GPU Boost Clock speeds run higher than advertised and stay stable when card is cooler.
Super Quiet
OCX is easy to use, and works great.

Cons:
None yet.

I bought this card in anticipation for Battlefield 1. It has exceeded my expectations greatly. Fallout 4 never drops below 46 fps even during prolonged battles with multiple characters on screen. GTA V in the 90fps. Crysis 75-175 fps lol. Overclocking software is easy to use and very stable. I have not seen this card get warmer than 70C. If you are looking at this card, I highly recommend it. Great Value."

Basic overclocked it is at 19. Could have went further but like I said I am not hardcore and this was just for simple past time when PC is not in use.

It is really quite, and the fan so far has not went above 60. Runs cool, even under high load. The single fan is nothing to worry about."

Malfunction of this card is not noticeable until the card is used in a way that requires all its CUDA cores. For example, I use the card for number crunching doing grid computing. This card is doing half as much work as any one of the other four (4) GTX 1060 3MB cards I own. I moved the card to a second identical known good computer with the same bad results. Therefore, the problem is with the card, not the host computer.

Secondly, a previous Amazon customer returned this defective card to Amazon before it was resold to me. How do I know? Because my package mistakenly contained a “riser adapter” that only crypto miners use. No Riser adapter comes with the stock GTX 1060. Therefore, the crypto miner discovered the same problem I have discovered. I believe the first owner returned the card before Amazon Warehouse wrongly declared the card is good, then resold it to me.

I've been on an Nvidia GTX 760 SC that was manufactured by EVGA for around 2 and a half years and it was beginning to show it's age somewhat. There would be stutters and sometimes crazy framerates(Not unplayable however) on certain games (Overwatch and Witcher 3:Wild Hunt being big ones that come to mind) and sure I could downgrade some of my settings to achieve a more stable framerate but I wanted to really push cards to their limits and enjoy 1080P PC gaming at it's best. I assumed it was time to upgrade because I wanted to play on maximum settings on games and prepare my computer for upcoming titles such as Destiny 2 and Assassins Creed: Origins for example. Six months later after owning this card, I can definately say it's one of the smarter purchases I've made.

How well does it run games and is it loud or does it get hot?:
For 1080P gaming this will suit your needs as of now(9/9/17) and most likely for the next few years. The specs on this card compare to the Nvidia GTX 980 but it's ever so slightly worse in some situations or better in others. It all boils down to how well optimized the game actually is. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt saw a performance increase of almost double at 1080P with ultra settings, going from about an average of 25FPS with the 760 SC to about 60 FPS in a lot of places except for densely populated places with the 1060 SSC!
The card also runs very quietly and very efficiently as well. The fans are actually one of the more impressive parts believe it or not. The way they're designed to last almost four times as long(We'll see about that!) and with proper ventilation of heat, could not turn at all(It's a good thing actually, that's how they're supposed to work) to keep power costs lower. When actually gaming or doing strenuous tasks the fans will turn obviously. Heat isn't an issue if even if you have the most basic form of ventilation(like I do and which is why I bought the double fan) The card fits into a mid tower case which is also nice.

Why this card would be good for you:
It may seem like I'm worshipping this graphics card, but I won't deny it has a specific role and if used for other things that isn't 1080P you're either paying too much or didn't get a beefy enough GPU. For example, if you plan to go onto 1440P or 4k gaming, don't bother with this and stead go to the GTX 1070 or GTX 1080. The GTX 1060 won't able to match the performance of those cards with that type of resolution, it's built for great 1080P gaming. Also if you're comming from the 900 series, more specifically the GTX 970 or 980 and especially the 980 TI, you wouldn't get much of a performace gain and in the case of the 980 TI, will be a downgrade in terms of performance. If you're comming from the 700 Series, before that even or switching from AMD to Nvidia and want some of the best cost performance 1080P graphics cards, this is rightfully for you!

TL:DR: Upgraded from a 760 SC from EVGA to this, great performance, quiet, no bad heating, recommended for 1080P gaming or for those looking to upgrade from an older card that isn't from the 900 series as it offers similar performance to them."

As with most cards, knowing what is running is important. So playing PUBG on a step above 1080p (not 4k, I think it is 1980x1200), 12 GB DDR3, solid state hard drive and i7 960 (its been a while but it is still ticking), I get about 50-60 fps pretty consistently on the highest settings.

phenomenal UserBenchMark Gaming score went from 17% (Surfboard) to 77% (Battleship)

Starcraft II went from 1 FPS with Over 600 hundred units attacking at Medium graphics to 69 FPS at Extreme graphics settings.

In general I am pleased with this card. I got the 3GB version, but really, there just aren't many games that need 6gb or 8gb. I would say that this is the perfect card for 1080P gamers.

Most of them at 4K, a few are dialed back for thermal reasons, still much better than ""full HD."" It was a great value in December at $250.

Cons: It's excessively noisy (70dB, on par with a hair dryer), because it has only one fan and my case is small. If you are buying this card for a small case, you may encounter the same issue.

The 660 was a great card. i also have a 1070 in another PC (great card) This card ran So hot it could not even run the Software it Came with. So I uninstalled everything reinstalled it clean. but It would pause when opening folders. Fan was on High Speed.. and Crashed with the provided software for Benchmarks. It is possible I got a bad Card but it just seemed to been cooled terribly. Amazon Was Very Good about letting me return the Card. I regretted buying it 2 hours after installing it. 5 stars for Amazon Support. but in my experance I can not recommend this card in good faith. All reviews I read on and off this site raved about this card. I am not attacking EVGA i've have had many of their cards and worked fantastic.

The GPU temps run idle at around 30c, and the fans are super quiet. The best part was that the card is smaller than my old ASUS STRIX GeForce GTX 970 Overclocked 4 GB, so lots more room in my mATX case.

I game on Linux Manjaro, and wish Nvidia worked with the open source community more, my only negative towards the company, not the card. Still, they do release proprietary drives to linux, and they run just as smoothly on linux as they do on Micro$oft. Love the card...buy it!!"

I had to replace a Radeon card, the card was good but the software/drivers were janky and were so fussy with various video playback that I couldn't take it. I went to this 1660 Super, for about $200 shipped and it works perfectly right out of the box, no fuss, it's a smaller card, fits in my tiny case in my living room for the HTPC/Gaming box there, so compact cards win big time there. This card is fast and cool and quiet. Drivers from nVidia these days are great, you can choose to just do the driver or the geforce experience, but HDMI scaling works perfectly even with HDCP enabled. This is why nVidia wins for me. I needed a good gaming card that doesn't make it a fuss to get good media playback (cough, Radeon software, cough). Overall great compact fast budgeting gaming 1080p GPU at the $200 price point!"

I can only go 4/5 because the current GPU market is overall overpriced. Another plus is the low power consumption of the 16 series, that can save some money in the long-term. Compared to other 16 series cards, the 1660 SUPER is clearly the best option... the 1660 Ti has minimally better performance (3-5%), and the 1660 performance is significantly lower (-10%) due to older GDDR5.

Gaming 5/5 - For 1080p, I consider the 1660 SUPER to be the sweet spot. You can easily play everything on high settings, and my guess is it will be this way for at least 2-3 more years before lowering settings is a regular necessity. 1660 SUPER is a passable option for 1440p and high framerate gaming, but 1080p is for the majority of gamers.

Noise 4/5 - The fan is audible with this TUF card, more than I've heard with previous cards I've owned (RX580, GTX470). It's not terribly loud, though... and with the low power consumption of the card, you really have to try pushing this card to get the fans revving up high.

This TUF GPU size is compact and should fit many cases. Sag shouldn't be a problem, unlike with larger cards.

I recommend the 1660 SUPER for 1080p gamers. If you're more casual and not focused on the newest games, maybe the 1650 SUPER or a used RX570-580 may be more within your budget."

It took me a long time and a bit of research to finally decide on this card, but ultimately I'm so glad I did.

This card is a beast at 1080p gaming and hasn't stuttered on anything that I've thrown at it. Overwatch, The Witcher III, Crash & Spyro Trilogy, MGSV, Batman Arkham Quadrilogy - all run buttery smooth at high graphic settings on this card coupled with a Ryzen 7 2700x. My PC runs whisper quiet with normal temps.

For the occasional gamer who's still running an older 1080p monitor, I can' t recommend this card enough."

I always believe that in a review should be about the product, because that's what we are reviewing and not the service received. That said, I was a little disappointed about the number of stickers stuck all over the box. Thankfully this doesn't affect the quality of the card.

The card is a really nice fit, and is smaller in size to what I am accustomed to. The card looks really nice, and is an ideal fit for any build as it is black in colour, so it will fit nicely in your case no matter your colour scheme. So far the card is performing pretty well, even though I haven't put it through any rigorous stress testing as yet. This I will do once the Sea Cables have been repaired and I am able to run at full performance without any other complications.

I chose this card based on affordability and specifications, and I am extremely impressed. I could have paid $100 - $200 more for a better GPU, but with my budget, this worked perfectly. After un-boxing and installing, I immediately went to benchmark (i.e. stress-test) this graphics card using Heaven Benchmark 4.0. Under high load, I get 60 frames per second, no stuttering, and an excellent quality of image. Next, I fired up my heavily modded Skyrim (300+ mods!) and the game runs like butter. So smooth, no stuttering, no image tearing whatsoever. Then, I loaded Star Wars: Fallen Order. Nothing but a smooth experience so far. I'm trying to find a negative aspect about this card, but since I've only had it for 24 hours, I can't find one(yet). There ARE better cards out there, but If you're looking to upgrade and you're on a budget, this graphics card is certainly top of it's class."

ASUSは0dBテクノロジーという静音機能を有しています．
これはGPUへの負荷が低い時（非ゲームプレイ時など）にファンを止めて静音化するというもので，いわゆるセミファンレスという機能に当たります（名称は違えど，各メーカーのグラフィックボードにも同じ仕様がありますね）．
問題は，このページに表示されている3つのモデルがどれもその機能を持っていない点です（ちなみに，DUAL-GTX1660S-O6G-MINIにはこの機能があります．なんでですかね？新しいモデルなんでしょうか）．

私は静音傾向のPCを組んでいますが，この機能がないため騒音が回避出来ません．
GPUファンの最低回転数は1100rpmもあるのです！静音仕様でもないファンをこの回転数で回せば駆動音はそれなりです．音楽を聴いたりゲームをしているときは気になりませんが，静かな環境でデスクワークをしているときは低周波のファン回転音が常に聞こえ，不快に感じるレベルです．

これを避ける術はもうありません．私は悩んだ末，同機能を有した別モデルを購入することに決めました．高い勉強代です．

GTX 1660Superは，ミドルクラスの定番GPUになると思います．ゲーミングにすべてのウェイトを置くというより，様々な用途にPCを使う上でゲームもしたいという方が購入層になると考えます．私の失敗が，せめて他の方の糧になることを祈ります．

GPUとしての機能には触れませんでしたが，自身の求めるレベルを見誤らなければ（すなわちハード性能以上のプレイングを求めなければ）不満を感じることはないと思います．"

However, there is a issue with windows 10 and Nvidia drivers. In Microsoft's endless wisdom they pushed out display drivers with their windows 10 updates. These drivers don't let you install the proper drivers for your card, leading to frantic googling and swearing. Turns out you have to download a 3rd party tool to remove the previous drivers to enable you to install your own. Once that is done it's smooth sailing, but buyer beware, do your homework"

1962,19.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,NVIDIA,24 GB,7000 MHz,$189.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,Not worth it !!,Performance is almost the same as RTX 2080Ti.

My 4 year old AMD r9 390x scored comparable to a brand new card. I'm running a zenith extreme motherboard with AMD 1950x , 64 GB ddr4 gskill , 1 tb Samsung 980 nvme... somethings wrong with this card . I'm checking through everything on my PC to make sure I didn't miss anything or need any bios update . Nope all good. The card is trash. Update . A few days after this the card must have cooked inside my PC as I smelled some burning electronics. Keep in mind my PC has 14 high pressure fans inside so I know it was not hot as my average temp was around 48c . That was usually hot inside the case because of a lot of rendering. Called Amazon for support and it was a insult talking to their rep as they told me that it must be the PC. Time to reboot it. Ok lol guess what. Tried a different setup with windows and it was the card. Next try . Amazon says we tried calling nvidia for ""help to you but they are close now"" great. I can tell I'm speaking to someone from scammer revolts YouTube now. End result. The card is dead. I'm sending it back to Amazon and I have unfortunately ordered a lower end card to replace this.

1966,19.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,NVIDIA,24 GB,7000 MHz,$189.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Great for Deep Learning, not gaming","This card really only makes sense to buy for one kind of person. The kind of person that needs more gpu memory. I work with huge deep learning models that even with a batch size of 1, still go over 12gb of gpu memory usage. So i was thrilled that this card was released. It is a bit disappointing to not be able to stack them together in one system due to cooling issues, but I'm happy none the less.

Please don't buy for gaming. SLI 2080ti's will work way better for the same price. And one 2080ti will give you about the same performance, but at half the price."
1967,19.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,NVIDIA,24 GB,7000 MHz,$189.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,"Great Card, not just for gaming though.","Initially I had wanted to buy two 2080 TIs as they came with 11 GB of VRAM and would be twice as fast as their 1080 counter parts. When the RTX Titan came out, the 24 GB of VRAM caught my eye and knew it was the card for me. When i got the card, it took me an hour or so to get it working with it's slower brother, the 1080, but once I started playing around, it did not disappoint.

My iray renderings come out much quicker, twice as fast as before. I'm getting double the framerate on every game i play- the card is so powerful that all games just go to maximum.

While it's a little expensive, the card performs very well, it being hooked up to two monitors while my 1080 is connected to four, giving me six total. The only major draw back on this card, which can be negated by tuning the fan profile, is the heat. I had to use third party software to crank the fans up to near maximum when the card is under full load.

Other than that, i've maxed the card out once with a single iray scene. Other than that, it's a solid buy.

EDIT/UPDATE: So I've been using this card for almost a year; games, CAD, Daz Renderings. It's a solid card at 24 GB of RAM and i've managed to max it out several times on RAM. it's a champ to say the least. I managed to render 5 different 300 DPI 6 x 9 images in 5 hours - simultaneously.

I definitely plan on getting a second card when the wallet allows. Please note the card's speed drops 200 mhz when it breaches 84 Celsius. a custom curve in MSI afterburner keeps it at 84 c or just under.

If you purchase this card- there will be a delay for funds verification. so that 2 day becomes 3 or 4. Signature required. As for gaming- it utilizes about 1/5 of it's total processing power to deliver (I cap at 60 fps)."

1969,19.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,NVIDIA,24 GB,7000 MHz,$189.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,Great Performance; Very Expensive,"Hands down a powerful beast for a consumer card. Handles pretty much anything thrown at in like a champ. The 24GB VRAM helps a lot for rendering and high use applications (of which I almost exceeded at one point). There is some coil whine when under heavy stress, but I noticed it actually got quieter the more I used it. Fans are decently quiet and you can keep it under 84C it in most applications. Price tag is mighty hefty and is definitely overprice by at least $500, but the performance is there."
1970,19.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,NVIDIA,24 GB,7000 MHz,$189.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,I like the NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card.,"I hope to purchase a second soon, if I need it. I am using this card on both Windows 10 and Intel Clear Linux OS, and using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers on both. Intention is to code both for machine learning and RTX. I have tested it lightly on some games, and it appears to be an impressive improvement over my older model 1080 Ti. I did not buy the Titan RTX primarily for gaming. My rating for value for money is not scientific, but a seat-of-the-pants feeling, for how it cmpares to my 1080 TI experience. This is an expensive card with lots of memory that is useful for neural networks and compute shader algorithms, but it is an entry-level platform in this respect. You can double this with two Titan RTX, for 48 GB, but before you think that is a lot, look at the NVIDIA site for full-on solutions that cost much more. One thing to consider is that the twin blower fans pull air from one side, and exhaust top and bottom through a heat sink running the length of the card--these do not exhaust out of the backplane like a commodity gaming rig does, they exhaust internally on most cases. This means that you need to consider your chassis cooling design differently, especially if you plan to use two cards. I like the design, it is actually more flexible. Use an appropriate chassis, maybe not your old GForce GTX chassis. My ambient room temperature is 75 F degrees, and I have six fans exhausting from a 6U case with lots of room around my single card, which is on a Thermaltake 16x riser. The card is cool to the touch while writing this review, and warm for the 3D I have tried so far. Hope this helps someone, ok, now I must get back to work!"

No game manufacturer is going to waste time targeting this card's resources.

This card is for deep learning and maybe other sci/tech applications. It's not even good value for mining crypto. Almost the only reason to get this card is to fit a large model (probably a neural net) into its spacious 24GB of vram, and for that purpose it works fine.

Don't think of it as an RTX card. Don't think of it as a Titan card. Think of it as a Quadro 6000 with the 64-bit flops disabled. Because that's what it is."

I swapped my healthy and working 1080 ti for this and you can configure your work to make use of the extra memory to increase your batch size with great reduction on your total training time and if you use software that uses the special 576 tensor cores this card is more than double the power than 1080ti when used for ai

It's excellent. Rendering under 70 celcius now. I am about to run two of these and a 1080ti on top of the stack. Card is amazing. Make sure you have good airflow and you will be fine.

Old review:
The only downside I have with my card is how hot it gets. When I rendering a 4k image in Maya using redshift, it gets up to 86 celcius real fast. It sits above my 1080ti which j am replacing with a titan V, which actually has the exhaust fan this card needs. For some reason they used the two fan method, which keeps the heat in the case. I have an excellent air cooled system, but this sucker gets hot. If only they made it with the 1 exhaust fan, it would be perfect.

Redshift render posted it's stats against all the other cards on their website... This one came out on top with the titan V following just behind it. I would be pleased if I could run two of these but there is no way with that amount of heat that two could run in the same case."

Just download NVIDIA GeForce Experience to auto detect the card and get the latest driver. But before doing so, here’s the trick — be sure to install the WLAN feature in the Server control panel. For some reason GeForce Experience requires the Wireless LAN feature or else it will crash upon startup. WLAN is included by default on other Windows editions but not on Server edition.

If you're rolling in dough, absolutely worth the purchase, but if you're trying to pinch pennies and save everywhere you can, you have to figure out of a 15% boost is good for you, otherwise it'd be CHEAPER to SLI/NVLINK 2 RTX 2080 Ti together, and get even more performance... But then you have to deal with frame lag and how many games don't have proper SLI support, so if you want the best single performance gaming card in history, right now, this is it."

I normally buy EVGA video cards, but their 2060 cards didn't have my preferred cooler style (blower with exhaust out the back of the case) and they all had fewer or legacy outputs which I was trying to avoid. So this card seemed like it was a good option. I've had Asus cards in the past which were ok and I stand by their motherboards, so I figured it was a pretty safe choice. Unfortunately this card's (thermal) performance was simply unacceptable.

I installed this card into a brand new PC I was building, with adequate cooling and power, but no matter what, with stock settings, the card would overheat and lock up the machine within few minutes of starting a game. I played around with the fan profile in the provided Asus GPU Tweak II software and was able to get the card to run stable for longer, but even that would eventually result in a lock up. The only thing which seemed to remedy this was setting the blower to run at 100% all the time (which sounds a bit like a hair dryer).

I don't overclock, I prefer simplicity and stability to the constant tinkering required to get every last ounce out of my hardware. When I plug in a video card, I expect it to work with stock settings. This card failed to do that. Whether it's a manufacturing defect or some bad firmware resulting in a broken default fan profile, I'm not sure. Honestly, I paid too much for this card to want to find out. I've returned it and ordered an EVGA card, hopefully that'll perform better despite the less desirable cooler and port configuration."

The only time i found any issues was in battle field 5 when i turned DXR on for shits a giggles. It ran surprisingly smooth every where but the city and even then it was only at the start of the map. The actual game play wasn't effected.

As far as noise goes i've had a dual fan gtx 660 and a dual fan rx 580 both louder than this card even when it ramps up. i had to open the side case to make sure the fan was running. This is my first blower style card and i always hear they have noise issues but it's the quietest video card I've had in years.

Far as price per pound this thing seems to be neck and neck with a 1070 and those are another 100-200$ new so i guess it's in good shape. It's still a little pricey to me but I don't regret my purchase.

Edit: So I’ve ran into an issue with the card. It’s got a loud tick in the fan. It happened during installation but I thought it was paper but it came back. Louder then ever with a vengeance. Took it out and noticed some of the screw heads have tool marks on them. I hope they didn’t send me a refurbished one at full price. I’ll have to go to the manufacture now that it’s past amazons lemon period. Awe well I still don’t regret the purchase but I’m very disappointed."

The ASUS Turbo series fit the bill with blower-style cards and I was able to get a 2060 for a decent price. Installation was a breeze and the card has been running all my games on the highest settings without any temperature issues. The card peaked at 74 degrees celsius and held there after several hours of gameplay. The card is louder than I would have wanted, but given the type of small case build I did, I will accept a little more noise when gaming as long as it keeps itself cool.

So after getting my windows up to date and correctly installing the drivers. I was only able to get about 4 hours of gaming right before artifacts started to appear on the graphic card. Thankfully it was under the 30 day Amazon return policy so I was able to return it and guess who decides to email me attempting to offer the most basic methods anyone would assume could of been the problem knowing how to build computers correctly.

I purchased the 1060 the other the other night at 10 pm and received it the very next day at about 3 pm. i was so surprised at how fast it got here. but anyways, installing was a bit tricky for me since i have never installed anything before, but the manual is very straight forward and there are plenty of videos on YouTube to figure it out. the hardest part about my installation was installing the 500w power supply i had also bought for my PC. I installed both of these upgrades into my Acer Aspire ATC-780A-UR12. i bought this PC a little over a year ago for just $500 and have used it to stream my gaming addictions and do school work on. I would also recommend this product. Before installed the new graphics card i would only get about 30 fps on games including Overwatch, CSGO, Apex Legends, Fortnite, etc (ON LOW SETTINGS) and everything turned OFF. After installing the graphics card, i hopped on Overwatch and noticed an immediate change, it changed my settings automatically and i was playing on ultra settings at almost 120 FPS. I then tested CSGO, and was playing at 220-260 FPS! This was absolutely mind blowing to me that this graphics card helped my PC this much. Honestly i think my PC is quieter now and usually when i check my CPU in task manager it is almost maxed out at all times, but it was running at 10-20% after the GTX 1060 was put in. I am so happy i purchased this item and cannot even recommend this product more for anybody who doesn't want to spend more than $300 on a card. This card does more than enough in my opinion, but i guess anything better than 30 fps would have made me happy. i have a total of $750 in my current gaming PC and couldn't be happier!

Oh i did run into one issue after booting up my PC. i tried to download the software off of the NVIDIA website and was having issues with my download, it would say that i couldn't download due to my task scheduler not running - this is an easy fix, just watch a YouTube video on it if it happens to you. (this was just an issue with my PC i believe)

other than that this is a great product and especially for the price! 5 stars from me (;"

After I received the card I installed it into my PC the next day. The card was great, until it wasn't. The day after I installed the card, I booted up my PC and the card was then disabled by my PC. I tried everything from rolling back drivers, making sure all the cables were connected, made sure it was in the slot properly, nothing was working. I then went to Asus to fill out an RMA form, only to find out that this card had been previously RMA'd. The card that I had received had already been returned as faulty, EVEN THOUGH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CARD ONLY SAID THE MANUAL WOULD BE MISSING. NOT THAT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY FAULTY. Upset by the lack of Amazon's knowledge on the card being previously faulty. The card was great for the day that it did last though, was great to play games for a few hours on settings/frames I haven't experienced before."

The display is superb, no lag, and the 2017 monitor stays on the chosen input (PC - HDMI 1) even after power cycle on monitor or PC using power saver to shut of monitor. Highly recommended.

I did have to trim the locking tab that holds the pcie cards in place because of the gpu's fan shroud, but it's plastic so easy with scissors. It's a tight fit too, so you have to slide it in at an angle to clear then line it up with the pcie slot and case holes (takes up two spots). Also recommend keep clear the slot below the fans blades. Due to where they put the sata and USB 3.0 connections on the motherboard for my other computer (Dell 9010 MT) this card wouldn't fit down into it, so I had to get a shorter GPU (EVGA GTX 1060 6GB mini) for it."

Came in a standard brown box. The GPU box has a box inside of it which seems very high quality for cardboard. I was presented with superior packaging from ASUS and was not let down by the contents inside. I've purchased a GTX 1060 6GB and a GTX 1050 from EVGA and their packaging is super thin and flimsy compared to what I just ordered. Runs everything great!

I'm proud to add this gpu box to my collection.

Average for 1060 is 8793, while average for 1070 is 11,017. I selected this one mainly because of the white cover, which ultimately is silly and unimportant.

Games run pretty much at full detail or even ultra on some, though the memory limitation of 3GB does get in the way more than I expected. Prey, for instance, can deliver 120 FPS, but stutters due to memory usage as new textures load in, making ""Medium Texture"" quality the only acceptable choice - purely a memory issue preventing using higher.

3D applications like Lightwave, Daz 3D, perform well enough, though, the memory limit again reduced effectiveness.

When I got a VR headset I was able to connect it (rift s) and worked well. Without its software doesn't work that well, but once I downloaded and got it installed, it was an easy setup. Don't search for drivers that specifically work with it but instead you should download Nvidia's GeForce experience app. It's a pain updating its drivers otherwise.

I have been using this for 5760x1080 surround gaming across three monitors for a couple weeks now and it's working wonderfully. No screen tear, no noticeable frame rate drops. I've been playing Battlefront, The Crew, Need For Speed, Borderlands: The PreSequel, and a couple other games that support ultra wide resolutions and it's been keeping up no problem. Great card, if it supported SLI I would buy another.

I just upgraded to this from an XFX Radeon 7870 and the difference this card makes blew me away. My old xfx was really struggling to keep up on games like Battlefront, fallout 4, and Doom, but this card takes all these games without breaking a sweat. I can now play anything I want on the highest graphics settings at 1080p resolution all day long and this card doesn't even flinch. No framerate drops, no screen tear, nothing.

A FurMark test on both cards was really interesting. The xfx hit 80 degrees C in under 45 seconds in the stress test and was only able to render around 40 fps. This Asus card rendered a constant 76 frames and took over 4 minutes to reach 80 degrees c. The ambient air temperature was around 19 degrees C when I ran this test. I am also personally not comfortable with any of my chips getting over 80 degrees C, so that is where I stop the tests. I know that most chips can go hotter without failing, but I am just not comfortable risking it due to my limited computer budget (hence the $200 card).

Please note that I only have 1080p monitors, and I don't plan on upgrading for a while. This card is perfect for 1080p gaming though, and if you're in the same 1080p/budget boat as I am this card is going to last you through quite a few games yet to come on ultra with very good frame rates."

I do suggest changing text size individually in Windows (menu size, etc.) individually. That way the fonts are large enough on screen and the graphics performance is still great. Very pleased that it's not heating up due to it's design - if it did, you would hear the fan which I would not be happy with. Really pleased with price and performance for what I'm using it.

It will deliver insane game play no shutter no lag much smoother than 2080 super but I was expecting higher bench speeds which I am not. It's same size as 2080 same looks has essentially better game play and about 100 bucks more than what I paid for my 2080 super. Final thoughts keep my 2080 don't buy this as its not hardly a game changer. It reacts well to drivers with little to no issue. Seems to have better response and eye candy. But the trade off at that price I'm not sure is a deal breaker. It won't fail you on insane playing without lag on ultra and runs cooler. Only main difference and all I do for a living is build gaming machines. Not sold on this card yet. Will play cyber punk a bit longer to notice any anomalies. But if your looking to spend alot of money for zero lag and crisp clean smooth gaming its the card for you needs more RAM and a Bump on clock speeds for this price.

My 2080 used actually costs more on Amazon. So maybe if you were in market for card during these times get this over the 2080. Seems like it's available now.

Beware no magic here just flawless gaming eye candy without shutter or lag and slightly less for price of a used 2080.

Will keep it this will future proof my 4,500 dollar PC. My 2080 now sits in a box unused."

i7-9700k H100i Cooling
32GB DDR4 RAM
Z390 AORUS Ultra MB
850W Corsair PSU

Monitor: Asus PG278q 27"" 144hz

Upgrading from a GTX 1080ti there was a substantial difference in speed and performance. Steady 120-144 fps on most AAA titles and games including but not limiting too: Apex Legends, COD:MW, WoW: SL, GTAV
Plan on testing RDR2 as that was unplayable with my GTX1080ti

I've been playing Cyberpunk 2077 and let the game detect default settings. Ultra/High on all settings. I can achieve an average of 60-90 frames depending on where I am and what I am doing. The game itself has bugs and glitches but overall looks gorgeous. RTX works fine with mirrors etc.

The hottest my card has been with a 50% fan curve is 56°

My biggest gripe is how is how lucky I am to have ordered it through a true retailer instead of a scalper charging double the price. Why are they even listing on Amazon? They should be removed like the resellers who tried to scalp necessities during the initial craze of Covid earlier this year.

Card is amazing, wish it wasn't a unicorn."

 Apparently you don’t always get what you pay for and the Linkup PCIe 4.0 riser cable is a great example of that. I paid upwards of $70 for this thing and expected it would be good and essentially perform the one basic thing that it’s designed for without dropping frames. In my experience, a high price point usually indicates exceptional material and quality assurance. In this case, it absolutely did not.

I read some of the bad reviews and should have listened, but I figured they were probably talking about the budget line of cables, not the premium one I was looking at. It’s hard to tell since they’re all grouped together on the same page. One more selling point was that my mobo has 2 PCIe 4.0 ports on it so I figured I’d go the future proof route and this item is sadly it right now if that’s what you’re trying to accomplish.

Immediately after connecting this thing to my RDX 2080 ti and plugging it into my Prime X570 Pro motherboard, I experienced boot issues and the fan on my graphics card ran constantly at full speed, then BIOS would try to load, the error light on the mobo indicated an issue with the graphics card, boot would fail, then the system would reload and repeat the cycle until a reset screen appeared from too many failed attempts. After the reset screen, I could get to Windows without making any actual changes in BIOS. Windows took significantly longer to load than normal and crashed sporadically while running. Every time I would reboot, I would have to do the same thing. I tried removing and reinserting the riser firmly. It doesn’t really lock in place on the motherboard (which felt cheap) so I thought maybe it wasn’t seated correctly. I tried reseating it and using multiple ports - nothing helped.

I have read some cables aren’t well shielded and thought maybe that was the source of the issue. To test this theory, I wrapped the entire cable in anti static shielding plastic four times over and from terminal to terminal - absolutely no change.

The second I took the riser cable out of the situation, everything went back to working flawlessly. I seriously hope this thing didn’t damage any of the components of my rig. I thought I could trust it because I paid enough to expect a good quality cable. Save yourself a few hours of wasted time and potential damage to your rig and look elsewhere. At least to me, it’s not worth the risk and this thing is getting returned first thing in the morning. Lesson learned: never buy a Linkup brand cable again."

This is the only pcie extension cable that works perfectly for my HighPoint SSD7101A-1 RAID Controller which is needed to be placed outside of the HP Server due to limited space and heat problems. Having been trying many similar cables from other sellers, none of those can be used to extend this highpoint NVMe SSD RAID controller. Other PCIe riser cables may be good for graphic cards which automatically lower the bandwidth to adapter slower performance cables, but total failed to run extreme high-speed data transfer as in our case. This Extreme PCIE cable does the job without sacrifice the performance and runs steadily for more than a couple of weeks (others fail within hours). It completely solves the heat and performance problem we had. Best performance cable. Will definitely recommended for whoever wants the performance."

However, it can absolutely hinder them.

That said, I saw zero framerate drop between cabled and my 2080 (non-ti version) plugged straight into the motherboard. I ran multiple benchmarks (3DMark, in-game, etc) with and without, and differences were within margin of error.

I did notice about a 4-6C drop, under load, in temps on the card, and about 2C drop on the CPU, due simply to the fact that the card was off and away from the motherboard. These temps are with the case side-door open (more on that below).

Cable seems very high quality, and was sufficiently long (actually just a bit TOO long) for a standard mid-tower case. Kind of wish there were color options other than just grey, as a vertically mounted GPU on a showcase PC is sexy, but kinda let down by the bland cable. I think CableMods exists because I'm not the only one who cares about aesthetics to the point of custom-coloring our ATX cables.

Sadly, the ASUS ROG Strix 2080 I bought is a 2.75 slot card, and is just too thick to mount vertically in my Corsair 500D case. It gives me about a 1/4inch gap if I close the case door, and then the temps just skyrocket. I used it instead in my old case with my old 980ti, which seems to get enough airflow; dropping temps by a few degrees even with the door closed.

Good product, despite me not checking if I could properly fit my GPU vertically. Hopefully one of you learns from my oversight."

This went perfectly with it. Compared to Thermaltake this has much better shielding and I noticed no performance drop between the two.

I wish they would find a way to do a single cable or tubes versus flat though as long ribbon cables are notoriously a nightmare for cable management and them splitting this into multiple small ribbon cables makes it a mess.

Overall pick this one over if you're worried about electrical noise and shielding. Durability is great, I can see these lasting a while as well. This cable is futureproof too and should be able to handle new standards within the next 5-10 years easily."

Very thick but this is great if you need heavily shielded. I was able to twist these cables to get fit into a half height slot, and they worked fantastically (most cables did not). These babies are expensive, but well, well, well worth the price. No other cable that I twisted was able to fit through a half-height slot and continued to work. NO LOSS OF SIGNAL, and can be twisted any way you want! Best of both worlds. I literally spent $100 on cheap cables and after a while they resulted in a system halt due to PCIe signal fault. I had to throw them out. I am using a souped up 256GB 82TB RAID 6 SuperMicro Dual E5-2697 v2 48 cores. The case is only 2U and thus only has half height slots. ALL OF THE OTHER CABLES REQUIRED TWSITING OR CRIMPING TO FIT IN THE 2U SLOT ON THE CASE! This is why they failed, If you see the pictures, these cable DO NOT use ribbon cables, these are individual wires that are shielded and divided. This way you can navigate these cables to fit into very tight spaces. MOREOVER, and this is the best part.... NO SIGNAL LOSS. Moreover they do not obstruct the adjacent PCIe lanes. If you look at the supermicro X9dri-ln4f MOBO you get alot of PCIe slots, but he space is very, very tight, especially in a 2u case. Yeah they aren't cheap, but you better believe they are worth every damn penny, especially if you had to go through wasting the time, energy, money and suffering the frustrations all the other cables caused me."

The LinkUP support said they are making a new PCB to address the issues of PCB deflection and length in some Phanteks cases. They also said they would send an engineering sample to test once it was produced. I will post the results on this review including photos and performance test information.

Attached are a few photos showing the Phanteks riser cable and 90 degree mounts (PH-VGPUKT_02 & Enthoo 719 case mount) As you can see the printed circuit board (PCB) is a lot smaller (length and width) and deflects (bends) under the weight of heavy graphics cards. Note: The Phantks doesn't.

LinkUp product quality:
It is a very nice cable. The cable quality is good. The connectors are nice and well constructed. If the PCB was like the Phanteks one (thick and larger) it would be 5 stars (currently, I would say 3 stars since it doesn't as good as Thermaltake or Phanteks)

Support:
They can be a little hard to get hold of in the US. But once they engage they have been very good to work with and have accepted the product return even though it was open.

The riser cable does well as expected - card works well when vertically mounted (get a little warmer than usual, but nothing crazy). The part that plugs into the GPU does not reach the mounting holes in the sekira case, can't fault the riser cable for that, but I did have to rig something in my case in order to help support the gpu.
My main issue with this riser cable is that I had an internal audio card (Sound Blaster AE-5) and while the gpu was vertically mounted the cable would interfere with the audio card. I would get weird wobbles in audio playback tests - and spikes in chatter. I then tried an external sound card - same problems. All of these problems disappeared when I mounted the card normally. I'm going to have to return this cable and try a different brand, or give up the vertically mounted dream."

Nachdem ich über die letzten Monate hinweg im Kontakt mit dem Hersteller stand, mir diverse Engineering Samples zum Testen zur Verfügung gestellt hat, kann ich sagen, dass ich mittlerweile die finale Revision 2.0 des Riser Kabels in Händen halte. Mit diesem Kabel treten nach bisherigen Tests keinerlei Fehler mehr auf, weder in synthetischen Benchmarks noch in Spielen, auch die WHEA Fehler sind behoben!

Diese neue Kabel-Revision sollte laut Hersteller ab Mitte Februar 2020 im Einzelhandel verfügbar sein.

Ich möchte ausdrücklich noch einmal hervor heben, wie zufrieden ich mit dem Support und Service des Herstellers bin, und dass man schlussendlich eine gemeinsame Lösung gefunden hat, die allen zugute kommt! Würde die Bewertung somit auf die vollen 5 Sterne anheben.

---

Ich habe drei verschiedene Riser Kabel dieses Herstellers probiert: Das 15cm Premium, das 20cm Premium und das 30cm Extreme.

Kein einziges dieser Riser Kabel funktionierte auf einem ASUS Strix X570-E mit einer PowerColor 5700XT Red Devil ohne Probleme, trotz Herstellerangaben ""PCIe 4.0 Ready"" (bei den Premium Varianten) oder ""PCIe 4.0 Verified"" (Extreme Variante).

Bereits nach Windows Start finden sich Tausende WHEA Error ID 17 Fehler (= Fehler im PCI Express Root) im Ereignisprotokoll. Sobald Last anliegt bricht die Performance auf PCIe 1.1 ein, der Rechner startet direkt neu oder es hagelt BlueScreens.

Die Verarbeitungs-Qualität der Riser-Kabel ist hochwertig und mit PCIe 3.0 mögen die Kabel tatsächlich gut funktionieren, aber die Angabe bezüglich PCIe 4.0 ist schlichtweg gelogen. Meine Suche nach PCIe 4.0 Riser Kabeln geht weiter."

Die beiden Anschluss-Slots sind in der Breite kleiner als die anderen, welche ich bis jetzt hatte.
Damit konnte ich das Ding durch die Slot-Öffnungen des Gehäuses schieben um dann die GPU nach aussen zu verlegen.
Bis jetzt fehelrfreie Übertragung an die angeschlossene NVIDIA Quadro GV100, welche mit 97% Auslastung läuft.
Das eine der 5 Bänder/Kabeln berührt, im PC-Gehäuse, eine weitere sehr heiss werdenden GPU und ich kann da keine Beschädigung durch Wärmeeinwirkung feststellen. Wohl wegen des Materials, dass nicht schmilzt -- was bei den anderen, preiswerteren, Stoff- bzw. Gewebe-Bänder der Fall war.
Knicken geht nicht, aber enges Biegen ist sehr gut möglich.
Der Sperrhebel auf der Buchsenseite rastet an die GPU gut ein - auf der Steckerseite aufs Board auch sehr gut.
NACHTEIL: Sehr bzw. zu teuer (speziell die längeren Ausführungen)!!
Dafür spitzen Verarbeitung und sieht auch gut aus.

It looses 1/2 star for having a fan (NVS-290 was fanless), but stars
round down.

Honestly, I can't hear the fan, and the card is still pretty low power
(less than 20W), but I hate fans.

The old card still works perfectly but is no longer supported by
current NVidia drivers. It is still supported by the actively
maintained NVidia legacy driver, but the legacy driver prevents you
from upgraded to the current version of Xorg X11 server (which, in
turn, prevents upgrading various other things to current versions).

So, I sadly have to retire the trusty NVS-290.

Additionally, this card is for the HP Small Form Factor workstations in the Z200 series.

The difference between what is shown in the image with this product and what I received is that the GFX card has two (non-standard [see image]) HDMI jacks although my new monitor (being an HP VH240a) came with the necessary cables. So this card is running a desktop with two monitors and it does it rapidly and seamlessly. I don't know whether or not it would be satisfactory for someone who is an intense gamer but for a computer engineer it is an elegant card with a very nice Dashboard for fine tuning both monitors (the second is an HP w2408h which is almost 10 years old) and this card is a major improvement over the motherboard's GPU. When I installed this card the older monitor's GFX definition was dramatically improved.

I am very happy with this card which I've been using since June 2019 and have no reservations in recommending this to other computer engineers or users who know how to install a card and use the CD to install the drivers, who want a very nice GFX card."

Installed in a Dell Inspiron 560 and a Dell Inspiron 3847 system. Worked fine until I thought I would try to flash it with UEFI GOP support. Don’t do that. You'll brick it if you do. If you need Secure Boot, look elsewhere. If you don't, then this was a decent card for the money. Drove all three displays on Windows 10 (while it lasted) with decent performance. Not meant for high-end gaming. Works best with clean installations of drivers. Requires an active adapter (not included) to use the DisplayPort at the same time as two HDMI displays. Otherwise you'll only get two working displays.

However, it does support O/S from Windows XP to Windows 10. Which is convenient in my case. Before an O/S reaches the end of its lifestyle,, I perform a clean install, including drivers, software, and naturally security updates. I create a system image. When I feel nostalgic, I just restore that image. Everything is intact. I grew tired of playing with Virtual Machine and its limitations.

I purchased two of these graphic cards, and both of the fans had an annoying wining sound. There is one thing that I have learned. Do not buy electronics, or computer parts from online store that doesn't concentrate on technology. What you see (advertised), is not always what you get (actual product) on this site.

I loaded the software from the disk that came with the device. That solved the two monitor recognition problem, but the display was only 90% of the screen. I tried to check the customer support page, It was blank and had not been updated on over a year. I did find the option in the supplied software to correct the 90% display issue. I thought I might be home free, until I tried to register the device to activate the three year warranty. If you guessed that the registration page is nonexistent, you would be right.

In the end, this is a disappointing card. I am going to return it.

But let me tell you

The GOOD:
- The card really manages to drive 3 screens (I had one DP and two HDMIs connected simultaneously) with very decent performance
- It fits inside my SFF desktop (DELL OptiPlex 960).
- Most importantly: It DOES support DDMA (in Windows at least), and is able to send independent audio streams to the two HDMI monitors. This was the very reason I purchased the card.

The BAD:
- The fan is really noisy. I tried using a Low-Noise-Adapter, and that did bring the noise levels down to almost acceptable. Still - not enough for a HTPC.

The UGLY:
- It crashes Windows 7 Pro systematically. After upgrading ATI Catalyst software to the latest version, Windows crashes every time I try Skype. Even if I don't use Skype, the machine seems to freeze every now and then without obvious reason. Was rock-solid before the addition of the VisionTek card.

This makes the card useless, so I'll have to return, alas!
I loved the idea of being able to drive a screen + 2 TVs simultaneously, but maybe this is not the card for it."

This is to inform purchasers of a potential additional step required when installing this graphics card. My computer, an HP Envy 700 (and possibly other computers) required a change in one BIOS setting before this card will work. I cannot post a link here, so to find a solution for your computer you'll need to do an internet search. Or, if you can find a knowledgeable person at VisionTek , they also may be able to help with this.

The card did not work at all before changing the BIOS setting. After I changed the setting it worked fine. It was easy for me (not a computer expert) to change the BIOS setting.

PROS:
- Fit like a charm in my HP Slimline.
- Got both HDMI ports hooked up and having no issues with multiple displays.
- Good for moderate gaming. Probably won't be able to handle some of the newer games unless you setup custom profiles in Catalyst.
- Handles rendering and intense GPU processing well. Tested with ptGui and AutoCADD so far. Got pretty good results, pretty quick.
- Came with ATX case bracket, HDMI to DVI-D converter and drivers / ATI Catalyst software and instructions.
- Rates at a 6.9 / 7.9 on Win7-64 with Phenom II X6 1065t CPU.

CONS:
- NOISY. Before I upgraded the video card I had about 17 - 20dB of noise from my system at idle. Now it's about 35dB - 38dB at idle. At 100% CPU usage it's about 55 - 60dB with case & CPU fan at full throttle with all case covers on. Pretty noisy.
- HOT. Hot to the touch. Granted you shouldn't be ""touching"" the heat sinks on your GPU card but even from an overnight OFF state to on, it gets hot quickly. Less than two minutes.

I'm being generous with the four star here because the heat and noise is almost a deal breaker. Hot and noisy just isn't a good combination for any type of electronics unless it's a device that is expected to produce heat and noise. The card itself works great though.

For the cooling benefits, a fan is a good thing to have on your GPU. For the noise, eh, not so much - especially the fan on this card. Might want to go with a silent card that just has larger heat sinks and hope your case fan (if you have one) keeps your system cool enough or replace the fan with a liquid cooler for GPU cards (if you have the space)."

Hardware wise this card has a GPU, but it's not one really designed for games. It's got enough power to do most basic things while driving four displays. That includes things like video encoding, decoding, and some 3D boosts. To be super clear this is NOT DESIGNED FOR GAMING, but for business use. And it does exceptionally well at doing that with most apps one would use for business (CAD software, editing, etc).

The only minor disappointment was that the GPU driver is apparently not versioned correctly (or possibly not strong enough?) to support enhancing zoom conferencing with virtual backgrounds. It may be that the hardware could support it, but Zoom doesn't see the version info it wants and simply refuses to try. Hopefully that will be corrected if it can at some point in the future."

2349,27.0,PNY NVIDIA Quadro NVS 510 2GB GDDR3 4-Mini DisplayPort Low Profile PCI-Express Video Card VCNVS510DVI-PB,PNY,NVIDIA,2 GB,12000 MHz,$184.24,4.5 out of 5 stars,Now I have 4 monitors,"I had gotten some monitors on the cheap and wanted to connect them to my 2012 Dell XPS desktop. Chose this card, and it is working great!!! I had an audio issue, and it was resolved in a couple of hours of email (1 email each way). Card works well. Displays are crisp. I don't have games running, so can't answer to the gaming people. For normal apps, the response time is fantastic."
2350,27.0,PNY NVIDIA Quadro NVS 510 2GB GDDR3 4-Mini DisplayPort Low Profile PCI-Express Video Card VCNVS510DVI-PB,PNY,NVIDIA,2 GB,12000 MHz,$184.24,4.5 out of 5 stars,Works great and is quiet...exactly what I wanted,"Let me say this up front - I am a software engineer, not a PC gamer, and this card is not for gaming. I wanted a desktop graphics solution to support multiple monitors, and this card fits the bill perfectly for me. I am currently powering three 24"" 1920x1200 DisplayPort monitors (may go to 4 eventually). The card is pretty quiet (more so than my PC case fans), and my PC has been stable since installing it (as expected). The only downside is price compared to a gaming card that would provide similar performance (for up to 3 monitors). But I wanted less heat and quieter operation, and I like the ease of connecting all of my monitors using DisplayPort with the option of a 4th monitor.

Pros: Works as advertised, 4 monitor support, includes min-DP adapters, runs quiet
Cons: Price"

Installation- quick and easy, with Windows 8 OS, the card automatically installed. I still had to load the Nvidia desktop program, but that was super easy as well.
Operations- I have 4 screens, (2) 27 inch planar monitors and (2) 24 inch Acer's. As soon as I make a profit trading I will upgrade to all 27 inch monitors, this video card can easily handle the resolution and speed requirements for trading.
Gaming- I have a PS3 for that, so I don't know

I've seen no performance issues, I've heard no annoying fan noises, the card just works right out the box."

Windows 10 recognized the driver right away and the fan is not too loud. It's audible with the case off, but not too bad and barely audible with the case closed."

Took a little fiddling to install -- because had to go to the Nvidia website (avoiding all the numerous other driver providers from whom U can get a driver -- but-- same comes w a plethora of junk adware & etc.) to get a driver. Since installed is working great with no smearing or other bothersome artifacts. Would buy again. Excellent for data streaming, You tube, & movies. Would have given it five stars except for having to look for a driver. Support called me back the following day of my contact with them."

The card works great and allows me to have up to 4 monitors running which works well for my needs. Could not be happier with the performance of the card.
2355,27.0,PNY NVIDIA Quadro NVS 510 2GB GDDR3 4-Mini DisplayPort Low Profile PCI-Express Video Card VCNVS510DVI-PB,PNY,NVIDIA,2 GB,12000 MHz,$184.24,4.5 out of 5 stars,NVS 510 Is a Good Replacement for the NVS 420,"I needed a second quad monitor card for another computer and looked at the NVS 420 I've used in other computers. The 420 has been discontinued. The 510 is significantly faster, slightly less expensive, and easier to install and connect. The 510 uses 4 mini display port connectors rather than the VHDCI connector on the older card. Mini display ports just seem a heck of a lot easier to connect. Card came with full height bracket installed and the short bracket if I needed it (I did). The 510 has 2 GB vs 512 MB of the 420, as well as 192 CUDA cores vs 16 in the 420,

Great business graphics card. Probably not what somebody would be looking for if gaming."

Only issue I have had is that it doesn't like to work with different monitors. I had several monitors that were different models from Dell, and the card wouldn't work with them. I switched them out to all the same monitor and it works all the time. I've had this issue before with other display port monitors and cards."
2357,27.0,PNY NVIDIA Quadro NVS 510 2GB GDDR3 4-Mini DisplayPort Low Profile PCI-Express Video Card VCNVS510DVI-PB,PNY,NVIDIA,2 GB,12000 MHz,$184.24,4.5 out of 5 stars,Great Video Card for Business Graphics,"Installation was a breeze and the driver provided was the most current available. We replaced two 5 year old nVidia gaming cards which were stating to become unstable. This installation simplified the computer layout, as no power cords to to PCI Express card were necessary and greatly increased internal space as the card design is low profile. Three days in the video is very stable and the primary user is able to control all video functions.

The only negative is that the card we ordered did not come with DisplayPort to DVI-D adapters despite showing their inclusion on the Amazon, PNY Web Site, and the card packaging. A call to PNY customer service was not productive as they said I ordered the wrong part number. We had to purchase new cables locally which added about $40 to the cost."

Worked flawlessly once I installed Windows 7. It took tech support a week to info me of that. But great card, even for AutoCAD and Inventor."

They do what I need them to. The only room for improvement is how the driver handles secondary monitors being turned off. I often have to re-adjust my settings.

I needed a multi monitor card that could support multiple 1440p displays. This card is exactly what I needed. I don't game, and the specs on this card don't look good for gaming, but for work, not design or artistic work, but document processing and many windows requiring much real estate, this is great.

I also ordered the minidisplayport to display port cables and they worked perfectly."

This card works fine as long as you do not touch it. The Mini Displayports on this card are either faulty, or Mini-Displayport technology itself is faulty. After about 4-6 months of usage, the video's begin to not work and go black. The problem is, if you slightly touch or bump the connection, it loses visual. We then spend time trying to resolve it, rebooting, re-plugging up everything. Eventually you can get your display back.. until you bump it again.

For the average home user, probably not an issue. For businesses who need 4-8 screens working 24/7 on critical computers, this is not a good product. Getting called at 2 am to come troubleshoot Faulty Graphic cards sucks. I Have reached out to PNY for RMA, and they have been helpful in working with me to resolve it. However, at this point, we do not want replacement cards. We would rather have our money back and go buy Quad cards that have Displayport or HDMI inputs. If we want to stay in the nVidia world and stay under $500 per card, that means rolling back nearly a decade to the NVS 450. Because this NVS 510 was the only Nvidia Card that had Quad capability on a low profile bracket.

This results in us looking back to ATI and their Cards for options. I sincerely hope and wish nVidia/PNY is able to craft working technology for Quad monitor users who do not want to troubleshoot this issue any further."

So far the only issue I've had is that it isn't a gaming video card. I can play games in standard definition, like WoW and such, but anything more than that and this won't really give me the quality I want. But, I got it to power my 4 DP monitors and it does beautifully. I wish it did have more memory since I believe it is the issues I can't play WoW in low resolution, watch Netflicks, and maybe short You-Tube videos from time to time. The video sync gets a second or two off, and/or stops and then runs real fast to catch up. My PC is normal for current times, 16GBs ram, i7 Proc, ETC. It is a Dell Optiplex so that could be it, but just playing a couple of video streams and some minor gaming shouldn't cause that much stuttering I wouldn't think."

The software is very tricky to do a custom install as the cards not able to recognize this monitored through the adapter You got a check two boxes to try to make custom settings, but that not clear form the screen. The Seiki documentation is terrible but the interlace mode would work but the settings could not be saved. Various calls to customer support or worthless. I had a very high level software engineer I could not get to work either. Had to return but did not use Amazon because they were out of stock and not sure what I am going to face.On the other hand, the included Nvidia desktop software is really nice and I have used it for four years. The fact that the card only takes 35 W is great.

Many other cards would do better performance, but not at this low of power consumption. Works great for our church computer, which only has a stock 400W power supply. The Displayport cables are pretty weird (Mac stuff) but adapters are available and it works. We have a quirk with one of the displays that are connected to an actual TV, if the TV is on BEFORE you start the computer, then all is fine. If you turn on the TV after the computer, then it doesn't ""wake up"" the port and you will have to reboot the computer. An annoyance for sure, but it works fine once you realize the workaround."

I'm perfectly capable of downloading one, but there's no point in putting a CD in the box when it only yields 'The Graphics Adapter installed in the system is not compatible with the current set of drivers.' Not to mention that paying $300 for a video card should command the respect of including the correct driver.

I ordered this card because we needed three displays and may expand to four. Once I downloaded the driver it worked fine--not amazing, just fine. I still see video artifacts now and then--periodically I'll close a window and it doesn't disappear until I 'mop' the screen with another window.

If it wasn't a requirement by the company to use these sub-standard cards, I would've said goodbye to them long ago and went with an ATI product.

Kind of a shame because I have had great performance from GeForce gaming cards on my personal machines, but these workstation grade cards are really eating into our productivity when they start dropping displays.

The NVS 510 was a great solution - compact and quiet, but supporting 4 high end screens. It does use mini-DP ports to fit a single slot but includes 4 adapters with clips to easily attach screens. I found and ordered one HDMI adapter from NewEgg for the TV connection. It might be cheaper to use an adapter cable. Now the TV signal is stable, the new screen is supported, and the unit runs cool.

To be honest, purchasing this board was something of an afterthought, since I figured bringing the desktop machine's RAM up to 4 Gb and installing a quad core processor should do the trick. But - having had good results with Diamond products in the past, and a modest price tag for the board, I opted to buy it and try it.
Upside: the card worked on the first try, and does a fine job of accelerating Zoom sessions.
Downside: the drivers from the AMD website installed with little drama, but there's a shortcut for settings that doesn't lead anywhere (Win 7). However, the Catalyst app allows the user to configure the board so I'm inclined to think the shortcut is just a leftover that was not removed prior to being assigned legacy status.
In any case - suits my needs to a tee. Recommended."

So, I decided to look for a video card that was ""not too old but not too new"" that would have Windows XP drivers and drivers that would at least work under Windows 10. I settled on this card, and I have not been disappointed. Installation of the card under Windows 10 with the supplied CD-ROM was straight forward and reasonably quick, and the same was true when installing the drivers on my Windows XP installation. I have thus far been able to run my Windows XP games (since they don't run under Windows 10) without a hitch, and the card functions well under Windows 10.

HDMI, check. Catalyst Control Center, check.","I bought this for a Dell Precision T7500 server workstation--an absolute behemoth of a tower. One criteria for this purchase was noise reduction. Internally, the Dell has all passive cooling for the CPU, North bridge and RAM (24 gigs) and I didn't want to run my TV at 20db while watching moves to compensate for droning fan noise. The role of the Dell monstrosity is to make a dumb TV a smart TV, while acting as a media gateway between my TV and the Network Storage unit housing my movies. This card is the perfect solution at an economic price, answering all of my needs and exceeding expectations, replacing the Nvidia NVS card that failed. For the record, the Dell is running Windows 10 pro X64 and the TV is a 46"" Dynex with 1080p HDMI. Crisp image quality with a minor adjustment to screen scaling through the Catalyst Control Center--something I usually don't install. If you're looking for a robust card, it's important to note Diamond makes top-rated stuff in the Radeon line. This card, even at GDDR3 is no exception."

And yes, it will support 5.1 audio (and if I remember correctly, 7.1 also although I have never felt need for a 7.1 audio setup so I can't verify that).
I don't do gaming, though clearly this card wasn't designed for that. It's for mostly for HTPC or multiple-monitor use, and works fine for that. No problems with sound, no problems with video artifacts or ghosting--just smooth output of sharp 1080p image for high-definition video from the Blu-Ray discs I play in my BD drive.
(Too bad there isn't an inexpensive software Blu-Ray player that not only plays the movie but also the supporting videos, trailers, etc.)

I bought this for gaming. I had a lot of games on Steam and such that I played on my old 6600GT. I then got a new PC and was stuck with onboard for a while. The card can run pretty much anything that's out right now, but for stuff like Crysis you might wanna run it at lower resolutions and with medium-high settings. It's obviously not an 8800GT but it gets the job more than done. No complaints. It got pretty hot the first day I used it but after that I didn't notice anything. *Knock on wood*

Monitor displays things with higher quality. Has PhysX support which is cool. I don't really know what else to say. It performs well enough. I ran Left 4 Dead at 60+ fps even with hoards at 1440x900, everything high except AA.

However....I think I learned a lesson. Others have made similar comments, but I had to learn by doing. The lesson is this: Don't expect this card to make your single-core econo-model PC into a game/graphics demon. It will make your display smoother and make it possible to run some graphic-intensive games. In the process, it will push the power supply to the max, and you'll discover other bottlenecks such as disc and memory i/o.

Now I can run most games on high settings and even new ones run well. Dragon Age Origins works very well on medium settings at full res for me 1440x900. The dual monitor feature is excellent too.

What this means is that any protected content (e.g., Blu-Ray, HD-DVD, Vista HD video, etc.) will not play through this card and you'll get a blank screen.

I called EVGA and they told me they had no idea, that's right ""no idea"" why it's not working. They told me to just get a new card, so I did. The new 8600gt didn't work at all, so I reinstalled my old card which has no problem, and returned the 8600gt. I'm fed up!

Light weight, cool running under loads, stable!","I built a video editing computer according to specs I read on a tech website. It called for both a Quadro K4000 GPU (not this K4200) and a GeForce GTX780. The idea was that the GeForce provided the superior rendering performance while the Quadro K4000 provided the stability and 10-bit processing for color adjustments and grading. The Quadro is the recommended board by Adobe for serious editing work.To be honest, I saw no difference whether the Quadro was installed or not, but it's impossible to tell what's really going on under the hood.

I became concerned because someone at PNY told me that they did not recommend nor support the two GPUs be installed in that configuration. I returned the K4000 because I could not justify the price tag for no discernible results.

Then, I decided to build another computer for a different purpose and at the time this Quadro K4200 was released. I must say that both the Quadro K4000 and the K4200 perform well. Unlike the GTX780, the Quadro is much smaller, lighter, and stays cooler under loads. Its size and weight helps because I'm building a portable system. And of course I prefer the 1 GB increase in VRAM over the K4000."

The first one I returned, this one I should return. They ran for a only two days under long load before they caused my PC to freeze. In other words, I tried two different cards in three different Dell work stations and after a day or so they freeze the computers after about 40 minutes of GPU run time. I would restart the computer and the system would freeze again 30 or 40 minutes later. I spoke to PNY and they have no explanation or suggestions as to why this happens. I think it is a design flaw in the K4200 and would not recommend them to anyone that has long projects. They just freeze the computer and once in a while cause errors on the hard drives. My drives are mirrored so just a bit of recovery time lost and of course the project. If your drives aren't mirrored, you may be down for some time. What good is a card that freezes your computer after 40 minutes? I have run a pair of K2200, K620, a GTX 980, and a GTX 960 in these systems on with the same work load for weeks without any problems. I monitor temperature and they were well within operating range. The GPU load was 50-60%. No obvious reason to fail. They just do not seem to run long.

The first k4200 that I purchased would run for about 30 minutes before freezing my work station. As long as I was not using the GPU, it would work fine. But, when ran the GPU circuits for 10-30 minutes, zap, black screen. I spent an hour on the phone to PNY trying to find out what is going on. Tried it in different work stations, T5500 and 2 different T3500s. Same problem. No ideas from PNY. So I returned it to Amazon. (Amazon return was great!) A few weeks later I decided to give another K4200 a try. It ran for 36 hours before freezing the work station just like the previous unit. I may send this new card back too."

Premessa, visto il prezzo pagato, mi aspetto tutto sia perfetto come minimo. Ma veniamo al test, appena montata scheda tutto va bene, RGB colorazione arcobaleno all'accensione, scarico il software dedicato per settare colorazione fissa in linea a tutti i componenti RGB del mio pc e magia... NON E' ANCORA OTTIMIZZATO IL SOFTWARE PER POTER REGOLARE RGB DI QUESTA SCHEDA!.
Scrivo all'assistenza PNY e dalla Francia mi rispondono che sono a conoscenza del problema e ci stanno lavorando per risolverlo senza avere una tempistica per la risoluzione.
Scusatemi ma una domanda me la pongo. Prima di lanciare un prodotto sul mercato qualcuno se l'era fatta la domanda su come controllare i led RGB?????
In soldoni avrei dovuto accettare di tenermela con colorazione arcobaleno continua oppure staccare cavo RGB per non avere illuminazione sulla scheda e non avere RGB accesi.
Se pago un prezzo premium per un prodotto di fascia enthusiast mi aspetto tutto sia perfetto e considerando ho un pc desktop di fascia alta in tutti i suoi componenti con case finestrato per godermi anche il lato estetico non accetto un compromesso del genere e mi stupisco di questa superficialità da un'azienda come PNY.
PNY mi spiace ma prima volta che ti compro ed anche ultima. Reso avviato. Grazie ad Amazon per la celere consegna ma spero la prossima RTX 3090 in arrivo, di altro brand ovviamente, non mi faccia scherzi."

It does not have RTX but who care really, when you can play most modern games at 1080p in ultra detail, or in 4K at high or ultra.

It does heat up quite a lot, and noise level is pretty considerable, but overall it is still bearable if your case is a good case with decent insulation and good exhaust fans.

Not a single game is dropping below 60 fps in 4K, and with some games I get more than 100 fps on average; no stuttering, no issues whatsoever.

Save some money and get the previous gen; RTX is still new technology that is barely used in games, and in some new games like control, turning RTX on does drop about 10 frames per second, so there is still a lot to do to get real time rendering in games. In the meantime, this card will serve you well."

It also looked great in my system.
However, I immediately heard a noise when the fans kicked on. I tried to duplicate it off of the computer with no luck but I did notice, when mounted, the power wire to the fan would hang just enough for the blades to rub against it.
The bitter outweighed the sweet on this one. For as much as this card costs, it shouldn't make much noise if any at all since there are no bearings in the fans. The photos show the blades wearing through the insulation of the wire and the blades themselves being blasted down. Eventually leading to overheating or possibly a fire.
This little problem slipped by QA. Now I've been waiting a few days for the return to process, after it's been delivered. This I can't completely hold fault to them due to Covid.
I can imagine this must've been just a slip up, but noteworthy nonetheless."

I acquired a second 27"" monitor and needed a card that could drive 2 monitors using DisplayPort and after a search, found this little and light video card.

There are lots of cards out there that support two monitors at that resolution but they require a higher wattage power supply than I had in my computer. This card requires very little power so worked perfect for me. I don't think this card is made for gaming but if you want one for general use that doesn't require the purchase of an upgraded power supply this one works great.

If you need to fit this in the short slots, you might want to keep looking.

Myself, I'm not afraid to get creative when I need it now. I took tin snips to the one that came with it and made it shorter, then folded it and used a drill and rat tail file to make it fit. Just make sure you remove it from the card itself before you do something like that to avoid damage. Worked just fine after I tweaked it to fit."

I had heard that DVI and VGA were comparable in that they drew power from the computer, or something like that. I wanted a card with two HDMI ports and that's how I ran across this card.
When I bought this one I thought it was two HMDI. When I realized it was two Display Ports, I bought two inexpensive DP to HDMI cables. (These are one-way cables from the card to the monitors.) I installed the card, plugged in my new cables, and got it set up.

I contacted the seller with the issue and he called me back within 30 minutes but I got it working by that point."

According to [...] the NVS 310 is the way to go.

I use windows server 2008R2 which is basically Windows 7 compatible, so I gave it a go:

I installed this guy and then needed to:
1. alter BIOS to re-enable integrated graphics
2. install Nvidia Graphics Driver 311.44. (It took a couple of driver downloads and a bit of fiddling. in the end, completely uninstalling all NVidia drivers, then doing a custom-install with 311.44 and deselecting everything but the core driver was the way to go).
3. windows screen management then worked fine.

I'm now a happy camper with 4 screens (3xdisplay port + 1xDVI). No idea about its graphics performance, but for coding etc it does exactly what I wanted."

Dell's resolution was to send a HDMI to VGA adapter which has a pretty poor picture. This Video card will set both monitors to Display port and they will hopefully match in quality of picture. Thank you Dan for all your help with this issue. If this adapter works properly, I will probably need some additional adapters and Ken's Computer will be my vendor of choice."

Otherwise, this is a quality video card for business applications."

It did not come with the full height adaptor as pictured that it came with both.. The half adaptor that came on it was bent badly... And the fan on the card itself had dust packed in it like it had been in a pc for QUITE SOME TIME.

If it works whatever.. But is is NOT LIKE NEW and should NOT OF BEEN marketed as such. At least blow the dust out of the fan and straighten it out GOOD LORD."

I was under the impression I could have 3 screens on this card using Displayport 1.2 technology to daisychain a 3rd screen. Turns out that you can do that, but the GPU only supports 2 screens maximum. So this purchase was basically a complete waste of money. Unfortunate that they don't make the maximum number of displays clearer in the description of this product. I should have done more due diligence before purchasing this card so I gave it 2 stars as this is partially my fault."

It doesn't. The drivers that NVidia provides apparently have a bug that leads to image corruption and instability. The open source drivers don't work very well either.

I use the computer for 3D Modeling and rendering and after having a lot of difficulty with the speed and overall stability of the card I did some research. This card benchmarks roughly 3% of some other cards in the same price range. When I try to render something with any amount of complexity the card cannot handle it and repeatedly shuts off the monitor as it crashes over and over as it tries to complete the task. All of this leads to just a black block the same size as the rendering. I would recommend about 40 other graphics cards before this one."

With this new card using the Displayport connection it works great. I received it and just had Windows 10 download the drivers.
