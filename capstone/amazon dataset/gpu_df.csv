But lately their software has been irritating me, causing issues and whatnot especially when it comes to recording games. I did hear that Radeon has caught up with their graphics cards these days so I decided to try out one of their decent cards.

I kinda wished I knew this ahead of time so I could easily find out what was wrong, but chances are YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES when it comes to the card itself. This is the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, as this was infuriating to figure out, as answers were all over the place. The default settings for the card itself can cause various problems, so you'll have to change them via AMD's Wattman or whatever software you want to use.

In my case, everything installed fine, and from what I could tell at first, the card was running okay. But then I launched Monster Hunter World, set all the settings to max and started up my save file. Everything was perfectly smooth, everything looked awesome. But then I started walking around the main area, Astera, and a few seconds later my PC randomly shut down and restarted. No errors, no blue screen, nothing. This would constantly happen with this game (I didn't bother trying with other games, lol), and I spent the entire day looking for answers. A lot of people would jump to conclusions that the PSU is too weak or faulty. I never had any issues with my PSU, and even though it's weak it's still the min requirements for this card. (450w)

So, after all of that, it's these ""Power States"". Maybe it won't affect all PSUs, but when the card constantly switch between these during gaming, it would drive my PSU/PC crazy and force it to shut down/restart. I'm so glad I finally figured that out, I was ready to give up and return the card for a full refund. I fixed this by clicking Power State 1 and ""set at maximum"", then switching to ""Dynamic"" for frequency, put in a number you want to have. This solved it for me, I just want to point this out since a lot of answers out there would jump to conclusions about the PSU itself.

So, after all that was finally fixed, the card was fine, my game looks perfect and run pretty okay. I'm still toying with the graphic settings to get things running 100% smooth. So this is still an awesome card, just be sure to check the card's settings if you're having issues with power."

Except after using this card for more than 2 hours, it starts to crash and screen flicker my monitor. I did everything I could to make sure it wasn't my drivers that was the issue by installing old drivers and new ones and I still got the same problems. I even upgraded to windows 10 and I still have issues with this graphics card crashing my computer. When I plug in my old gpu, it works perfectly even though i used the same connectors and drivers and never once got an issue with my old gpu. So i returned this card and got a replacement, also the display ports stopped working after a few days of use. After i got my replacement, I thought the card was good and I didn't have to return it but same issues started to happen after using this card again for more than 2 hours. I felt like they sent me faulty cards on purpose or they don't test their graphics cards because twice in a row I got faulty cards from this manufacturer. I had such a massive headache from this card from this manufacturer. I tried to play devils advocate and gave XFX a chance to to redeem themselves by giving me a replacement gpu and that even didn't worked. I will never buy from this manufacturer ever again because I never had this issue with other gpu makers but this one I have to deal with constant crashing of my drivers and computer but when I use my other gpu's I have no issues. This manufacture made me lost trust in AMD because even though 150 bucks isn't a lot to most people, it means a lot to me because my family lives pay check to pay check and it's hard to save up that kind of money and for the product that I paid for to die on me in less than 2 weeks is absurd."

This card does not disappoint it's f****** awesome, Fornite at 1920X1080 100 FPS in performance mode without overclocking. Apex legends in the menu 150 FPS in game highest 112 FPS when things get crowded about 70 it has dipped as low as 58 FPS but that's impressive with this buget GPU and Budget CPU. Dolphin emulator all GameCube games play perfect Mario sunshine in at 50 FPS other games look great like HD remasters!! such as Mario's brothers mansion. Brawl for Wii locked at 60 FPS in fullscreen. No errors in N64 or Wii/GC emulators. My favorite part with the software from amd it's super simple to keep track of CPU,GPU,RAM usage and load. The fans on this GPU may not spin at all unless the temp is at 60C or above so don't freak if the fans are not spinning with the AMD software in the performance section you can override 0 RPM and have fans spin at desired speed. Hope this helped!"

I got a 1603 error so I couldn't install the AMD Adrenalin 2020 control center which you need to make adjustments to your settings. The default settings were not good for gaming. After running the AMD utility, running the DDU utility, removing any possible conflicts, scanning for any corrupt files (there were none), and reinstalling the AMD software, I just kept getting the 1603 error.

Decent gaming with 1080p.

AVOID installing the Radeon Adrenalin software package. Version 2020-edition-20.4.2-apr23 crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME with Doom Eternal in Windows 10 x64. Run the Adrenalin software package to unpack the drivers, then cancel the installation. Then manually install the drivers through the Windows device manager from the directory where the drivers were unpacked to avoid installing the PURELY OPTIONAL Adrenalin software.

Fan noise is barely audible-to-acceptable when gaming. I'm using a full-sized ATX with 120mm intakes and exhausts, so air flow around the video card isn't a problem. Fans are barely audible within a fully-enclosed ATX case when playing Doom Eternal at 1920x1080 / Ultra Nightmare Settings, but it can burst to 100% LOUD AS HELL during POST and stress testing. And I mean LOUD, like fan noise from a 1000 watt microwave kitchen oven!

What's weird about this card is that it has 2 heat pipes installed BUT it has room for a 3rd. There are cut-outs in the heat fins and extra space in the heat-sink where a 3rd heat pipe can be installed, but are purposely left empty. It still works, though."

The card itself seems good, however, their driver support is beyond horrifying. I get constant flickering in any game I try to play. If that isn't annoying enough, I also get this infuriating series of beeps whenever I hit the Ctrl, Alt, Shift keys whether I'm in a game or using Word, etc.
I've tried all the recommended fixes including using the AMD cleanup utility in Safe Mode to remove all traces of the drivers, then downloading and installing the latest version. If you don't have good drivers, even the best hardware is a hopeless pile of trash.
In my opinion, that is exactly what AMD has turned this product into...trash. Thanks AMD, it hasn't been fun."

I wasn't completely sure if this would support our application, but it turned out to be the perfect choice. We did have to purchase 3 cables to go from the card's 3 DisplayPorts to the HDMI inputs on 3 of the monitors and connected the 4th using a standard HDMI cable. Worth noting that you will need two 6-pin power cables available from your PC's power supply to power the card. All in all, the installation and setup took less than an hour. But, that included setting up four displays and downloading the drivers, physically installing the card, etc... I recommend this to anyone needing up to 4 monitors controlled with one display adapter."

I bought this specific card only because it was a deal too good to pass up. This GPU will do everything you need it to and more. From gaming to streaming, the RX 570 will power through it no problem.
Here's my take:

The good:
+ It has no problem playing most AAA's on Ultra or high setting.
+ It runs fairly quiet (idles ~1900).
+ Plays most titles at 60-150+ FPS.
+ Looks good.
+ Low power requirement (450w)
+ Extremely budget friendly for a 8GB GPU.

The Bad:
- RUNS HOT! Even though it is quiet at idle, under load this sucker gets warm. You can expect this guy to hit 80-85c.
- ""Overclockable"". YES, in a sense. As with all GPU's your results will vary.
- Not a NVIDIA.

The Neutral:
+/- Nothing fancy. Only LED on the board is a somewhat annoying small blue light facing outward.

By no means am I regretting this purchase. This card is a work horse and does a wonderful job. However, I do not expect this GPU's lifespan to be a long one. It runs way too hot when doing anything that requires a bit more processing power. Most games run at regular temperatures (65-70c) and idle never jumps over 30c.
But, throw something a little more taxing on it and it will easily rise to unacceptable levels quickly. For me this only happened with certain titles, mostly Xbox PC games (Microsoft Flight Simulator/Cities: Skylines...). All while handling games like Doom, MW and Warframe without even breaking a sweat.
As for the Overclock features, I chose to under-clock and under-volt, going down around a hundred both ways (~1200MHz/1050mV) in an attempt to prolong the life of this GPU.

Prior to installing, be sure to take the card apart to ensure it has enough/or any thermal paste. Mine barely had a smear, not even enough to cover the processor. I could tell the thermal paste was precision applied as it still had the finger print in it :)

All the software issues everyone claims are out there were not present for me. I had zero issues installing and updating and using. Radeon has really focused on streaming so there appear that there are more settings for streaming than there are for gaming.
***UPDATE 11/8/2020***
I did experience some update issues with the new 20.11.1 patch. This was the first time I had any issues and I just fixed it by rolling back to the previous driver.

Although I eventually plan on replacing this for a 6800, overall, I would say this is a great card for a $500 - $1000 dollar build and you should not be counting it out quite yet."

Then I saw a review mentioning how to tweak the card for even better performance. Those settings were under performance tuning changing the card frequency to 1389 and changing the VRAM frequency to 2050. I also maxed the power limit. One other thing I did do is under cpu workload I changed to compute. It seems like it put more of the workload on the card. Before that my graphic card workload was under 15 percent not it goes up to 70 percent at ultra settings which makes the card do what is supposed to.

Make sure you measure the inside of your case, this sucker is huge. It fit in mine, with inches to spare.

I have speed fan on my desktop, ive used it for years to monitor CPU and GPU temps. with my older video card, I was at 50 C during idle. With this new card, im barely at 31 C.

Under full load, I'm about 74 C WOW!!!!

Its very quiet, due to the fact it doesnt need to come on at lower temps with its Extremely efficient heat sinks etc.

It is rated very high on sites that test all these cards. Im running 3 monitors concurrently, with zero glitches. This is an amazing piece of gear.
I used MSI Afterburner to stress test the card! This card didn't break a sweat.

Ive run all types of real time tests, using HD & 4 K video in Avid media Composer, this card has NOT let me down.

The nice fringy benefit is the Voucher for 2 games! sweeeeeet!

-Great bang for the buck
-AMD's software is actually pretty good
-Card goes into quiet mode if not under heavy load
-Dual Bios, though I've never had a use for it
-Can run most games on medium settings, 60fps 1080p

Cons:
-May run a tad hot after awhile
-Cannot run most modern AAA games at high settings (to be expected)
-1440p gaming might be an issue if your aiming for 60fps, definitely not going to do 144fps

Overall:
-The card is a great bang for the buck
-Never actually personally went above 4gb of Vram being used, so you probably don't need the 8gb version
-The card is equivalent to somewhere in between a 1050ti and a gtx 1060
-The card is already a bit old and may need to be replaced after a year or two if you want to continue to play new releases"

It does not run warm on regular internet browsing. But when I played games it would turn on, on various speeds. So I googled and read and read and read information about this video card, and found out that the 2 fans only run when the actual video card turns hot, which I noticed anyway. So it’s not an issue. But today while playing in my pc I smelled something burning. I have my flashlight handy to check if the fan is on or not for this vid card. So as soon as I focused the flash light I saw that the fans weren’t running. I immediately went to check and even put my nose close up to each part of the pc, psu, cpu, hdd and this rx 570. The burning smell is coming out from the rx 570 - positive: and when I went back to my monitor, the screen is almost ready to fade away. I hope I just had a bad item. Bec I would be scared for the others that has this in their system. Bottomline goodluck peeps.

Update 8/23/20
So I returned the xfx card and got MSI gtx 1650. The msi’s fam turns on at 63c. And so far does not go beyond 70c.. i just wanted to point out that most probably I recevied a bad xfx card.
Technically speaking though, the xfx runs smoother than the msi but just runs firey hot bec of the fan issue"

Installed on older MB with PCIe 2 slots, rather than the PCIe 3 the card is intended for.
Software/driver package said it failed to install, but the card is working, I can adjust the settings and it runs my 3 monitors. Fit in my Liam case just fine. I did have a problem initially and the tech support was better than I was anticipating, got me pointed in the right direction.
I ran Firmark and loaded the card up to 100% - It gets up to temp right away, lol but the fans kicks in pretty quick, under that load, the fans are at 100% too! But you really can't hear them - I certainly expected that 100% I'd hear them. I have 7 HD's and a stock cooler, 3 case fans and a pretty passive PS fan - My kit is pretty quiet - This card replaced a passive one and doesn't seem any louder. Under no load the fans in the VC stop and cycle on and off independently. When it first starts up, you can hear the fans, lol! Firmark in the low 40's at my native 2560x1600.

I was then thinking I would put it in my current PC.

I opened in finally in anticipation that it could still use it even though I didn't get to build my new computer -- and I could not get past the fact it was scratched up -- new in the box.

The manufacturer did have protective plastic covering most of the plastic (which itself is scratched - thankfully they cover it up) but there were a few places that did not have protective covering.... The name plate and a small square on the back --- and wouldn't you know those places are the worst looking scratches.

I despise getting new products that are scratched. Especially a computer part that is scratched up. Who wants it in their PC like that? Returning. 3-stars because it is a massive piece of equipment that I would have kept otherwise if not scratched up and showing signs it was handled rough.

I played Gears 5 @1440p with mostly ultra settings and I found it used almost all the 8gb of memory in some instances so I was glad I didn't go with a 4gb. Many modern games are using 5-6gb from what I've experienced when pushing this card so the extra cost is worth the investment imo.

The bad: It runs pretty hot (89-90c) in a case with 2 120mm fans (inlet/outlet). I mean it's a little scary, but it never throttles at those temps. Personally I didn't like those temps so what I did was install MSI afterburner, undervolted it by 100 mV, downclocked it to 1200mhz, and set the fans to run at 60% all the time. This resulted in significant temp drops down into the lower to mid 70's with little noticeable performance loss.

Other thoughts: It black screens once in awhile when exiting games and watching YouTube. I tried different drivers, set it at stock settings, blah blah, but nothing helps. Not sure if it's the drivers or the card, but I'm guessing it's the drivers. I thought AMD was making better drivers these days, but I dunno. I guess I got spoiled using the green team over the years. Honestly I wish I would have waited longer and saved up for a 1660 super, but that card wasn't out yet so no reason crying over spilt milk.

The card does use more power than an nvidia card with similar specs and also creates more heat. But at the same time value for the spec is great. As a product I would give it 4 stars however, XFX's warranty service is surprisingly easy and fast. My card broke after a year of use, so I registered the product on their site, I received a response within 24 hours. They troubleshooted and determined the card needs to be RMAed, I sent the card back and I received a new one within a week after they received the defective card. They didn't even require the receipt(required by most companies) even though I had it. It's amazing service compare to my PNY nvidia experience which was like pulling teeth.

A few things to note:

1: This is a fairly large GPU, if you don't have a Full Tower, or an opened-air mobo, your mileage with fitting this thing in a Mid Tower WILL differ

2: My old GPU require two 6-pin, while this GPU required one 8-pin, you will either need an 8-pin or a 6+2 pin to connect your power supply to your GPU, if you don't have a powersupply that you modify, well you will need a new one.

3: For the price, this GPU is very strong, even if it is only a rehash of the 480... and being a year old. It can still run newer titles like Monster Hunter: World without too many problems.

4: Price-wise, having to compete with cryto-miners may increase the price of this GPU from time to time... very annoying.

The first one wouldn't work at all, the second one worked for less than two months. When it was working, it was beautiful but it has to work. I will never again buy an XFX product.

I've spent about 6 hours trying to troubleshoot this card. So far I've not gotten it to work once. System POSTs, windows sounds tell me that windows is booting, but I NEVER get any video. Forced driver installation overtop old graphics card and reset with new driver. Still nothing. This isn't my first graphics card installation, and I've never had one go this poorly. Did I get a dud?

EDIT: The first one never did work, but the replacement worked fine. Had to purchase a new Power Supply to get full use out of it. Perhaps I have a needy system but 500W wasn't enough to get it running at max efficiency. What I will say is that, now that I have it running properly, the picture is GORGEOUS. Absolutely love it.

EDIT 12/12/2018 - So my saga of the XFX Radeon RX 580 has come to an end. I am returning the card after some very helpful product support from Amazon worked through diagnosing issues on the second card, which replaced the one that wouldn't work from the start. I had the card installed for about 40-45 days before it cut out in the middle of playing a game one night. The system wouldn't even post, so I thought it might be an issue with the motherboard or the power supply which I had purchased to power this card. During diagnostics, it turns out it was the video card, which I learned was indicating a defective card. (Genuine thanks to Amazon Product Support!) It was preventing the system from even POSTing.

This card is headed to UPS today and I will never again purchase an XFX product. I can be pretty forgiving and recognize that sometimes flawed products make it through. This, however, is indicative to me of a larger issue."

At 2560x1080 ultrawide, it slays the games I play. GTA 5 and Fallout 4 nearly max out (sometimes have to trade shadow quality for SSAA or vice-versa depending on preferences) and I have absolutely no problem maintaining 60fps with 70°c or below while playing them. I will be testing more titles but if you are below 1440p this card should be able to play anything at medium settings or above incl. new titles. I have it at 1384MHz with a custom fancurve to keep temps in check (this fan really isn't very loud at 50% or below anyways; I had to put my m.2 under the GPU which makes me a little nervous so I'd rather have the area as actively cooled as possible) but it does in fact sit at 0rpm unless you're gaming which is very nice. I'd recommend this card for any gaming under 1440p or even at 1440p lower-mid settings depending on the games you prefer; it seems very reliable so far and the 8gb vram is nice; having high-res textures in games is super nice, and I've had no problems; I'd recommend this over the 1060 6gb unless you can get one for $230 or less.

Update: Pushing memclocks to 2250 in wattman will squeeze a few extra frames out of furmark and so far seems stable on my card. Increasing clockspeeds actually made performance slightly worse for furmark likely due to it causing throttling, so I actually have the core at 1350MHz and the mem at 2250MHz now, running a little better than stock.

Edit 8 months later: I had IMC issues with Ryzen 5 2600 and tried rma this card thinking it was at fault because I had BSODs and CTDs while gaming. Ended up replacing the CPU and found out it was not the gpu. However playing far cry at 1080 ultra for 45 min caused the gpu to crap out. No Mobo would post with it installed. I have reached out to their support and hope to hear back. Last time they were prompt but I did assemble and reassemble the gpu with new tm (to no avail) which technically voids warranty. If they don't hold up on warranty that's my fault but if so I'll be ecstatic. Good experience mostly but too bad multiple faulty parts have left me with a great PC becoming useless.

2020: Laaaate update - XFX straight up sent me a brand new retail card many months ago and have had no issues since. RMA is very good in the US."

After many hours of troubleshooting the obvious (swapping cables, reinstalling, etc) it is narrowed down to a lack of bandwidth or too much noise on the HDMI port.

It seems that the drivers detect the display and set the color space to 4:4:4, which in my experience is unstable on this card on any display. Under this setting, it's impossible to game because the screen blanks out every couple seconds. I've tried a dozen different cables with no improvement, even a cable known to work perfectly at 4k 60hz on Xbox One X.

My running theory is that the port itself can't handle the required 18gbps bandwidth that 4:4:4 4k 60hz requires, and/or the card produces enough electrical noise (under load) that it bleeds into the port causing the display to re-handshake repeatedly.

Switching to displayport works fine, but if you're stuck on HDMI 2.0, this should help:

Change the color format to 4:2:0 in Radeon display settings. 4:2:2 is also unstable for me.

No overclocking, actually I turned the clock speed down to keep in step with the heat and turned the fans on earlier and to higher speed with the AMD tuner software. I have large tower with plenty of of intake and exhaust fans and my chipset temperature is 33 Celsius on idle, so it's not my system. Also my older card doesn't have this problem. This card- just simply gave up on a pause screen for 1 minute, playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. The fans were spinning but nothing seems to help this card in control.
I have to say this isn't the first ATI card doing this to me, but at least my previous RX 480 was stable, although it was running a bit hot. My previous GFX card was a GTX 980 and runs without a hiccup, no overheating no issues whatsoever, what I needed is more RAM, my GTX had only 4, and some games today won't even try to load the textures for high/very high settings if the game doesn't detects at least 6GB of RAM.
What happens is, the game (any game using 3D engine apparently) runs ok for about 5-10 minutes and then the monitor suddenly goes to sleep for about 2 seconds, and then it comes up. It will keep repeating this until I turn off the game. Also the fans are way too loud on this. Even with not so demanding games, games that were made 3-4yrs ago, the fans kick in and run loud like it's struggling to keep the heat down, even though an on-board graphics from Intel or AMD could run those games with no issues.
I only got this card, because I built a whole new AMD system,
Ryzen 2600 CPU
16GB RAM
480GB SSD +1TB HD
*(prevously GTX 980)
I literally tried all settings on both the card, the monitor, my PC, even fresh installation of Win10, then card driver cleaning, replacing fans in my pc case, adding more, buying new diplayport cables, trying HDMI cables, nothing fixes it.

I got the xfx Rx 580 GTA 1386mhz last Wednesday 9-19-18 and man my old reference rx480 definitely had power draw problems. I knew something was amuck but couldn't prove it.

Day 1. Installed and ran firestrike. My old graphics score was beat by 200 points higher by this card.

Day 2. Opened up doom and barely got below 85 fps in 1080p. Even battlefront 2 had better performance for me. I think it was 75+ fps (I have an i7 4790 non k and regretting not getting the k)

Day 3. card runs beautiful I played some online doom and didn't have any lag or low fps as expected.

I'm now on day 5. And not regretting buying this card. I even overclocked it to 1450mhz and 2050 on VRAM and it doesn't give me a hitch or any issues!

Day 19
I have no problems with the card. It handles everything I throw at it! Even squad. I have to use a bunch of medium settings due to amds compatibility, but I get 60fps.on most areas with my i7 4790."

While running at stock settings, the card runs relatively cool and quiet. My card overclocked pretty well, and I'm able to get an additional 10% of performance at the expense of higher temps and louder fans. At stock settings, the GPU stays below 70c at load, and up to 82c with my current overclock. I'm able to run the new Resident Evil 2 with Max settings at a locked 1080p/60 with ease. I am also able to run a locked 4K/30 in RE2 with no drops in performance. Many older games are able to run at resolutions up to 4K/60, and many modern games are even good at 1440p/60.

AMD's software is leaps and bounds above what I remember from the Catalyst Software days. I remember having driver problems which cause sound problems over HDMI when I had an HD 7870. I also had problems with the Crimson Drivers in an RX 480 build I did for a friend a couple years back. In that build, I had to loan him one of my GTX cards for a few months because his RX 480 was unusable due to a driver issue that caused the screen to flicker black. After a driver update, the GPU finally worked for him. I have had no issues with my RX 580, and the only crashes I've had are from pushing my overclock slightly too far. After dialing my OC back, I have run it for hours straight with 82c temps without a hitch.

Now the best part, I basically got this card for $85 thanks to the bundled games. I planned on waiting for AMD's new cards later this year, but I had a friend who told me he was getting Resident Evil 2 and The Division 2 when they released. I asked him if he would be willing to buy the codes from me to help lower the cost of a new GPU, and he agreed. So after tax, my $205 (including tax) RX 580 became an $85 steal after selling the bundled games to my friend for $120. If you know someone wanting to buy both games, or you intend on getting 2 of the 3 games, I believe this card is a no-brainer. You can easily sell the card for over $85 over the next couple of years if you decide you want to upgrade to something faster.

Keep in mind, claiming the free games requires a bit of effort, and it would be hard to sell the free games to anyone you don't know. Basically, I had to create an AMD rewards account to claim the games. The account has to detect the GPU installed in your system to claim the free games, so you can't simply sell the AMD key to someone else. Once the AMD activation site confirms your hardware, it allows you to choose 2 out of the 3 games available: Resident Evil 2, The Division 2, and Devil May Cry 5. Once those games are chosen, then the AMD account has to be tied to your Steam account to activate the game to the steam library. Again, it works with a willing friend, but it will be difficult to do if you plan on selling the keys to someone you don't know well.

All in all, I am really happy with this purchase. If crossfire was still worth using these days, I would buy another one and keep the bundled games for myself. It's that good of a deal.

A final thought, if you are interested in all 3 of the bundled games, the RX 590, Vega 56, Vega 64, and the upcoming Radeon VII come with all 3 games: effectively lowering the cost of those GPU's a staggering $180! If my friend could have waited a couple of weeks to play RE2, I would have waited for the Radeon VII's release. But he couldn't wait, and I'm still very satisfied that I jumped on a great deal!"

The card itself works well, to reassure anybody who might be on the fence or needs a video card as soon as possible. A replacement card for my now dead 970 from newegg arrived DoA (One of those 100 buck sapphire 470s), so, out of panic, knowing that my RMA would probably take something along the line of two weeks, I snatched one of these bad boys up at a small premium compared to the offers on other sites. It arrived swift, as per usual, and it plugged in and got working right away. Honestly, I love it, i'd say its right on par with my old 970 at a very agreeable price. To anyone who hasn't looked at in depth performance reviews, one of these cards is able to handle pretty much every recent game, except overly resource-hungry modern titles, at a comfortable 40-60+ fps depending on the setting of your choice and whether or not you add additional shaders. Coming from anything below a 970, whether it be an r9 series, 7xx, radeon xxxx, you should be rather satisfied with one of these cards. I recommend them especially at this price point. I'm not sure if it's posted anywhere on this product page or brought to attention well enough, but you do get a selection of two out of three games coming out soon, so assuming you're interested in the division 2, DMC5, or resident evil 2, this could potentially be a very smart move so you don't have to purchase those any more.

Small(large) edit: So, apparently I thought I was having issues with this thing once I switched to a 1440p monitor; however, there is a pretty gigantic quirk that I thought might bring light so some common complications with this card. This card is best for 1080p gaming, period. However, with 1440p it can work, but there is a bit of a complication with how AMD gpus tend to work in general lately, especially the Polaris line, which this card belongs to. You may notice that sometimes under intense load that your screen might flicker. This brought me no end of annoyance at first, but I discovered that you basically have to go into global settings (under ""Gaming"") with radeon's software and tab into wattman to do some editing. At the bare minimum, without any other adjustments, you need to adjust the power limit on this card to around +20%~ or more if it has to do any heavy lifting, otherwise it will throttle one way or another with differing symptoms. Amd has thrown out a bunch of efficiency software and tuning which end up under powering your card where it may need it in desperate times. This isn't overclocking, but this does actually allow for proper overclocking, if you don't wish to proceed any further than this, you don't need to. I'm not sure why they thought it would be wise to essentially choke this thing for power right out of the box, but it seems to be a reality. My card works as it should now 1440p, but do monitor temperatures with HW monitor, and adjust the fan speed curve as need be, just to be certain (My case has awful airflow). Wattman can be a fantastic utility, so utilize it!

Just be sure you have enough power to back the card up, I do fine @ 550W and an i5 6600k, but you should plan out your power usage just as a precaution. Knowledge is power!"

We tried to reinstall drives, reseat the card, reformat the OS, then adjust the settings. All of these failed to resolve the issue. We then thought it might be related to the CPU or its heatsinks so we put in a new motherboard, memory, and CPU. This also had no effect, so I go looking for this issue and low and behold I am not the first person to have this problem.

- It is low profile and occupies only one PCI slot. This is important since my PC has a SFF (small form factor) case with limited space.
- It consumes very little power (20W max), so even the 220W power supply in my PC can handle it.
- It uses only heatsink for passive cooling. This eliminates the noise and reliability problems associated with cooling fans.

[Installation Confusion]
- Initially right after the graphic card was installed, I can only get a display of 1200x800 from the HDMI port. Nothing from VGA port.
- After I installed the MSI VGA Drivers from disc, my monitor can now display 1920x1080 from VGA port, but nothing from HDMI port.

The problem could be from my computer's motherboard, since I observed the same behavior with the  EVGA GeForce 210  I previously purchased (and returned). Just keep this behavior in mind, in case you cannot see any display right after installing the card.

[Graphic Performance]
I ran the 3DMARK 'Cloud Gate' benchmark on my PC, both before and after the graphic card upgrade:
- With integrated graphic, the overall score is a pathetic 209.
- After installing the GT 710, the score jumps up to 3735!
(see my uploaded screenshots for details)

On the other hand, the GT 710 cannot hold a candle against my better graphic card, the  EVGA GeForce GTX 750 Ti . When both cards were tested in a newer desktop PC ( Asus M32CD ), the 750 gives about 4x higher score . Note that the 750 does not fit in my old SFF PC since it is much larger. See my photo uploaded for size comparison between 710 and 750.

[Power Consumption]
I used the  EUM-A1 Power Usage Meter  to measure the input power of my computer:
- Before the graphic card upgrade, my computer consumes ~50-55W when idle, ~70-75W when running 3DMARK.
- After the upgrade to GT 710, my PC consumes the same 50-55W when idle. This means this graphic card has the same standby power as the integrated graphic chip set.
- When running 3DMARK or  XCOM: Enemy Unknown , my PC now consumes up to 85-90W. That means the graphic card consumes 15-20W when it is running at full speed.

After I played XCOM for several hours, the heatsink becomes too hot to touch, but not hot enough to cause a shutdown. In contrast, the EVGA GeForce 210 suffers thermal shudown after just ~10-20 minutes of playing XCOM. This is because the 210 consumes more power (30W vs. 20W) but comes with a smaller heatsink.

[Conclusion]
The GT 710 works very well in my particular situation. Of cause this is an inexpensive entry-level card, so I cannot expect the same level of performance as my GeForce GTX 750 Ti. But for a very small investment, I'm suddenly able to play many games which were previously unplayable on my old SFF PC. For that I'm happy."

I was looking for a way to boost the performance of an old Gateway SX2801-01e, thin profile desktop. It was maxed out on RAM (8 GB), but for whatever reason, just couldn't seem to generate graphics smoothly and without struggling. Not gaming, mind you, but for place-shifting and streaming video, and having multiple applications open. This card fit in the sole expansion slot for a PCI x16 card. My main concern was that the dated BIOS would be too ancient, or that the card would simply freeze up the computer. Neither happened. It booted into low-resolution at first while the drivers updated automatically. But after the updates and a couple of reboots, I was back in business. This old desktop has new life, as it runs like a new computer. (I had already migrated to a Samsung SSD and added a USB 3.0 card.) The built-in 2GB or RAM is supremely helpful. I'm also running with a 220W power supply, and not the recommended 300W without issues. It consumes a mere 19W. I'm going to upgrade my older monitor with a higher-resolution one now that the graphics card can support it."

Instructions are not included for installing the low profile bracket. What you do:
Use a pair of needle nose pliers and unscrew the long bracket by twisting the little bolts that you woudl normally screw the video cable into. Just pinch the sides of each bolt and give little short twists (lefty loosey) until it comes loose, keep track of your bolts, and then once all four are out, you can easily separate the VGA socket (at the top in the main picture). The included short profile brackets are pretty obvious for placement, just watch the orientation. You'll end up using two of your external slots, but only the one PCI slot on the motherboard. The little bolts screw back in to the new brackets, and it's just fast and simple. I don't even think I ended up using a screwdriver at all, but the case we have was pretty much made for fast, painless installation without tools. The pliers are a must, though.

While this does say it requires a 300w power supply, it's running absolutely fine on a 240w power supply. Didn't even have to plug it in to a separate power cable (which is good, because there wasn't one.) We're using it for older Steam games (Spore, for example) for my kid, on a Windows 7 machine we bought for $250, and this upgrade brings the machine pretty painlessly up to a decent standard for a lot of games. Just don't try to max your graphics out, because you don't want to overheat a fanless card.

Anyway, I'm pleased. Oh, and everything comes packaged with little red caps over the connectors, which makes handling it a lot less nerve wracking while you're figuring the brackets out. A card I can hold easily while dicking around with the bracket? Thank you! They recommend using rubber gloves to avoid nicks, and I didn't, but this still may be the first time I've installed a video card when I didn't end up bleeding."

I need the sound for YouTube and other sounds on the PC. Video still works fine. Changed HDMI cables and tried switching ports on the TV/monitor. Still no sound. Support says get an RMA number on website and send it in for repair. That is not what I need. I need a replacement video card as I need the video card for my PC. I'll buy a different brand and send this one back to Amazon if that is their support.
Update 11/26/18: Are these cards not any good? Should I return this one for credit and purchase a better card. After purchasing this card, the HDMI slot lost the sound. I contacted the vendor and they wanted it returned for repair. It was only a week or so old. Instead of sending it in, I paid another $9 or so for a DVI to HDMI adapter cable and used the DVI slot on the card. I received sound and pictures for about 3 months and ow the sound has gone out on the DVI slot on the card. I did not want to return it as then my PC is out of video and sound until they take their sweet time to repair a $30 card rather than ship me a new one. This has broken twice so I recommend not to purchase this card for anything as it is junk and the customer support lacks a lot of support."

There was originally only 4GB of RAM on the machine and integrated graphics. It would not even play Fortnite. After adding the graphics card it would play but did lag or would even crash some times. I then upgraded the RAM with an additional 8GB (4GB x 2 sticks) for a total of 12GB. Now he says it plays pretty smooth with no lagging or crashing. He does have the resolution turned down to the lowest setting. It's a $45 card and that's what I would expect, but I don't think he tried to turn it up since adding the RAM. He wasn't looking to build a gaming rig and just needed a better graphics card over what was integrated.

His specs:
Dell Vostro 460
i5 processor
12GB RAM
320GB 7200 RPM HD

I also bought the 4 year warranty on it for $1.54, so he can nuke it and I don't care. :)"

Their quality is great, their cards perform well and their Afterburner software is second to none.

Let's be up front about one thing here: a GT 710 is a GT 710. If you're looking for a gaming card, even just to play Windows Store games, look to at least a 730 or, better, a 750 Ti for entry level gaming.

With that behind us, let's talk about reasonable expectations for a 710. The purpose of a 710 is to give an old computer with no digital video output an HDMI jack. It's to beef up a PC with vintage 2006 integrated graphics and allow it to work with modern displays. It's my expectation that if a graphics card supports a given resolution, be that 1080p, 1440p or even 4k, that it will be capable of smooth video playback at that resolution. I chose this 710 for my HTPC because it supports 4k resolution, and I just needed my ancient PC to push 4k video. That's it.

And here's where this card failed me. 4k video playback was subpar. It was choppy, the HDMI audio cut in and out, and it wasn't just one source. YouTube, local content, it all looked bad. 1080p was much better, but the 4K display did it no favors.

The 710's saving grace was that it was able to push convincing 1080p video to a 1080p monitor, and maybe that's really all it's useful for. If that's your use case, and for plenty of people I'm sure it is, this is a decent, cheap card for you.

Mine was returned. I didn't even bother goofing around with overclocking or temperature testing because I just didn't see a need to. The 710 clearly wasn't quite enough for my needs."

It replaced old ATI HD 4600 series graphics cards which developed issues with dual monitor with the original Windows 10 creators Update and new blue screen issues with the Fall Creators Update. While ATI stopped supporting their product in 2015, Nvidia still releases a solid set of drivers that support the latest version of Windows 10. This MSI version of the GT 710 is very flexible. It supports both low profile (2 slots with brackets included), and standard profile (only 1 slot needed), and is cable of driving 2 HD monitors with ease. Compared to the HD 4650 it was replaced with, the 2d images and text see clearer and the colors more vibrant, even on 15 year old monitors running analog. Even though this is not a gaming card, it holds its own for the light to casual gamer and does not need a lot of power from the PSU to do so."

Solid DXVA capabilities for an HTPC. Worked great to replace a dying 7600GS in my dad's computer. Very low power.

Passive cooling might not be enough for this card if you task it alot and have a case with very low airflow. My dad's small form factor PC saw it running in the 80s celsius just running some light games. I attached a slim low-noise 40mm fan to it with a ziptie and that was easily enough to cool it down. Now it never gets above 60*C when playing games for hours. So be aware the cooler is just too small to be a good passive cooler for games and DXVA in a super tight case. In a case with better airflow this is probably less of an issue.

It's paired with a C2D E7500 Wolfdale 2.93Ghz and 8GB DDR-2 800 RAM so not an amazing PC but enough to push this card along well enough. It runs Youtube, Netflix and Media Player Classic with 1080p mkvs smoothly. It has HDMI output which makes it good for our occasional HTPC needs. Again the card does DXVA okay, but not amazingly. Combined with the CPU it's more than enough to handle high bitrate 1080p which is the goal. So for that it's pretty useful despite the low performance. Better at DXVA than the 7600GS by a longshot.

Modern features but very weak performance. Runs older games somewhat worse than the ancient 7600GS it replaced, and newer games just a little better. This card isn't intended for games, but it would be nice to see it perform more like its specs. It's not as disastrous as the GT210 was, with simply broken performance, but it's pretty weak.

That said, it runs Source games okay with the settings scaled back, and runs Battlefield 1942, Call of Duty/UO and lots of other popular older games. My dad uses it to play Rome Total War and Medieval 2 nearly cranked which makes him happy. Runs most lighter-weight newer games with low settings as well. So it's not totally helpless, but it's not meant to compete as a gaming card. AMD's APUs are much faster than this, and the integrated in newer Intel CPUs is also much faster. For my dad's older PC though, this MSI GT710 was a perfectly reasonable replacement part."

Not the best but it'll get the job done.,"This is an older card of course so I can't recommend it for newer gaming. But It can keep up with maybe 80% of my steam library, which has lots of games pre-2016. Just don't expect to do some seriously high-end gaming and you're probably fine. Always check the game's specs and if a card is still in support when looking for what you need.

It was A BUTT to get the screws out to install it into the case because they were in so tight, but everything else about the install went smoothly. We have an HD monitor, and everything looks great. Supports the sound to said monitor as well. NVIDIA drivers are fantastic because they let you know when there's an update unobtrusively and they're very simple to install. Just a few clicks and 1-2 screen flashes and you're done. Supports dual monitors.

This went into a half-tower with an offensively small power supply (300w) so I had to unplug the blu-ray drive but it is working fantastically. For the price, I really have no complaints. It's been working great, and since the card is still in support, you'll continue to get drivers so your games don't crash suddenly. Or cook itself to death, like the card it replaced."

Short story. RMA'd the card. Was quickly repaired and sent back to me via Fedex (less then 2 weeks). However MSI didn't bother to ask me if it needed any special instructions return shipping, so it didn't bother to tell Fedex to make sure I signed for it. Fedex said they delivered it (to my door) so I am 100% certain it was stolen (for my neighborhood, thats a big fat DUH). MSI says its not their fault, and that if I had wanted it signed for I should have called and said so. One guy told me that they don't automatically tell Fedex to make sure its signed for because it costs them more to ship it that way.

In short. too bad, your screwed, we didn't follow up on getting proper shipping instructions or even bother to ASK YOU if we should. Its your fault it got stolen, deal with it. Tried to call Corporate HQ multiple times, the secretary is NEVER there, messages go unanswered. 2 months now without a card.

Great for business use!,"I needed a video card quickly to get my office PC back up and running. For some reason, my old video card stopped outputting 3840x2160 @ 30Hz (30 frames/sec), and went back down to 1080p. Because my monitor at the office is 3840x2160, that meant I only had 1/4 as much space for windows, and my productivity was hurting.
My old card, a Radeon HD 5450, required that I use drivers from 2012 to let me drive that video timing out on HDMI. But one fateful day, even the old drivers refused to send it, with no explanation as to why. I also had to rig up a little device to keep the HPD (Hot Plug Detect) signal from going away when I turned my monitor off, or the Radeon would switch to the DVI output. Every. Single. Time. It was really frustrating.
So I went and got this, because I was just looking for a card with the following:
- It outputs 3840x2160 @ 30Hz on HDMI
- It's silent
- Low power
I did about 5 minutes of research, found this, verified on nVidia's website that it would do it (it's spelled out that it will), and whipped out my credit card and hit ""Order Now."" I ordered it on Thursday, and Amazon had it to me on Friday (even though it was normal Prime 2-day shipping). Bonus.
So I crack open my mid-tower, find the old card covered in dust (but it was also a fanless card, and the dust blew right off, no probs), and slap this in. The driver install took ages (gotta have all of those patches and tweaks for games I won't be playing...) and eventually I was back up and running. With this card, 3840x2160 showed up, and was marked as preferred. And when I turn off my monitor and turn it back on again later, it didn't switch to DVI because it decided to. Excellent.
To summarize:
- Works with 2016 drivers in 4K, unlike some other budget cards
- Doesn't decide spontaneously to switch to DVI from HDMI
- I'm happy with it"

It is not and should not be marketed as a ""gaming"" card. I have a ~2015 Dell Optiplex that has a half-height form factor that I use at my work. The motherboard on the Dell only supports a single VGA output and I really prefer a dual-monitor setup for productivity. I had an old XFX-branded Radeon HD5450 in the case that was doing dual-monitor duty just fine for all this time running Windows 7. When Windows 7 support ended my computer had to be reformatted and a fresh Windows 10 install was done with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled. What we discovered was the BIOS/UEFI changes that were necessary were incompatible with the old Radeon card.

I picked up this GT 710 for a very specific use case. It had to be small-form factor (low-profile brackets), had to be low-power and passively cooled, able to support multiple monitors outputs, and had to support UEFI. This MSi card fit all the criteria. It comes with the standard bracket installed but took a matter of minutes to put the 2 included low-profile brackets on with the correct tools. I installed it in the computer very easily but I was surprised that the card only took up about half of a PCI-e slot. The physical length of the card only occupies the first half of the slot and it doesn't even engage the PCI-e locking mechanism. Once the card is bolted down it doesn't move.

It booted fine and worked for me without any additional drivers. The Nvidia control panel was even added by Windows without any user intervention. I'm running the card with the stock power supply and running two 1080p monitors, one on HDMI and one with DVI-D. So far so good."

This one runs about 95 F. I didn't buy this card for gaming just wanted a decent card to run in my old Dell Optiplex desktop. I don't need the low profile adapters. Mine isn't a small form factor.

At only 2gb of video RAM, I would be careful of what games are played with this card.

I purchased this card knowing it was low-profile, which was good. It fit right into the case and snapped in without issue. No need to connect anything beyond that and the whole process took 5 minutes.

The card ships with a driver CD. I installed the drivers and the additional software on the CD but ended up removing the additional software as it related to overclocking and I didn't need it.

I like this card as it costs less than fifty bucks and boosts the overall video performance of PCs with integrated graphics. This 2GB card is better than most of the 1GB cards at around the same price point and provides users with the option to have a dual monitor setup.

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 12/17/2019:
I just picked up a new HDTV, the Samsung 43"" model UN43NU6900BXZA which offers 4K and UHD. Amazon carries it as does Bestbuy and others locally. It may be a baseline model, but, wow, the pic quality is extremely crisp and clean. The MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB is working perfectly with my new 4K Samsung, using my Mac Pro running Mojave.

This card supports 4K and there was no adjustments in settings needed for setup, the card and my 4K Samsung communicated perfectly and my Mac Pro make the resolution settngs seamlessly in the background upon connecting.
The quality of my Mac Pro now (running Mojave for the present) is stellar. Details, fine text, screen fit, contrast, color...etc...it all looks superb.

If you are considering a 4K display upgrade, YES, this card will work perfectly with it!
---------------------------
I needed an inexpensive card to upgrade my Mac Pro 5.1 mid-2012 and this card works perfectly for that. No power cable needed and a very small profile that won't get in the way of other cards and slots. It is self powered by the PCIe bus so no power cable was needed.

Of course there is no boot screen during boot nor a way to select which drive to boot from if you have more than one OS drive. You can easily though, change the ""start-up"" drive once the OS is booted and loaded in System Preferences, so not a big deal for me.

I am using the HDMI output to a Samsung 1080 HDTV and there was no need to tweak screen fit or anything. The card booted right up to a perfect screen display.

I've tried a few other Apple recommended cards in the past and honestly, none did any better than this. I returned one at over $150 simply because I decided to wait for a lower priced card to do the same thing and this MSI card does! Additionally, this card seems to wake my Mac out of sleep very quickly. The older cards I tried seemed very sluggish to do that, this card seems much more responsive to wake my Mac. A Win-Win in here!

HMDI won't pass the audio, but, no cards out there will do that unless specifically made for a Mac Pro and flashed correctly. I have optical and digital output on my M. Pro so not a biggie.

The card seems responsive and fast and at some point I will do a ""Geekbench"" test. The 1080 on my Samsung HDTV looks crisp and clear output from this card. I would say 1080 looks slightly better on this card than my old OEM one that came installed on my Mac. Small icon seems a bit crisper and clearer. Close to the old card, but, there is definitely a bit of improvement there.

The card is fan cooled and since I won't be gaming with this desktop, it should run very cool routinely.

5 Stars all around and a great way to upgrade an older Mac Pro on the cheap."

I need a high-resolution monitor for imagery and business only. I finally figured out that to get really good resolution for my purposes, you have to go for a gaming video card. I was having lots of problems with my on-board video on a win10 machine with i7 cpu. Was also having problems with my geforce 750 ti card that had worked well at 2560x1440 on my old win7 machine. As it turns out, my problems on the win10 were probably due more to outdated cables. While I was troubleshooting, I picked up this video card for $53. Using a 2.0 hdmi cable with great reviews, this card has worked flawlessly on my win10 machine at 2560 x 1440. I'm now using the 750 ti on my older win7."

It will help encourage me to continue my real reviews of products I've purchased.

Likes: * Really only took 10 mins to install this great video card. * I love that this FANLESS card works flawlessly * Easy installation, took more work researching than actually installing. Had one of my computer wires snag the card initially, but was easily held out of way so the card would fit in slot on motherboard. * Installation videos were spot on providing valuable information. * Love the protective caps provided for shipping and also able to be used after installation to keep dust out of unused monitor outs

Dislikes: * The Heatsink card has slightly slower specs than the fan cooled card. I can live with less specs as heat and noise are major concerns of mine.

Yes I'd buy this card again and recommend to a friend or relative.

Great upgrade.,"Ok, so you’re reading this review wondering about whether or not to spend your money. I did the same, and i shouldn’t have waited as long as i did to buy this. 1) My Pc was terrible. it still is terrible. it’s a prebuilt from like 8 years ago and if you know anything about pc gaming you know how slow old gaming builds are. 2) i don’t have a monitor. i play on an old flatscreen Tv from, again, like 8 years ago. 3) cards are expensive as all hell. i don’t make steamer casse i’m a casual player, but i still want a mediocre setup.
This card is amazing, if you’re looking to upgrade old parts and don’t have $500 laying around like a lot of people, but this one. If you’re not good with computers and are afraid of having to put one in yourself, it’s simple plug and play. there are thousands of youtube videos that show you how. i don’t know computers. i’m a grease monkey i work on cars. it took me 5 minutes and one screw driver.

obviously if you’re looking for some massive quality upgrade and 144 hz monitor, 3000$ Pc , then no this isn’t for you. but if you’re like me, and want some decent quality of life upgrades, buy this."

While the card itself is good, I've wasted an hour trying to get the bonus. I received an email from Amazon with a code and web link. I followed the link, had to give lots of personal information to create an account at GeForce, to finally get to the proper page. After entering the very long code and the ""I'm not a robot"" validation, it gave a cryptic message ""Please use GeForce Experience 3.17 to redeem this promo code. You can download it at <redacted link at NVIDIA>. I have no idea what that is, why I need it, or why I wasn't sent there to begin with. So, I went to *that* link, downloaded it, went through a time-consuming install, which *seemed* to complete. Then I started it (but it seems to report it as an older version 3.10.x, although Add/Remove programs only shows 3.6.0.74) and (after quite a wait) it reported another useless message of ""NVIDIA Installer failed"" and a link for ""Need help troubleshooting?""

When I go to *that* link, I get an Amazon page displaying 129 items that reference ""Fortnite bundle"" ... no help at all for anything related to my issue.

So, if you want a video card, consider this only as if you won't get any bonus with it. I've lost way too much time trying to get the ""bonus"". It's not worth it."

Now that the mining craze has settled down, these cards are an excellent price for what they offer.

NOTE: The ""Windforce OC Edition"" requires a 6-pin power cable that is not included. I got mine to work just fine with a cheap 4-pin Molex to 6-pin adapter. If your PSU has no unused connectors, either buy the smaller version of the card that doesn't require the additional 6-pin connection or upgrade your PSU.

It seems when the cards work, they work great being an Nvidia GeForce 1050 GPU. However lately they have been crashing while performing 3D gaming duties. The monitor loses signal and cannot recover. The sound proves that the game is still going; the game did not crash.

I monitored heat, ran GPU burner programs, tried different drivers to no avail. The heat plateaus off at safe levels; the GPU programs cannot replicate the issues; the behavior doesn't change with different driver versions or different games. Currently, I am trying to work with Gigabyte for warranty replacement on both cards. Yes, both cards.

Update 1/25/2019:
I received both cards back from Gigabyte --untouched-- with a packing list (yes, packing list; nothing else) that hinted both cards were out of region. When I submitted the cards for RMA, they stated only one was out of region. Now they say BOTH are out of region. Their 3-year warranty is absolute crap when they won't stand by their product. I will throw these in the trash and go a different brand. You have been warned."

Its a simple upgade!","First off lets look what I'm using this in: A old Walmart ""box"" Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer. With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.

Playing what would be considered ""simple single and multi-player games"" with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.

Well this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking ""CPU"" power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now ""booking"" on all my games and simulators!

The GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.

I currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.

So far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.

All in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer.

Installed in about 5 minutes,"Got the card today and working great. Installed in about 5 minutes. Probably would of installed quicker but I spent about 2 minutes looking for the pin jacks for the power supply. (someone in the Q&A said that this card (with 2 fans has to be plugged into the power supply). It doesn't. No connections anywhere on card for separate power supply connection on the card , the whole thing is powered just by sliding it into the PCI e slot. When I first installed the card and turned on PC it used a generic windows driver for about 5 minutes until windows update immediately downloaded and installed the driver from Nvida. One thing, the driver that Windows 10 pulled was pretty old and out of date so you will most certainly want to download the software and run it. I just googled the card name, took me right to their website where you can download a program from Nvida called (GeForce Experience) that will auto detect your card, and download the very latest driver, you can also select in the settings to auto update the driver as new versions come out.

Ran some stress tests on it (not very long about 10 minutes or maybe less, but temp of the card never went over 64 degrees C which is very good. Stress test is designed to push the card to the limits and if the card doesn't run super hot your in good shape. Runs at a steady 32-33 degrees in my computer when not gaming and just using internet and basic windows programs.

Overall I think this card is great value for mid range gaming on the newest games, and any of the older favorites should run at top settings. Also this card has sound drivers built in. Which kind of shocked me. My old card didn't and I was using headphones for the longest time. I was kind of shocked when all the sudden my monitor started having sound come out of it. I didn't even know my monitor had speakers built in to be honest.lol"

It has taken all of them with no problem. It even plays 4k Netflix, which is the main reason I bought it.

The hardest part of the install was having to re-route some cabling in my HTPC case. Other than that, it's simple. I didn't even have to plug in additional power, it works off the mainboard as long as your power supply has enough juice.

Update 05/25/19: Occasionally, and randomly, the display blinks (goes black for a moment). Some videos it's horrible, others it's a couple times at most. There isn't any specific pattern, and is not easily duplicated. Apparently I'm not the only person with this issue, per other reviews.

Finally in January of this year I sent the card in, hoping they'd fix or replace it, but it was returned with the note that they couldn't find a problem.

All I wanted was a reliable low-profile graphics card that would fit in my slim PC case. What I got was a lemon that's been nothing but a pain from the beginning. It works, but only just enough to get my hopes up before eventually flickering, going black, and requiring yet another reboot."

When I first purchased this in early March 2020, it was extremely unstable because of the well known AMD driver issues which caused constant black screens among thousands of people. I was SO SO close to returning this thing because I had to endure these issues for a month asking myself ""Did I really just spend $300 on this piece of junk??"" Thankfully I hung in there for just a tad bit longer. Mid March I flashed the new VBIOS using MSI Live Updates and the black screens weren't as constant, but the issues still remained. Finally AMD released a new driver update mid March version 20.3.1 which seemed to fix the black screens and also addressed the known issues in the ""What's new"" portion of the driver update info.

Conclusion:

This is a 1080p killing machine! Great value for the money and can stand toe-to-toe against RTX 2060 Super but for about $100 less. Make sure to flash new VBIOS using MSI LIVE Updates and update to latest AMD drivers for RX 5600 XT."

- Very affordable and accurately priced @ > $300
- Very cool gpu. Stress tests with Kombuster/Userbenchmark couldn't push the gpu above 80c before OC crash.
- Adrenalin software is interesting/Very customizable with current updates (is finally stable)
- Freesync (significantly easier to find a nice monitor for this gpu as most monitors now have freesync)
- Lots of room for over clocking and pretty damn stable compared to Nvidia
- FPS is *pretty good for the price

Cons

- Very sharp/ grainy graphical style. (NVIDIA is known for being smooth and silky while this card is grainy and sharp in most games. This is not a bad thing if you're looking for the best FPS, but i try to build systems that look amazing and function amazing. This card is more of the side of ""function amazing"")
- Gets crushed by the 2060 super and fairly out done by the 2060. This is a half step down from the 2060 in my book.
- Time consuming for new PC builders to get settings dialed in. I've spent probably 4-5 hours getting this card dialed in - running DDU, driver updates, general card settings in adrenaline, monitor configuration etc. Much more tweaking needed compared to an NVIDIA card buy after everything is all said and done, i like the customization this card offers.
- Not particularly amazing but a good card. Can't run warzone on max settings without a lot of performance chopping, WoW at max settings performs around 65-75 fps. Was a little disappointed at first. HOWEVER on more customized graphics/settings in adrenalin you can push the image quality down and get significantly higher performance.

OVERALL (TLDR) - I'd give this card a 7/10 for value alone. Don't expect this card to handle everything you throw at it, but do expect this card to put up pretty good performance in most scenarios."

Anyway, I wanted to get a nice mid-range card for a new build and having purchased and used an MSI Z490 chipset to support an Intel Gen 10 Core i7, the 5600 XT Gaming seemed to fit just right.

Though out of my ""comfort zone"" for my new builds, I have been more than pleasantly surprised at the capabilities of this card. No issues with drivers, EZ install, games are no problem, 4K looks great with additional settings in the Radeon Software to enable 10-bit panel support, and so on...

Overclocking was much better before vbios update that ""made the card faster"" but gimped it from overclocking like before due to it being able to reach 5700 speeds. So the vbios limits how much you can overclock now artificially.

Design of the card is great and the fans keep it cool, most of the time the fans don't come on as not needed. I've only heard them at 100% once and that was since I set them to 100%, during gaming they come on at about 25%-50% speed and able to cool the card off.

No RGB on the card, I don't care for RGB but if you do then this one doesn't have it. If I had to do it over again I'd prob would have gotten the 5700 or waited for the new cards but I don't do 4k gaming so just went with what I needed."

The card wasn't showing up in the device manager when I got the rig fired up(make sure you get the card in the PCIe x16 slot 1... for my mobo it was the one that was recommend to work better for 2nd gen Ryzen CPU). Don't worry, just head to AMD's website and there is a section for this graphics card in the driver downloads. It was slightly confusing while trying to situate the drivers because I thought I needed to get them from the MSI website. The MSI website will just give you performance applications to monitor your beast. AMD will get you RADEON software that has Adrenaline that will push drivers to your AMD CPU and GPU.

Two caveats to consider, though:

1. It's deceptively large, measuring 297mm long, bigger than a lot of cards with 3 fans, even though it only has 2 fans. Make sure it fits in your case before you buy it.
2. Most RX 5600 XT's only need one 8-pin power connector, but this one needs two for some reason. Also, it needs the 7th and 8th pins to be connected, so plugging a 6-pin connector directly into it won't work even though it fits.

Wow. So, first I’m going to fill you in on what I’m using so you can make the call yourself.

Dell Optiplex 990
I5-2500 3.3Ghz
Windows 7 Professional 64 bit
16GB memory ( 4x4gb 10600 1333mhz sticks- all same brand/model)
250gb HD
Lenovo 24” monitor 1080p

Upgraded from a 2gig ddr3 card and wow what a difference. I have yet to play a game that I couldn’t max out the graphics settings! This GPU isn’t all that loud, I only hear it becaus I have my case open. The OC option is great, it gives it a nice bump, but haven’t really had to use it unless I wanted to feel spoiled. I’m new to gaming and people say this is a mid range card, but to be honest it pushes out WAY more crisp graphics than my x box one S. The responsiveness is also great. I have yet to see the GPU clock higher than 60C even when the OC option is on. I don’t see a reason for the $1k graphics cards too be honest. This has shown all the power I need! Not to mention it is running on the motherboard and stock power supply of 250 something!

Game played with ultra/max settings.

The Witcher 3
FIFA 18
Endless Space 2
Metal Gear Solid 5 phantom pain
Arkham Knight GOTY edition
Far cry primal

GTA 5 on mix of medium/high
GR Wildlands on high/ultra (using OC with some tweaks in bios) even though some features load slow ie. terrain

Edited to add some games I’ve played on this card since I bought it.

-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE:

So when I first got this card I was a bit of a newbie when it came to gaming. This card is still a very good card! If your worried about FPS, I'm sorry, unless you have a beefy system with matching ddr5 memory to add as vram to the card, you won;t get it. The above games I was playing at lower resolutions, with higher settings. I was originally playing with the stock PSU on my pc, but have upgraded recently to 550W PSU. It has made this decent card into a better performing card! With the new PSU I was able to push the card a lot harder when I overclock and it did make a huge difference in how fast the images were rendered in game. The current games I play are below:

These unlike the last review are all on full screen 1080p.

Ghost Recon: Wildands --- Mostly medium settings with ultra texture levels. Average:35-42 FPS
FrostPunk: ALL Ultra settings ---- 40 FPS almost constantly
FIFA 18: Ultra/Max settings ---- 50 FPS plus
Sims 4---Ultra/Max everything-- does it really matter? lol its Sims. Walk in the park even without overclocking.
Fallout 4 GOTY-----High/Ultra mix -- without MODS in game it did well 45-55 FPS, with mods about 35
Batman: Arkham Origins- Max settings 50-55fps
Witcher 3---Mostly Ultra but with a few off or on low---45-50 fps
Splinter Cell:Blacklist-------Ultra preset in game ----50 FPS
This War of Mine-----Ultra Settings----40-45fps
MGS V----Ultra Settings 50 fps SOLID\

The card I think with a strong PSU can take on MUCH more than it can with a stock PSU. I thought about upgrading to the 1060 for future proofing, but I just can't seem to justify it yet :)

Even with only 2 GB VRAM on the card, this this is handling what I throw at it well."
6.0,Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TD5-4GD),Gigabyte,Nvidia,7008 MHz,4 GB,$159.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,Decent graphics card that fits a HP 570 Series Pavilion PC!,"*This review is for the Geforce GTX 1050 Ti OC Low Profile 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TOC-4GL)*
I bought a small form factor HP 570-p064 (for $400) to be used for general, non-gaming use, but soon after I decided to upgrade the power supply and get the best graphics card that could fit in its cramped case. After hours of research, I found that the only card that would reasonably fit would be the Gigabyte GT 1030 -- a very flat, 2 GB GDDR5 card -- and I ordered it from Amazon for about $95.

So, I installed an EVGA uATX power supply and the card...But after less than a week of playing some old Steam games and demos, I was disappointed by how much it did not improve upon the integrated Intel HD 630 graphics. I believe I needed a 4 GB video card, although they were twice the size; it would be a miracle to find something that would work in a HP 570.

I just couldn't believe the GT 1030 could be the only option, but the PCI-E port is flanked by a power supply and a slimline DVD player. In addition, the motherboard's two yellow audio inputs are partially blocking the top graphics card slot -- a weird design choice. So, the prospect of installing any dual-slot, 4GB card would be limited by card length, height, and ""shape"": Basically, any ""blocky"" cards (like some of the EVGA models) longer than 6.8 inches would not work.

I thought that maybe this Gigabyte model would work, trying to measure and imagine it in my case. Well, I was lucky enough to find an obscure review from another HP 570 series purchaser (on another seller's website) who wrote that the Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti Low Profile graphics card ""barley fit."" It seemed that the length and height would be OK, and the sides might just perfectly angle near the front of the card to allow just enough space to clear the motherboard's audio inputs.

Well, I chatted with Amazon about the situation and they took care of anything -- FIVE STARS for customer service! They sent me a new 1050 Ti graphics card via free one-day shipping, and they said there would be no penalty if the card didn't fit. And they helped me return the GT 1030. Thank you Amazon once again!

I was very happy when my new GPU installed perfectly, and I got started sampling some games.

My HP 570-p064 only has an Intel i3 dual-core 7100 3.9GHZ processor with 8 GB DDR4 RAM. Windows 10 64-bit is on an SSD, and my games are installed on a 1 TB hard drive. I am limited to a 23"" 1080p 60 Hz monitor. Here are some of my in-game FPS results with the Gigabyte 1050 Ti OC -- with some slight overclocking -- using 1080p resolution:

- Grand Theft Auto V with high settings and some effects: 50-60 FPS average
- Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition with high settings: 60 FPS
- Final Fantasy: A Realm Reborn with high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Max Payne 3 with very high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Doom (2016) with max resolution and medium effects: 60 FPS
- Spec Ops: The Line (demo) with the highest settings: a solid 60 FPS
- Skyrim with ultra settings running high definition textures: 60 FPS

I hope this review helps anyone with an HP 570 series computer make a sizable graphics card upgrade. Although it's more of a casual gaming card, I believe it can play games on par -- or better in many cases -- than a regular PS4. Your success will largely depend on your processor, too, and I have an average Intel unit.

Please note you'll need a new power supply as this card draws 70 watts, and the stock 180-watt power supply will not work safely, if at all. I recommend the EVGA 500 watt White model. And if someone finds an even better GPU that fits an HP 570, please let the world know."

RGB works fine as long as you're not plugging it into a $20 motherboard. Anyway, this card gives me my frames and resolution, I'm happy. But remember, CPU has a big impact on your FPS performance, as well. So don't judge my frames just based off of the fact that I have this card (the 1050 G1 Gaming 2GB). I have an i5-7600k paired with this 1050.

Anyway, you get the jist. I got it for ~$40 less than it's listed at right now; so I'm definitely satisfied. Cheap and great for casual performance. 4 stars simply because of the inherent product quality, (it's just a 1050), and the fact that it's gone up ~$40. Would have given it 5 stars because of the great value to performance if it was still sitting at the cheaper price!"

The first card I purchased was a GeForce GT1030 2G, but only because the size of the computer didn't allow for a larger card. Then, I purchased the GT1050 Ti to test for upcoming builds and I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's get one big thing out of the way. This card is not top of the line and is not intended for serious gamers. Having said that, for beginners or someone that needs a decent upgrade from an integrated graphics card then this card is what I recommend.

I play a decent amount of Civilization V and City Skylines. On medium settings I'm averaging roughly 50 fps. Granted, I have a 500gb SSD, 1TB HDD and 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAM with an i5 processor. So, if you have less memory or a slower processor you may not get the same results. I'm betting if I doubled my RAM I could probably squeak out a bit more fps.

Seriously, if you're a newbie to gaming or just want an affordable upgrade to your current graphics, I recommend you take a look at this card. It does NOT require additional power and I run my card through a Dell desktop. Anyone that knows Dell computers knows that their PSUs don't have that much juice. However, after upgrading to a EVGA 600w PSU today, my fps went up slightly to around 55fps."

I installed it on my lunch break from work and still had plenty of time to eat and get a QP game in. I did take a star away due to the fan being pretty loud but it's not a dealbreaker for me since I use my headset most of the time."

It works at 1870 MHz (Core) and 3504 MHz (memory) from the box. Was able to overclock it to 1930 MHz (core) and 4504 MHz(memory). It is enough to play almost all games on ultra settings. Though, on 1080p monitors, in some games, you will have to reduce some options as filtering/shadows in order to get 60 fps (e.g. in the Witcher 3). Use it w/ i5-7500, 8GB Crucial 2400 MHz and 120GB Transcend SSD.
In conclusion: good enough for 1080p monitors. If you cannot afford going for higher GPUs like RX 470 or GTX 1060, but this GPU. In my case, I use this GPU with 900p monitor and it provides a comfortable gaming at 60-90 fps w/ ultra setting in heavy games like GTA V, Battlefield 1, Witcher 3, Assasins Creed and others."

I thought I might have a tough time finding something to upgrade it with because the power supply is only 240W and it's a very ""special"" one that has a special shape and can't be upgraded... unless I were to move everything into a new case and I'm not that confident in my abilities. Anyway, installing this wasn't that hard to do because it fits very well and the AORUS software used to control it is nice and easy to use. Everything I've thrown at it so far has worked wonderfully. Of course not all of the most recent games will work of course.

The only thing that I didn't like was that I was sent an email after purchase for the ""Fortnite Bundle"" and while I don't play it, I thought I'd give it a try after redeeming the code they sent me....Well...the code had already been redeemed and Nvidia told me the email that redeemed it and it looked to be a Russian email that had redeemed it weeks before I even purchased this. They told me to contact Amazon for a new code. I did just that and the support was awful. They kept transferring me back and forth over 10 times and basically told me to contact ""the developer"" which I asked them to clarify and they said to contact Gigabyte. I did THAT and was told to contact Amazon or Nvidia. So that was all pointless. If you're buying this for an upgrade, go for it. If you're buying this and you want the Fortnite promotion, you won't get it which is pretty scummy if you ask me."

The plan was to code on one and review documents, specs on the other. Plugged into the system and powered up. Fan on Graphics card was operational, but the screens remained black for several minutes. Eventually the screens turned off due to 'No Signal'. Tried 3 different HDMI cables and the DVI cable, with no luck.

Then I got the idea to plug one of the monitors into the onboard VGA cable and verified the OS was booted. Opened the device manager and saw the card was not compatible with the Microsoft Basic Video Driver. Loaded the drivers from the CD that came with the product and all seemed good. The driver CD required a reboot to complete installation and here is where the problem began.

Upon reboot, Windows 10 crashed due to corrupted files. Rebooted twice with the same problem. Finally Windows executed the automatic recovery which removed the Video card drivers. Once I booted into Windows, I tried again, but this time I downloaded the driver straight from the Website. Upon reboot, Windows reported corrupted files and crashed. This time, the automatic recovery program could not recovery and my whole OS was corrupted. I spent a day and a half reinstalling the OS, the drivers, the updates, and all the programs I had lost on my system.

Tech support was no help. Even asked if I had the outlet plugged into the desktop and the system was powered up. I decided to just return the item to Kohl's for a refund."

While the card itself is good, I've wasted an hour trying to get the bonus. I received an email from Amazon with a code and web link. I followed the link, had to give lots of personal information to create an account at GeForce, to finally get to the proper page. After entering the very long code and the ""I'm not a robot"" validation, it gave a cryptic message ""Please use GeForce Experience 3.17 to redeem this promo code. You can download it at <redacted link at NVIDIA>. I have no idea what that is, why I need it, or why I wasn't sent there to begin with. So, I went to *that* link, downloaded it, went through a time-consuming install, which *seemed* to complete. Then I started it (but it seems to report it as an older version 3.10.x, although Add/Remove programs only shows 3.6.0.74) and (after quite a wait) it reported another useless message of ""NVIDIA Installer failed"" and a link for ""Need help troubleshooting?""

When I go to *that* link, I get an Amazon page displaying 129 items that reference ""Fortnite bundle"" ... no help at all for anything related to my issue.

So, if you want a video card, consider this only as if you won't get any bonus with it. I've lost way too much time trying to get the ""bonus"". It's not worth it."

I monitored heat, ran GPU burner programs, tried different drivers to no avail. The heat plateaus off at safe levels; the GPU programs cannot replicate the issues; the behavior doesn't change with different driver versions or different games. Currently, I am trying to work with Gigabyte for warranty replacement on both cards. Yes, both cards.

Update 1/25/2019:
I received both cards back from Gigabyte --untouched-- with a packing list (yes, packing list; nothing else) that hinted both cards were out of region. When I submitted the cards for RMA, they stated only one was out of region. Now they say BOTH are out of region. Their 3-year warranty is absolute crap when they won't stand by their product. I will throw these in the trash and go a different brand. You have been warned."

Its a simple upgade!","First off lets look what I'm using this in: A old Walmart ""box"" Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer. With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.

Playing what would be considered ""simple single and multi-player games"" with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.

Well this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking ""CPU"" power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now ""booking"" on all my games and simulators!

The GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.

I currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.

So far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.

All in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer.

Installed in about 5 minutes,"Got the card today and working great. Installed in about 5 minutes. Probably would of installed quicker but I spent about 2 minutes looking for the pin jacks for the power supply. (someone in the Q&A said that this card (with 2 fans has to be plugged into the power supply). It doesn't. No connections anywhere on card for separate power supply connection on the card , the whole thing is powered just by sliding it into the PCI e slot. When I first installed the card and turned on PC it used a generic windows driver for about 5 minutes until windows update immediately downloaded and installed the driver from Nvida. One thing, the driver that Windows 10 pulled was pretty old and out of date so you will most certainly want to download the software and run it. I just googled the card name, took me right to their website where you can download a program from Nvida called (GeForce Experience) that will auto detect your card, and download the very latest driver, you can also select in the settings to auto update the driver as new versions come out.

Ran some stress tests on it (not very long about 10 minutes or maybe less, but temp of the card never went over 64 degrees C which is very good. Stress test is designed to push the card to the limits and if the card doesn't run super hot your in good shape. Runs at a steady 32-33 degrees in my computer when not gaming and just using internet and basic windows programs.

Overall I think this card is great value for mid range gaming on the newest games, and any of the older favorites should run at top settings. Also this card has sound drivers built in. Which kind of shocked me. My old card didn't and I was using headphones for the longest time. I was kind of shocked when all the sudden my monitor started having sound come out of it. I didn't even know my monitor had speakers built in to be honest.lol"

It has taken all of them with no problem. It even plays 4k Netflix, which is the main reason I bought it.

The hardest part of the install was having to re-route some cabling in my HTPC case. Other than that, it's simple. I didn't even have to plug in additional power, it works off the mainboard as long as your power supply has enough juice.

Update 05/25/19: Occasionally, and randomly, the display blinks (goes black for a moment). Some videos it's horrible, others it's a couple times at most. There isn't any specific pattern, and is not easily duplicated. Apparently I'm not the only person with this issue, per other reviews.

Finally in January of this year I sent the card in, hoping they'd fix or replace it, but it was returned with the note that they couldn't find a problem.

All I wanted was a reliable low-profile graphics card that would fit in my slim PC case. What I got was a lemon that's been nothing but a pain from the beginning. It works, but only just enough to get my hopes up before eventually flickering, going black, and requiring yet another reboot."

I use it for gaming. I'm not a framerate zealot so keep that in mind.
I left the HW settings at default so far, so as not to cook everything before it's time.
I haven't noticed the fan at all and running the utility shows it taking my gaming load in stride.
I replaced an R9 380 3G with this and the 8G memory lets me use better settings and stuff sparkles for a month or so till I adjust and start dreaming of the next GPU upgrade on a limited budget. :)

I always choose as much ram as possible for my budget for PC's and GPU's when selecting.
I had medium/high expectations(within reason) and it delivered. I'm a happy camper.
I got way more than I had, at less than I spent for the R9 a while ago. ""Ohhhhh shiny!"" :)

EDIT: 2019 March 1.
I removed 3 stars because the ""RX 580"" has serious issues @ 4k across all brands.

I have 2 Intel Z77 mobo's that do 4k@60Hz no problem on my display.
The RX 580 in my Intel Z77 mobo's causes POST errors. I wish I had checked that out first!
I have an Intel H390 mobo that does 4k@60Hz no problems.
I have an AMD R9 380X 3G that does 4k@60Hz no problem.
I can't even get 4k@30Hz, 1/2 of what is advertised, many others complain about 'only 4k@30Hz'.
I have tried lots of different cables after searching the net for answers, no go.
I have beefy power supplies in everything, it's NOT a power issue.
Evidently I am now among the growing hoard of unhappy RX 580 customers.

If you are lucky, as some are, you MAY get 4k @ 30Hz out of it.
If all you want/need is 1080P and have no immediate plans for a UHD/4k monitor, it works OK.

It's also much easier to find, and cheaper to buy the monitors that go with AMD ""freesync"" I believe is it's name, than to try and find a nice monitor with G-Sync, and I'm a sucker for a 35"" ultra wide!! I can't even play on a normal 16:9 anymore

This may not be a popular opinion... and I don't know if it's the type of games I play or what, but I get comparable game benchmarks using a rx580 8gig paired with a RYZEN 17x or 18X, as I do with 8th gen I7 with a GTX 1070 (founders edition). The latter usually comes out a little ahead but not by a noticeable amount, and it darn well BETTER come out ahead! those components are almost twice the price. I do get more screen tearing on the harder games with the nVidia even if the FPS is a little higher due to all my monitors being AMD friendly. Personally id rather have average's in the 50-60 FPS with NO screen tearing, than 60-80 FPS with noticeable tearing"

If you are worried about temperatures, they are not great, but not had either. The fan runs no higher than around 40% under a decent load for me, and is fairly quiet. When the card is idle, the temperature is around 54°C and under load gets to a maximum of around 77°C.(measured using msi afterburner.) If you want to lower the temps, you can always increase fan speed, at the cost of a bit of noise(it gets loud when the fans are anywhere over 45%) and will easily keep it in the 60°c-65°c under load.

GAMING::: it's great, you should easily stay above 60 fps in modern AAA games no problem, turning the settings down will let you get 144 fps and up(what I use with my 144hz monitor)

I recommend this card if you are on a budget, want to play new AAA titles, and are okay with some noise under heavy loads."

All 3 monitors are running beautifully, I also have the Pro drivers installed for Opencl support in Darktable and GIMP. They are running faster and smoother.

Wow, what can I say but wow, amazing upgrade to my now 6 year old custom build PC. Spent less than $200 (after pending rebate) for a major increase in graphics performance (coming from a GTX 670 which was a top performer in its class when I bought it years ago lol). Very nice looking and sturdy gpu that runs more quiet than any of my older cards. Bought it mainly so that I could run my new LG Ultrawide 3440 x 1440 monitor with no worries (working magically so far!), and then discovered the amazingness that is 21:9 gaming! I've seen a few videos on it but never really intended that for this card, but just wow, the higher level of immersion that I am experiencing at 3440 x 1440 is just incredible, and this card runs at that resolution for Final Fantasy XV (demo) with no issues, and I feel looks a lot better than I remember it when I played the game on PS4 ^_^. My large and mostly unplayed library of Steam games are old and pretty much NO game will even tax this card, thus downloading the Final Fantasy XV demo.

AMD FreeSync looks nice, too, given your monitor supports it. This card is an excellent value and will give you the most fps if you have $200 to spend on a card.

Cons: Imagine you put a horse saddle on a Boeing 747 jet engine and tried it ride it around your house... That's what noise this card makes. Okay, maybe not as loud as a jet but let's just say I can walk in other rooms of my house and still hear the thing. On a moderate overclock, it's very loud. On stock settings, it's still loud, but bearable. I don't think my card is defective, just doesn't have a heat sync up to par with a card like the Gaming X. Other than this, the card sags a tiny bit. You can remedy this by routing it's 8 pin power cable from above instead of below - that's what I did.

Overall, it's a great card if you can handle the noise. I think I'm going to return it and bump my card budget up to $300 to get something a bit quieter. If your budget is firm at $200, though, go ahead and jump on this card - the noise can be gotten used to and you won't regret the performance you get."

The only problem I have had with this card is heat, a lot of people have a problem with that and it's a simple solution, upgrade from an mATX case to a full ATX case.

I fiddled with it and managed to get almost everything to Very High with disabling things I don't care for too much like sunshaft quality, shadow quality, etc., and am still running around idling with a 95-100 FPS. In 25man raids it drops to about 80. Mind you, this is with an ancient cpu and very low ram.

As far as the card itself is concerned, besides being a massive upgrade, it doesn't have any pin connectors or anything, you just slot it home and that's it. Its silent, has a fan/heatsync combo, and stays nice and cool after hours of raiding. It has the option for overclocking, but I just don't need it with WoW. And WoW is also known to be rather demanding when you crank the settings all the way up. I also play Dreadnaught at max settings across the board.

Amazing little card that can breath fresh life into a 6 y.o rig!"
8.0,Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,6008 MHz,2 GB,$84.49,4.5 out of 5 stars,Easily one of the best sub-$100 GPU on the market!,"I purchased this to upgrade my older rig- while my ""main"" PC is in my office, my ""old"" PC is in my living room- so it does get quite a lot of use. I tend to play fairly easy-to-run games on the PC in question, but even still, the MSI R7 250 2GB DDR3 inside was struggling.

Fable Anniversary could barely pull down 30FPS on medium settings. Wolfenstein The New Order/The Old Blood would be at 25-30FPS on low/medium settings. Even Crusader Kings II, Hearts of Iron III/IV, and Stellaris ran at sub-60FPS on low/medium settings.

I purchased the GT 1030 to remedy these faults, and boy, was I not disappointed. 60+ FPS on Fable Anniversary on max settings. Steady 55-60FPS on Wolfenstein on max (okay, very close to max) settings. Paradox games went from a 20-25FPS to well over 70. I was quite shocked by the latter.

To wrap up my review of its performance- let's talk over clocking. Once (basic) drivers are installed via the included CD, a built in clock control program is also installed. It is easier to use than Afterburner, having safe presets- but does not allow for as much control until specifically placed in ""professional"" mode. Otherwise, the clock speeds are just fine for a 69 dollar card. On top of that, the VRAM is DDR5- a massive upgrade for those still running DDR3 VRAM.

As to the more physical nature of the card- wow, is it tiny. Less than half the size of my replaced R7 250, probably a quarter of the size of the 1070 in my main computer. Far lighter as well.

Installation was simple, as it only draws power directly from the PCI slot/motherboard. Speaking of power- this thing barely draws any. Can't recall exactly, but I know that it's a minuscule amount. As long as you have a 300-350W power supply, you'll be fine.

Be warned- given the size, this card only produces ONE DVI port and ONE HDMI port. That's it. Just something to think about. I was a bit surprised they didn't put a VGA slot on a card NVIDIA is touting as the answer to every budget gamer's needs- but I digress. I suppose even HDMI-sporting monitors/TVs are cheap nowadays.

Card is whisper silent, although the first time I installed it, it spun hard and fast for a few minutes, and made considerable noise- don't freak out if that happens. She has great thermals, but I do have an overkill cooling setup in this PC, so results there are probably skewed for the average person who isn't obsessed with cooling.

Anyways, a $69, low-profile, Pascal-based, NVIDIA GPU? It's not too good to be true. Give it a shot if you're on a budget, have power or size restrictions,or even if you're just an NVIDIA or GPU enthusiast. It won't replace your 1070, but it will definitely surprise you- especially given its small form factor and low power draw.

Just a quick side note before I stop rambling- don't ask me how but- I'm pretty positive NVIDIA will be releasing a GT 1040 soon, perhaps by the end of the year. For those that aren't in a rush- perhaps wait for that?"

ESO, SWTOR, WOW, LOL, D3 all on max settings with good frame rate. (60fps or much greater in most cases)
I have played Witcher 3, GTA 5 and a couple other titles on med settings at 50fps or greater. If you are looking for a particular game, go to YouTube and search gt 1030 and the name of the game. It's the best bang for your buck low profile card available imo."

This computer is used 99% for basic office tasks, watching YouTube, and minimal gaming. The PC has on-board video which was fine for normal office tasks, but it maxed out at HD resolution (approximately 1920x1080). I eventually upgraded to a 4K monitor, but my computer's built-in video couldn't handle that resolution, so I needed to find a very small video card that was powerful enough to support a 4K monitor.

I tried an older card that I'd used with a 2.7K monitor, but it was terrible -- that card was constantly crashing and causing all sorts of problems....it literally wouldn't allow me to watch full-screen videos.

After looking around on Amazon, I found this Gigabyte card and decided to give it a try. So far, it's been basically perfect. First, it fit into my PC's very small case (the case is very narrow so a ""normal"" height video card won't fit). Second, after a simple install and setup, the card has been running perfectly -- zero crashes or other problems.

Although my PC is not really used for gaming, I've tried running some really old favorites (Counter-Strike, etc.) and everything seems to run great. That isn't surprising given how old the games I'm playing are, but still -- so far this card has been fast and smooth with everything I've thrown at it. Pretty impressive given the low price.

One other comment -- this card does have a fan, but it appears to be completely silent. My PC is very quiet anyway, but I can't hear the video card's fan running at all.

P.S. One additional thing -- getting 4K/60Hz resolution on my monitor did not require any special cables....I just used an old HDMI cable I had sitting around and this worked fine. This is yet another bonus point since some monitors require different/special cables to achieve the highest resolution & refresh rates, but that fortunately wasn't the case here."

I did plenty of research looking for something that would work for my particular rig: I picked up an old(er) HP Elite 8200 SFF with Intel i5-2400 3.1 Ghz processor, and 8 GB RAM for pretty cheap from the IT department at work, and it had a GT 310 installed which was barely able to run SWTOR on low settings (30-40 fps). I was worried about finding something that would fit the SFF tower and would run on the stock ~240W power supply (didn't have the budget to upgrade both). Even though this card recommends min. 300W power supply, I researched the specs and it draws the same amount of power as the GT 310, so I felt safe giving it a shot. Plus, I don't have much else running off the PSU so my total power needs are relatively low. Installation of the hardware was easier than expected (yes, it includes the low-profile bracket which was necessary for the SFF tower), and the software installation was as simple as booting up the computer after installing the graphics card and running the CD. It took about 20 minutes to install all the programs and drivers and was ready to go. I am now playing SWTOR on Ultra settings at 1600x1200 resolution with a framerate of 80-90 fps. I was able to temporarily plug into a different monitor and play on a slightly modified Very High settings (reduced AA, but not off) getting 60-70 fps at 1920x1080. I don't have a need to play the most recent games, just some sorta-oldies-but-definitely-goodies (I will be trying out Skyrim soon, and I have no doubts it will run fine on High settings). I have to say that this card is really great for the price and an outstanding choice for an entry-level graphics card for gamers on a budget."

I have a Dell Inspiron 3656 which is a small form factor case with a proprietary 240 watts power supply. I wanted to upgrade from the on board GPU, but quickly discovered that there were few options. In fact it was either an older card from several years back or this one, the Geforce GT 1030. I went with the Gigabytes card because of the fan which makes it a thinner card more suitable for my small case.

This card has exceeded my expectations. Before installing the new card I ran 'winstat formal', a built in benchmark in Windows 7 thru 10. The on board GPU scored just 5.1 for graphics. After installing the Geforce GT 1030 I ran winstat again. This time the graphics score was 8.1 (on a scale of 1-9.9 in Windows 10). I am now able to play two year old games at 1080 with high graphics settings. This is not a true gaming card and I am sure if I had tried to play something like Witcher 3 I would have had to scale things down a bit. In Kerbal Space Program I am able to play a moderately modded game with thirty part ships at about 30-40 fps. At this point my CPU is the bottle neck.

Another point I want to stress, because I think it is important, is that the fan over my APU no longer kicks in. When I would first start my computer or launch a ship in Kerbal Space Program, the fan would roar up to full speed to keep the APU cool, but after installing the GT 1030, it does not. The APU is running much much cooler, which is a very good thing. I could probably overclock the system now, which Gigabytes makes very easy with its utility.

The fan on the Gigabyte GT 1030 is really very quiet, not much above ambient room noise. This make the card a perfect choice for a small form factor low wattage HTPC. You would never hear it above the sounds in the 4k movie you are watching. I can not hear it above the sound produced by my heater.

If you have a Dell or HP computer with a small form factor case and low wattage power supply, this is the perfect upgrade to eek out a couple more years out of your system. Or, if you want to reuse your older computer as a HTPC capable of watching 4k videos, this card will do it for you."

For $75 the GT1030 was a good value option considering GT 730 and 710 were selling for approx $65\60. Installation was easy and simple. I used online drivers, but the box does include a driver disc. This particular card does not feature a VGA port so please be aware. Also the card comes with both the full and half size brackets but mine did require swapping out the installed bracket since I installed this card into a slim case.

Greetings everyone,

In Part 1 we will show the result of noise testing, and in Part 2 we will note what this special unique card is best suited for.

PART #1: SUMMARY OF NOISE TESTING:
-----------------------------------------------

GOAL:

We want the fan to keep the Graphics Card GPU at or under 82-87C. This is 10-15C cooler than the max GPU temp (Tmax).

TEST ENVIRONMENT:

- SMALL COMPUTER CASE with lots of air venting (a worst case case for noise)
- NO OTHER FANS in the case other than CPU fan
- GPU at 100% load

RESULTS:

(1)
33%-50% fan speeds all result in 79C, nearly silent 2'+ away
55% fan speed result in 78C, and still quiet enough for under desk
65% fan speed result in 75C, Audible 4'+ away, OKish under desk
75% fan speed result in 70C, Audible 4'+ away, audible under desk
80% fan speed is MUCH noisier than even 75%

(2)
I CHOSE TO MOSTLY RUN AT 33% fan speed (lowest settable) since at 79C we are still well under the 82-87C goal. At that fan speed it is INAUDIBLE UNDER THE DESK.

33% Fan Speed translates to 1,940-2,090 RPM.

Side Note:
I would think in a mostly enclosed case it would be mostly silent on desk at 33% fan speed.

(4)
DON'T use AUTO to set fan speed as it prioritizes temperature over any concern for noise. AUTO can result in extremely high fan speed (ex: 85%) even when entirely unnecessary.

Instead use MANUAL or even better CUSTOMIZED.

CUSTOMIZED is set using the free GIGABYTE AORUS engine application (it's quite simple to use). I set customized as follows:
- 33% fan speed (lowest possible) until 82C
- 55% fan speed 83C-87C
- 95% fan speed 88C-100C

(5)
Remember that a video card pegged at GPU 100% load can generate different heat profiles depending on what it is doing, such as different games and workloads. It's not always the same heat profile even at a fixed GPU 100% load. Thus, 33% fan speed may or may not be adequate for your particular needs.

(6)
Based on all of this, if your new GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 card is quite noisy at low fan speeds like 55% fan speed then you may have a lemon and should exchange it. You will be doing GIGABYTE a favor, they have no desire that lemons make it to the customer.

SPECIAL FAN SPEED NOTES:

In case max fan speed or fan speed % calculations change, here are the RPMs found associated with different % fan speeds on this card.

% _____ RPM
----------------
33% ___ 1,940-2,090
35% ___
40% ___ 2,090
45% ___ 2,250
50% ___ 2,500
55% ___ 2,750
60% ___ 3,000
65% ___ 3,250
70% ___ 3,500
75% ___ 3,750

PART #2: WHAT'S THIS CARD BEST FOR?
-----------------------------------------------

What's special about this card is how remarkably skinny and short it is given its graphics power (SINGLE SLOT, LOW PROFILE). This allows a whole different level of graphics power for many small cases that couldn't otherwise fit anything near its graphics capability.

If you have a bit more space, such as double-slot or standard profile height, you might consider instead using FANLESS GT 1030 options, or for a bit more money up the graphics power a bit and go for at least the GeForce GT 1050 level cards or its AMD equivalents.

Keep in mind this card has 2 GB on it, which is plenty for many uses but can be quite limiting for some more demanding uses like video editing.

Hope that helps!

Best Regards,
Neil"

Hardly any heat, and little no noise compared to the HD 7750!

The PC is an HP 510-p026. This PC had a 180watt power supply. I tried this card and it did not work do to the power-supply being to weak. Not to worry. I replaced this power supply with a 300 watt I had from another PC. Now the GT 1030 is running. I have been using this card for the past 4 months with no issues. I am running the card in a small case regular height. This card does come with a slim bracket for slim PC's. I like that card has a fan on it to keep it cooler while gaming. I use NZXT's CAM software to monitor temps while I play some games. GPU temp has never been higher the 60C under full load. It idles between 24 and 27C.
This card is not meant to play AAA titles at max settings. This is a budget friendly card meant to play e sports games and older games. If you want to get off you Intel integrated graphics this is the best card to start with for under $100.00.

It was an older dell optiplex (790) that are filling the shelves in our IT's storage room as the office gets upgraded. It's a small form factor case. It has a second generation i5 and 8GB ram. I didn't really have a use for it, but I thought it would be fun to see what a super-budget-friendly graphics card could do in a free computer. Honestly, I couldn't be more impressed. Since this is a current model, it has up-to-date drivers and supports the latest DirectX. so far, I've tested AC Syndicate, GTA V, Project Cars II, Dirt Rally and Fallout 4. All games perform flawlessly on recommended settings (low to medium). Though it does seem the recommended settings are a bit conservative for this card. I was able to turn them up a bit past the recommended settings with good results.

Besides performance, I was happy with how easy to install it was. The computer came with a 240W power supply, which is actually enough to power this card through the PCIe slot. Being low profile, it also fits perfectly in the small form factor case. I'm amazed at what I'm able to play on this $90 build (the only thing I bought was this graphics card)."

Gave one to my grandson for video games. Bought the GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 which after some research seems to be a low budget good video card. I took some time before testing it. When my son tested it, he informed me that the video will hang randomly and even with the computer (Windows) up and working. The only way to fix it was by rebooting the workstation. After re-installing Windows 10 from scratch I gave it to my grandson. He complained about the same situation. I took it back and spent more than a week researching and testing many suggestions to fix the problem. Installed a new NVME PCIe 240GB SSD which was quite FAST (about 4 times faster than a SATA SSD). In my tests (I'm not a video gamer) seems to be good. But once give it back to my grandson the same behavior began again. After several days of tying and error, I decided to install it in my other workstation which has an Intel i5 PROC, 500GB NVME PCIe Intel SSD and a second SATA 240GB SSD. After a little while, the system started to hang again and as before it will send a message that it has no video. Reboot the workstation and started to work again until it will hang again. Spent several more days and even clean the SSD and reinstall Windows 10 from scratch again, but for no avail. That is when I decided to contact the manufacturer, GIGABYTE. They sent me an RMA confirmation and today I mailed it back (had to pay $12 shipping from my pocket). I will update this review once GIGABYTE answers me for a solution."

Well I can say this...I decided that I would Install games like Need for Speed: The Run, Need for Speed: Rivals, and Sonic Generations. Not exactly super intensive games, but enough to try to test the card. Well, I will tell you that the card handled these games for the most part at the highest settings. NFS The Run ran flawlessly at the highest settings, NFS Rivals ran fine with a few hiccups here and there (when the environment got super detailed and several AI were on screen) and Sonic Generations ran flawlessly on the highest settings. Of course, it is now after Christmas and the kids have been playing fortnite, minecraft, league, and all sorts of other games without any issues.

Maybe I got a bad card, but while running in Hillsbrad foothills down the road I noticed every so often my toon would slow down like with a tiny hesitation. I lowered my settings to the lowest and it did the same. Tried a lot of different settings and areas...and always random slowing down while moving.

I thought maybe it was my 300 watt power supply so I installed it into my larger desktop with a 400w PS. Same thing...slight hesitation while running every few seconds. Went to Org and same thing...even with nobody around.

Installed a 750ti and had no issues on either PC. I reinstalled my older hd7750 and still no issues at all on either PC.

Like I said, maybe I got a bum card. I stuck it in my HTPC and using it at 720p resolution for popcorn time and seems to be working. 1080p stutters a bit.

Basically disappointed as it is super quiet and I really wanted to upgrade my hd7750 and get rid of its fan noise.
I do not suggest Gigabyte 1030 gt. Also include software will aorua what ever software that is included because will crash your PC during install. Don't try it.

Primary cause was not clear cut - some said PSU, some said MB, some said HD, etc.
I figured that since the power was on, HD was spinning, and blue LEDs were on in the case, it had to be the onboard video.

Not wanting to waste $40 on an underpowered older GPU, I opted for this GT 1030.
It's not for major gaming, but for my 4k television monitor and my TOS stock charts with real time data (18 small charts at once), it seemed to be what was needed as those two factors do require some processing power and memory.

I initially installed it on the lower (blue) PCI slot of the motherboard...nothing.
I moved this card to the upper (blue) PCI slot, and VOILA! I get Windows! (albeit initially at 1080p max due to Windows' VGA drivers).

The item came in it's GIGABYTE package undamaged.
New tape was on the tab.
New tape was on the electroprotective package.
It also had plastic covers on the terminals and 2 ports.
It was missing a manual and maybe a driver disc, but all I needed to do was download it off of GIGABYTE's website and install. Upon driver install completion, I was asked to reboot. On reboot, 4k resolution instantly appeared.

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
I'm happy with the ""open box"" price as well.
Delivered in 2 days and I didn't have to spend the gas to drive over to Microcenter or Best Buy, both of whom had similar prices for new. But for this aging machine, a few bucks saved is a few bucks earned."

The packaging from gigabyte isn't anything amazing but with low end cards I wouldn't expect them to be. Used this card for a client, for mainly home theatre use and light gaming. It runs quiet, comes with half height bracket, and to be honest when you are used to using bigger mainstream gaming video cards it's kind of adorable. This video card won't play the newest AAA games but, it will work better than integrated graphics and is really aimed at home theatre use. Somewhat comparable to the 750ti but with half the power consumption, I would recommend this in a pre-built system with a proprietary power supply like a dell 3650 or similar that doesn't require a power connection."

This has to be the sleeper video card of the year. A low profile silent card constantly being compared to cards that require a 6 pin line. This card draws it's power from the pci-e slot. No 6 pin requirements. My old card, an hd6750 needed a 6 pin at 85 watts. Most 6 pin cards require between 55 - 90+ watts to operate. This card needs only 35 watts. And it holds it's own very well. Even at 1080 resolution with medium settings, this card can play anything. Smoothly. Low profile, silent, and budget friendly. If you can afford this card, the decision to purchase it is a no brainer. Do your research and you will keep ending up at this card. This card gets no love in reviews but, as an exclusive AMD card user, this card has made me an Nvidia fan. Indulge your gaming self on a budget. Get this card.

It works great and installed smoothly. Normally Nvidia's Linux support is lacking, but it started working perfectly after installing the Nvidia 381 driver and a quick restart on Mint 18.1 (Ubuntu 16.04). It plays all my games fine, though some of them I have to turn the graphics down a bit to keep a solid 60fps, but with how cheap this graphics card is, I was expecting that. It's definitely worth it for anyone trying to keep a low budget on a gaming desktop or HTPC."

I really enjoy how it is dead silent, and the performance to cost ratio is extremely impressive. It can run Skyrim Special Edition at a consistent 60fps on the low graphics preset at 1080p, and can squeeze 120fps out of Synthetik: Legion rising at 1440p. I also tested Borderlands 3 and mostly stayed at 60fps on low at 540p (Better than the Nintendo Switch can do with a lot of games). Outside of gaming (this card isn't really meant for gaming anyway), this card can very comfortably handle your daily computing needs at any reasonable resolution, and for the price they're asking, it's a no-brainer as a backup card or as a pick-me-up for a rig with integrated graphics."

The 560 was always hot, averaging around 140 Fahrenheit under load and the fans were always spun up and noisy. I've never run an ASUS card before the brand is reputable, has been around a long time and the current demand for GPU's for crypto mining has raised prices prett much across the board.

The specs between the 560 and this 1030 card are nearly identical with each a little higher in an area or two. That being said, this card runs cool, around 110 Fahrenheit under load, it uses very little power (powered by the card slot), it is so quiet I cant hear it running over the other fans in the case.

Performance is spot on, equal to the 560 at the very least but I think it's noticeably better performing for the games it's used for (World of Tanks, TF2, etc.). Benchmarking tools (cat zilla, EVGA OC Scanner X) show better performance as well. It's only pushing a pair of 19"" monitors but I expect it could handle decent frame rates on 23"" monitors as well.

I got the card for $129 and for that or less I'd say its a great buy for a budget card."

I love the case, but its ventilation, despite 4 fans, and a vented top, has always been a problem with all but 35W Intel processors with built-in graphics (I was using an i7-4785T). On low graphics settings, there was too much banding, and on higher settings, there was stuttering of the video.

With the GT1030 card, I was able to use the highest video settings and increase debanding in MadVR to ""High."" The picture quality was much better, and the card is of course silent.

Unfortunately, the case could not tolerate the excess heat, and the hard drives went from under 40 degrees C to 50 degrees C. Turning up the case fans to compensate resulted in unacceptable noise.

In a case with better ventilation, this card would make a great replacement for a Haswell iGPU. In the end, I bought a Ryzen 5 3400G and B450 motherboard, and used the built-in graphics of the Ryzen. The results are as good as the GT1030/Intel combination, and power consumption is the same as that combination."

Coupled with a core i3-8500k, it's a great system for what I need. People typically want more than they need for gaming - especially old PC games - while I'm from the school of thought 'don't pay for what you don't need'. The latest GPUs are so dang powerful, that even the entry GT1030 here is a better performer than the x50Ti from a couple years ago. I am able to run FSX at max settings, with several scenery add-ons, at a fixed 40fps no problem. Best of all, no dedicated power connector is required; I have plenty of room for spare, even when OC'ing, with a 400W power supply. Another area that a lot of people go overkill on. My only wish is that the 1030s came with a 4GB option. Additional graphics memory comes in handy for all the scenery add-ons in FSX. But for the price, it's hard to complain."

I tried to install the drivers before changing the card, but it could not install because it did not find the hardware.
I installed the card and, at first power up, it loaded the generic MS video driver so I could have the screen working.
After that I installed the Nvidia driver supplied with the DVD, v 24.21.13.9764 dated 5/7/2018 and everything came up fine.
I then checked online for the latest driver and it installed v 24.21.13.9924 dated 9/5/2018.
The only issue I see is that NVIDIA no longer supports Miracast (WiDi), it tries to connect to a WiDi TV and disconnects immediately. I have other machines that work with WiDi but they have Intel Display Adapters.
With the AMD Radeon R9 270 I could connect only using an older driver v 22.19.172.769 dated 6/27/2017.
Any newer driver was failing and disconnecting from WiDi on first attempt.

But comparing the two, the asus geforce gt 1030 is way much better in all department, and that includes doubling the frame rates in games. Of course this GPU may lag behind the latest models and expensive gaming video cards, but having this installed in my computer is a very good improvement over all. Its plug n play, doesn't consume much power and very stable in a 300W stock power supply !! ..so no need to buy a new PSU.

I got the model with the heatsink only(no fan) and it runs cool in basic games like CSGO. Now my pictures looks good, videos and movies are visually striking crisps.

The individuals rating this one star quite possible did not know what in the world they were buying, were being cheap and simply bought the most affordable ""GPU"" or who knows what.. Let me just say that their reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.

The day this was announced I was ecstatic, this was the exact GPU I was in search of for quite a while. 4 HDMI outputs, Zero display ports, Zero Type-C ports, Zero VGA ports. JUST HDMI. Thats what I needed, ASUS delivered.

Let me give you a run down on my set up.. I have an Micro-ATX asrock x570 TB3, Ryzen 9 3950X, 32GB RAM and an RTX 20080. If you're knowledgeable on the Motherboard you'd know it only has one PCIE port. which is utilized by the 2080 GPU. I have this 710 connected via Thunderbolt 3. WHAAAT?! I have four 4K TV's connected to the 710 through TB3, downscaled to 1080P and 30 hertz. It runs like butter. The TV's are used for security camera feeds of 4 different sites running on Blue Iris. I offload all the video conversion/transcoding onto the 2080 as intended and utilize the 710 for its sole purpose, displaying static video. Thats exactly what this GPU is for, not for gaming, not for office work, rather for static imagery such as billboards, a wall of TV's, surveillance, etc. Dont expect this GPU to do any transcoding or high refresh rate situations.

The second unit I have is being used as interim as I await the delivery of another graphics card, GTX 1080. It powers, with no issue, an LG 3440 x 1440 34"" ultra wide monitor with 21:9 ratio. Again, zero issues with the operation. I dont game on the PC yet until I get the true GPU in.

You cant compare apples to apples here, this GPU has 192 CUDA cores, in comparison my 1080 has well over 1900 CUDA cores. Know what you are buying, Know what you will be using this GPU for. For me, this device works as I initially intended and for that, THANK YOU ASUS! you really saved me from using two GPU's for four HDMI connections. The fact that I can use an external Thunder Bolt 3 enclosure to power and send data for the GPU is just amazing.. No regrets, highly recommend this GPU"

There are no buffering pauses, no jerkiness and the action is as smooth as any movie I have ever seen on any single-monitor computer. Folks, this is an amazing video card at a great price. For those who gave it one star, all I can say is they probably didn't realize that they needed to install the 64-bit drivers from the DVD that is included with the card. Without those drivers, Windows will default to a generic VGA driver, resulting in exactly the kind of slow, jerky video that the one-star reviewers complained about. Not only is this card displaying three full motion, full screen, full HD videos simultaneously, but the GPU isn't even breaking a sweat! The GPU Tweak utility that comes with the card shows that it is loafing along at well under the clock and temperature maximums, with plenty of capacity remaining for a 4th monitor if and when I decide to add one. By the way, I bought this card to use with my multi-monitor trading setup, and it is more than up to the job. Price charts and indicators on all three monitors are crisp and clear, updating instantaneously as new data comes in.

Avoid any Nvidia 1030 that says ""64 bit, GDDR4,"" or you'll waste your money, because even overclocked it doesn't even begin to match up with a standard Geforce 1030.

For shame, Nvidia. I expected better from you than to sell people a card with half the performance for the same price as a fully capable 1030. They might as well call these 715 cards, because when I ran the benchmarks, it clocked in at about 65% of the same benchmarks supplied by the standard 128 bit GDDR5 1030.

Now, MSI is a great company, but I wish they wouldn't sell these, and they will, as will others, as long as they believe these are actual 1030s."

The spec meets all my requirements and this is the best you can buy from nvidia with a passive cooler.

Installation is easy. Windows 10 downloads the driver automatically. linux requires a few command lines to fix it up.

But this video card is SLOW. If you use an app on one monitor and have a non full screen youtube playing on the second monitor, the video would stutter. Don't even try to fullscreen the youtube on the 2nd monitor, it might even lock up the browser.

MSI is a good company but NVidia shouldn't sell such a low performance product if it couldn't deliver what's claimed in the spec. Maybe it's a driver issue but the bottom line is that it's unusable for 4k in windows 10 and linux.

I ended up paying double the price for a 1060, although it is not fanless but at lease everything runs smoothly."

I've own few gt 1030 cards (evga, Asus, gigabyte) and this MSI GH version is a nightmare if you own SFF PC. The screw to swap out the low profile bracket is covered under the heatsink. You have to remove the screws for heatsink but by doing so, you will void the warranty. Luckily for me, I managed to use long small flathead and tilt it to remove that screw since it wasn't torque hard.
It's not a big deal if you own PC other than SFF, this card can handle 4k content with ease.
Pro:
-MSI advantage is that it has 1.4 dp and hdmi 2.0 port. Website show that it also supports up to 8k resolution, so it can do dual 4k monitor setup with those 2 ports. Other gt 1030 cards usually have hdmi-dvi combo ports.
I am currently running dual monitor on this card (27' 4k & 24' 1080p), and everything is smooth. 4k video is stable and gpu usage is only 30% max while watching 4K UHD content.
-Low power consumption (30w), I am using this on hp elite 8300 sff with only 240w power supply. So far everything works great, no random shutdown and it is running in good temperature

The MSI card specifically is the best (in my opinion) to own due to the robust (and still low profile) fan and the DP port over the DVI port in all other 1030 models. Don't let the small size fool you. The card achieves a Windows 7 (yes, I like 7) experience rating of 7.7 out of 7.9 and is capable of playing the latest games respectably even if you have to tone down some quality settings here and there. For what it is (small form factor, 30W power draw) it really packs a punch.

If at all possible you should get a GTX 1050 or higher card for much better value for your money, but for me this is the BEST (and only) option that will fit my small form factor, single slot only, low profile case.

I don't believe this card is worth it's price of $80+, but because of it's one-of-a-kind nature I guess it's reasonable for those of us with SFF PCs to have to pay a premium.

I put this card in a SFF Dell Optiplex 3020 for my mom because she's retired now and I'd like her to have the option of getting into gaming as a hobby. You know, keep her reflexes and mind stimulated instead of vegging on the couch all day.

I've already talked her into the Xbox game pass on PC (basically the Netflix of video games), and got her a Xbox controller, but we were both severely disappointed with the performance of the Dell's on board graphics.
This GT 1030 made a world of difference, I'm actually very impressed with the wide range of modern games this can play off the Windows 10 Xbox app.
I just had her playing Spiritfarer at 1080p max settings and it was running so so nice and smooth. (this is even with only a core i3 and 8GB of ram)

I'm a little anxious about her trying one of the more demanding games like Plague Tale. I saw her hovering over it checking out the description. I'm afraid one of these days I'll have to step in and give her the ""Your PC is not good enough"" talk and break her heart...
Then again, on lower graphics settings maybe even a game like Plague Tale could run just fine.

Overall I'm feeling good about the performance for most modern 2D and simple 3D games. The price bothers me, but It's the best option for the Dell 3020 and I think it will be worth it in the long run."

For 4k video, Nvidia has chosen not to support the monitor synchronization standard pioneered by ATI and used by most 4k monitors, so get occasional tears in fast moving 4k full resolution video. Card is fast enough that it works pretty well with new, inexpensive LG 4k monitor. Nvidia supports only Gsync -- possibly due to licensing or infringement.

I am very happy with a 40% increase in benchmarks with the Novabench test. I also checked performance using Resident Evil 6 system testing program (online download benchmark program) . Results were over 12,000--very favorable for such a budget computer. The stock configuration PC could barely make 2000 on this test. I tried a passive cooling card a year ago and it didn't fit= the heat sink hit on a white power plug before the card seated. So, I just waited for a better card- this one is it. Look carefully at the front lower left box corner, for the 2gb gddr5, LOW profile. OC label. Do not buy the gddr4 versions as they are much slower. As you can see in the picture, there is plenty of room for this card. MSI claims a 10 year life under normal usage. The OC version , means you can overclock the card with the MSI software.

IMPORTANT- I had black screen on boot up after installing the card- to fix it, I did this-
Turn off the computer and unplug.
Remove Graphic card.
Plug the monitor back to your regular system video output.
Turn on the computer.
Click on the windows button on the keybotd and type msconfig.
Select the Boot tab and click on the box that says Safe boot with minimal selected.
Apply then click apply, ok
Do a normal shut down and unplug.
Install Graphic card move the video cable back to the new card.
Restart- Go to device manager and verify a 1030 driver on display adapters- ( some systems you may have to also disable (do not delete) the onboard factory video driver to get the card to work)
Go back to the msconfig and uncheck the safe boot-
Restart your computer and everything should be working fine with the new video card.
I am very pleased with the much improved system performance- very snappy and multiple screens are not an issue anymore. If a septuagenarian can install this video card installation, almost anybody can."
11.0,MSI GT 1030 2GD4 LP OC Computer Graphics Cards,MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,1430 MHz,2 GB,$85.81,4.6 out of 5 stars,Good dedicated Graphics for Dell SFF Inspiron desktop 3470/3471 models.,"Finally arrived 1 Month late - still showing as lost/no delivery. It works with the Dell SFF 3470/3471 small desktops who have an PSU of 200 Watts. Mine has 200 W and this card will work with it. I use MSI Afterburner but only installed the drivers Windows downloads and the nVIDIA control panel on Microsoft Store. Should Dell guide you to the GT 730 only then just go with this GT 1030 since it works and doesnt overstress the PSU, as long you dont overclock this Graphics. I have the 9th gen i3-9100 quad core no hyperthreading but boost enabled processor in my new rig. That combined with total of 24 GB of RAM and this GT 1030 is an well matched system. On an test game (H&G) the Processor load hovers around 65%, the max RAM used is about 10.5 GB of RAM and the GT 1030 is loaded to about 99% on medium settings and at 1080p resolution which gave around 40 FPS (at 720p and low settings the GT 1030 is loaded to about 68% using 8 GB of system RAM, which gives around 60 FPS) . With MSI Afterburner I limited the max Temperature of the GT 1030 to 68 Celsius with 87% power and fan on auto (50% fan speed when 68 Celsius is reached at about 1300 MHz clock speed average - it clocks down at max temp) to maximize card longevity. At normal office work and entertainment like movie watching, etc the GT 1030 has an average temperature of around 41 degrees Celsius at 700 Mhz clock and fan at 35%. So be aware that this GT 1030 is by all means the bottle neck of this system and most likely any new processor with enough RAM will outperform this Graphic card. So low end new processors match well with this Card. The integrated UHD 630 of the processor had way more stutters and probably half as much FPS as the game was with this card way more playable, had better graphics and a very smooth picture scroll when turning around (FPS). With the integrated graphics (UHD 630) the total system RAM used was as high as 50% meaning around 12 GB.
So overall I just recommend this GT 1030 since it gives an way better experience and is a very good match to any low powered systems and low end new gen processors. With this particular game the GT 1030 was pegged at 99%, while the CPU hovered around up to max 75% and the RAM today needed for this system would be about at least 12 GB (I had 24 GB total RAM installed). All mayor components match each other very well with this system. The box states the transistors are ""military grade"" and have an aluminum core, while the card lasts 40 years normal office use at 60 Degrees Celsius (365000 hours) and 10 years for gaming when at 70 Degrees Celsius (112000 hours). While both fans, of the CPU and GT 1030 are on there is an noticeable humming sound when the graphics are not temp limited which could get annoying over time for students, etc (people used to total silence environment). While on entertaining (watching movies, Youtube, etc) the fans humming is not noticeable. The Dell SFF I have has only one single fan for the CPU and no desktop chassis fans whatsoever, additionally to the PSU fan. So the GT 1030's fan will provide a better air flow within the chassis as to help cool surrounding components as well as it moves air within the chassis. Thats a good thing although not totally silent. On 99% load, 68 Celsius temp limit, the GT 1030 fan is not noticeable louder as at normal 35% speed - again, no overclocking. To overclock (which I am not a friend of since it shortens the GT 1030's life span) the PSU must be at least 300 Watts. So in my case with an 200 Watt PSU I would never risk to overclock this GPU. It works and is an good GPU for medium games, Foto rendering and video editing. At least an 100% improvement over the UHD 630 integrated Graphics the i3-9100 came with. However the GT 1030 is not noticeable lowering the work load of the processor since it has similar loads with integrated or this dedicated card - indicating the GT 1030 is not helping the CPU processing its chores. I recommend this GT 1030 since its for sure an improvement over any integrated Intel graphics (dunno about the Ryzen integrated Vega 11 of ATI, since that should be similar to the GT 1030). Get the GDDR5 instead of the GDDR4. On my system the Memory speed of the GT 1030 clocks at 3000 Mhz while the card states its capable of 6000 Mhz - PCIe states 4 lanes used (or something) which maybe the cause of that."

It is only one GT 1030, with 2GB DDR5. It is fanless. It does come with a low profile bracket. Here's the problem: to install the low profile bracket, you must remove the two screws that secure the regular size bracket. But one of those screws is blocked by the giant heatsink, so you must also remove the four screws that secure the heatsink, and remove the heatsink. One of these screws has a little ""void warranty"" sticker over the screw head--so it seems that you void the warranty if you want to install the low profile bracket (?). In addition, when you remove the heatsink you expose the thermal grease covering the GPU and the 2 thermal pads covering the memory chips. If you've built PCs you know that before you put the heatsink back in place you're supposed to clean off the old grease and remove the old thermal pads, then put new grease on and install new thermal pads. I did not replace the grease or put on new thermal pads; so far the heat is okay when I run the card. I don't game; the biggest stress I put on it so far was running a 5 minute 2K60fps video clip on my 2k monitor. The warmest the GPU got was 49 degrees Celsius. If I run into temperature or throttling problems later, I will update this review.

By the way--Windows 10 Pro 64-bit automatically installed drivers for this card, though it took 4 or 5 minutes. It fit into my HP Elitedesk G2 SFF and so far has drawn a maximum of 13 watts (but I don't game). Also, I don't know how the card handles overclocking since I don't plan to do that."

- single slot
- 144hz monitor only takes DP so it must have DP
- low TDP for use with a 300 watt psu
everything else is icing on the cake. it took me a lot of research to find the right card that meets all these criteria. the GT 710s i've seen don't have displayport. the 1050 although low profile is available takes up 2 slots minimum. GT 1030s by other manufacturers besides MSI have HDMI and not displayport. so I must thank MSI for making this particular build. also nVidia added G-sync support to the humble 1030 a while ago, so I am extremely happy about that!
i paired my GT 1030 with an A10-7860K overclocked to 4.2 ghz, 8 GB DDR3. it runs GTA V spectacularly at 45-55 FPS at 1080p with settings optimized by geforce experience. if this setup can run GTA V and give me that kind of performance it can run 95% of everything out there. csgo runs very smoothly and borderlands GOTY is also butter smooth.

So .. worked for me! I can't rate its gaming performance since I don't use it for gaming (and I don't use it for Second LIfe all that much, basically I just tested it) but for web browsing and productivity, the card just rocks!"
11.0,MSI GT 1030 2GD4 LP OC Computer Graphics Cards,MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,1430 MHz,2 GB,$85.81,4.6 out of 5 stars,Great GPU for Gamers on a tight budget.,"I bought this back in September. Delivered the first week of October. I waited a while to review so I can test it out and see how it was. Now I waited until my return window closed.

This GPU is a great entry level for gaming. It’s cheap and works really well. At medium settings I can get 60+ FPS at 720-1080p (depending on game)

I previously had an MSI R7 240 2GDDR3

This makes that GPU look like a dinosaur in comparison. It is way faster. The default clock speeds are WAY higher. And this has GDDR5 which is faster than GDDR3

I am using it in a Dell Optiplex 790 DT (it’s the mode right above SFF, so it’s still a small form factor case. But the PSU has more wattage and the case is a bit bigger)

Even though the PSU has low wattage, this GPU works great. Because it gets its power directly from the motherboards PCI slot itself. No external power needed. Just plug and play..

Windows 10 auto installed drivers but I proceeded to install NVidia Experience. Etc...

Also Nvidias replay doesn’t work on this GPU so if you want to replay I recommend using an app called “Medal TV” it has the same functions has Nvidia replay and works perfectly.

I would definitely recommend this if you’re on a budget.. but if you do have a higher budget get the 1650 Low Profile"
11.0,MSI GT 1030 2GD4 LP OC Computer Graphics Cards,MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,1430 MHz,2 GB,$85.81,4.6 out of 5 stars,Excellent Features and Performance,"Needed a graphics card for my dad’s htpc computer build (home theater PC). The Ryzen 5 1600 needed a dedicated GPU and this was the perfect GPU. It is completely silent (since it has no fans), and has a HDMI and DVI 1.2 port. Making it perfect if upgrading to a 4k monitor later in the future (just regular computer work). Since this wasn't bought for gaming, I can't say anything about its performance there. But, while doing regular computer work, I've had no issues with it. Hope this review was helpful!"
11.0,MSI GT 1030 2GD4 LP OC Computer Graphics Cards,MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,1430 MHz,2 GB,$85.81,4.6 out of 5 stars,"excellent card, tricky to replace the bracket","I think it is an excellent card. I only give it 4 stars because replacing the bracket is much more tricky than what one may expect.

pros:
* works perfectly (ubuntu 16.04, nvidia 384 driver in an hp 8300 sff).
* DP and HDMI connectors. No DVI, no RGB (I was not interested in either).
* low power, quiet. Power draw ranges between ~10W and 22W when idling/under full load according to nvidia-smi.
* excellent for 4k @ 60Hz display for everyday tasks and photo editing. (DP, haven't tested HDMI). On-board HD4000 was able to display 4k, but only 30Hz and occasionally crashing.
* you can even play simple games, such as even Minecraft on 4k display (although your mileage with shaders will vary).

cons:
* the only problem I see is the bracket screw underneath the heatsink which makes it tricky to switch to the low-profile bracket. PLEASE re-design the layout! Even such a simple solution as drilling a hole into the heatsink would solve the issue. I managed to replace it without removing the sink but pushed and bent the board more than what I felt safe. If you have a full-size box, this is not an issue.

Obviously, this card cannot compete with a 1080. If you do modern gaming, get something more powerful."

I have a UHD (4k) TV and a FHD (1920x1080) monitor on the side. It runs about 40 deg C when idle and only about 57 deg C when busy. I have a large desktop PC case with only one fan in the case and one in the power supply.

I'm using it with Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and MythTV. 1920x1080 @ 60Hz looks great and the CPU load running MythTV with the ""VDPAU Advanced"" setting is almost nothing. A big improvement over the 9400 GT it replaced, and it only uses 40% of the power and there's no fan.

Netflix or YouTube at 1080 @ 60Hz work great - the CPU gets a little busy, but it handles it.

YouTube at 2160 @ 30Hz bogs and stutters. This card does not have VP9 codec support (used for YouTube 1440 & 2160 videos). I installed the Chrome extension H264ify so that YouTube will use H.264 codec for 1440 & 2160 videos and then they play smoothly, but the CPU is near max.

This card also does NOT support HEVC / H.265 which is used by Netflix for 4k video, and It cannot do 4k/60Hz. If you want good 4k/60Hz performance you need a GTX 950, which also supports HEVC for Netflix 4k."

I did that purposely so I could add my own preference of upgrades. I do have a work computer dedicated to high-end video, photo and graphics editing and another dedicated to gaming, but I wanted to be able to do both from time-to-time on my home PC where I usually work of projects.

That being said, no one including me will ever say this card is a high-end gaming/graphics card. It isn’t. But don’t believe that anything low-end is without merit, or as I saw one claim that the onboard video that comes with a basic computer is better than any low-end graphics card. Logic says that shared memory vs. dedicated memory and a card optimized for graphics can be a useful and valuable upgrade. Note that the company classifies this as a Corporate Stable Model. What does that mean? I asked and the answer was simply that products with that designation are designed for business to be compatible with a wide range of operating systems and hardware and to have enhanced product support not usually available with consumer-grade products. Maybe the most intriguing is what they call advance-swap – if you’re having trouble with your card they let you keep it in service until they send you a replacement, so you’re not left with a non-working computer for days or weeks. Owning a business I know that can mean running task-intensive software, the need for stable graphic performance, and the expectation that the components in a business computer likely will be powered on and often in use 24/7.

But which one to choose? There are so many brands with so many specs that sound similar but fall down when it comes to the quality of the components, which can result in intermittent performance, not actually achieving expected performance or early failure. So for me the place to start is with the ASUS brand name. The people who really know about graphics cards rarely disagree about the fact that this company is fanatical about quality.

After that decision I found that reading what others have to say doesn’t mean much, there are so many variables when it comes to every other component in their computer system, what apps they are using, how bogged down with apps their computer is, the list goes on … this is one product that I believe the only way to know if it is going to work for you is to get it and try it in your systems for your unique purposes.

So the first hint I think can be useful if you are in a daze and simply don’t know which one to choose is to look at the fine print above. Every item here has a date of first sale (you can actually do a sort by several parameters and one of them is to list the most recently added products in any category). You’ll find that some of the video graphics cards still being sold here can go back as far as Windows XP or even earlier. Not coincidentally, it seems the number one reason people say they aren’t satisfied with a graphics card is that it isn’t compatible with newer operating systems like WIN10. By buying a card like this that was designed and manufactured after WIN10 was introduced and has drivers included written for WIN10 you’ve upped your chances of 100% compatibility a lot and took a big step toward future compatibility as well.

So, after several weeks of research and saving at least a dozen semi-finalists to my cart, this is the one I chose. And I think I did good, it works extremely well, it’s such a breath of fresh air for something to just work like it’s supposed to.

Two final words of caution: I don’t have any problems with the most popular search engine that starts with G---, it’s always been my preferred search engine. But if you don’t want their chrome or their search bar option please note that both are set to install by default unless you catch it and opt out. You have to uncheck them if you don’t want them. The other heads-up is just my duh mistake – the card ships with a plastic protective piece over the contacts. I didn’t see it and tried to insert it into the motherboard. Hmm, it wouldn’t go into the slot. Hey, don’t laugh at me, at least I caught it before trying to force it in."

CSM means something totally different to ASUS, apparently. I thought it meant compatibility with older systems that don't use UEFI as their boot firmware. Apparently not. I plugged it in and there was no video output from the card. I installed all the drivers from the CD, website, etc under Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. Still nothing. Heat sinks got warm so I knew it was drawing power, and I have a 300w PSU (the minimum for the card according to the box). It said absolutely nothing about requiring UEFI. Now I'm stuck buying a different card for this PC.

I guess I'm lucky that my other desktop was compatible with this card, so it's not a total waste. But it did not work in the system it was intended for, which I found quite frustrating and disappointing. This is the first and last ASUS product I'll be buying, due to misleading advertising. Everything else was as advertised and quality is fine. But when the card won't display video output at all it's a bit of a show-stopper."

One of the components I chose for this build was the GT710 graphics card. I have a separate machine for work and gaming, so I really didn't need anything overkill, nor did I wanna break the bank on this thing. Upon doing some research, this seemed a like a great budget graphics card for someone that wants to run a large monitor and/or dual monitors on a budget. The benchmarks out there for the GT710 are great, and I think it's awesome that it also has 2GB of memory.

I originally purchased an MSI Geforce 710. I was quick to return it due to it having a very noisy fan (I specifically chose parts to build a very quite computer for music, but the graphics card is one thing I overlooked). Upon researching, I came across this model on Amazon, which features a larger heatsink and no fan. I ordered it. This thing works great!

This is an absolutely awesome graphics card if you want a nice and quiet computer, especially if you're making this for a home entertainment center or for music production like me. I simply have nothing bad to say about it. I'm just a huge fan of the fanless design. It's very low profile (pictured), plenty of space to install this in a Micro ATX build (I did remove one of the DVI screws to fit it in easier but this isn't a big hassle and is to be expected in tight cases like mine). Just a simple, small, and robust graphics card.

It does everything I need it to do, runs my desktop on 1080p, runs all my music programs great, I can watch movies and YouTube videos on here with ease. Despite being fanless, it has never overheated on me once. Just a great ""productivity class"" graphics card, I'd recommend it for office and light-duty graphical work. If you're eyeing this up for gaming, don't expect it to play games well. I'm sure this thing can do some low-level gaming, paired with a good CPU (I'm running and i3 9100f with this build). But don't expect it to run Battlefield or Metro. I do intend on testing a game on here soon just so see how well it holds up, and will post results on this. For games like Starcraft II, WoW, I think this thing may hold up pretty decently. But I'd recommend spending a little more in that category."

The new card is a ASUS GT710 2 gig, I put the card in and it locked the machine up. I tried many thing but it stops at starting windows and will sit forever..

I called Amazon they tried to help then connected me to ASUS they didn't have a clue and told me they do not have any techs available and they would call me back , they never did.

This is Junk , the card that came out is a Geforce 620 no problems . it even works if i put it back but this card does not work and there is no way to get it to work . Amazon shame on you for even selling this junk.

I am stuck with it now because I did not get a chance to install until yesterday if it says 30 days return policy not as
good idea to purchase it unless you install it the day it comes in. You would think Amazon would take into
consideration people go away during the summer if it had come in one day sooner I would of had time to find out it was junk. maybe it will work in one of my other computers , I would say it just isn't worth it........

I am updating this review if i could give this a new rating number it would be (NEGITIVE 5) stars.t has been about a week now and this junk is still junk.
I spent too many hours trying to get this running turns out this card ""DOES NOT WORK"" on HP computers. after researching everything it is a known bios problem with the 700 series cards and HP motherboards.

Thank you Amazon , you take money out of our pockets and fill our landfill with all the junk that does not work.
I think sometime it may be better to purchase local, at least you get it that day and have somewhere to return it when it doesn't work , and you almost never get returned stuff, or used junk that doesn't' work.

I am updating a second time , I did get the card to work , it took lots of work , no help from ASUS or amazon.

So purchase at your own risk.....if your other card is dead and you can not get back into the screens DO NOT PURCHASE this card it requires you to set up after the machine is booted, if you have no screen or the computer doesn't recognize the new card , you are out of luck."

You can only use a dedicated GPU for a second monitor in that system setup because the Integrated Graphics in the CPU will not allow you to run the main display off of the dedicated GPU. You will also need to modify several UEFI Bios settings and install the drivers from the manufacturer's website for the card to even be recognized in Windows 10 with the latest Creators' Update. I was able to make windows use the dedicated card as the main display, using a second monitor plugged into it, once I was booted up and logged in, but once you shut down and try to boot into windows again, you will be greeted with a nice black screen as the IGFX in the CPU takes over and hijacks the output signal again. The only option I have not tried is to disable the Vega11 dedicated driver while the settings in windows 10 are set to use the dedicated GPU as the main display. My theory, and my fear, is that it will still fail to recognize the dedicated card after a reboot, thus leaving me with no screen and no way to get back into windows to fix it because the dedicated graphics are disabled in device manager. I have ordered an external hard drive so I can create a complete disk image backup before I try it. Just know that you are going to have a fight on your hands if you try to use this card with this particular IGFX and an ASUS A320 MOBO using the Ryzen5 2400G Processor. Because of this hassle, I took the ratings down a notch, but you really can't blame the card for this problem, as all of the fault lies mainly with the fact that this processor and motherboard, along with the poor UEFI Bios settings options, are the real problem here. Also, if you are wondering why someone would put a card of this caliber into a computer with a dedicated GPU like the Ryzen5, it's because the Ryzen5 Vega 11 isn't all it's cracked up to be. My old windows XP computer that is 10 years old will play movies and games better than this chip. Maybe it's because it uses system memory and has to fight with all of the other system processes unlike dedicated cards with their own memory and processor capabilities. Anyhow, I hate the Ryzen5 and wish I could throw the computer it the trash and just shell out for a better one with an Intel chip and MOBO that will take a decent graphics card that will actually do the job right."

I went with a Dell 27 incher because Dell is a trusted quality brand and I got a great deal on Amazon. But now I needed a new graphics card because the stock one had no vga or hdmi connection.

After researching a bit I decided the GeForce GT 710 was likely to be compatible with no issues - plug and play on the Mac, with no need to install drivers or fuss around. With 2 gigs of ram it was also an upgrade from the original 512 card. I don't play games, just watch videos and do a lot of work in Photoshop, so 2GB is plenty for my needs.

The card was a cinch to install. The Macpro is brilliantly designed to be upgrade friendly. Switching out the old card and installing the new one took just a few minutes. I tested it with vga first, then switched to HDMI. Based on that quickie test I'd recommend using HDMI.

I opened some Photoshop work I had done before the old monitor died - and saw subtle details revealed by the upgraded graphic card that weren't apparent before. I'm sure the difference is due to the card, not the new monitor.

I tested some videos and again was impressed with both the color, which seemed more naturalistic, and the details. Very pleased with this card."

The on-board Radeon 4200 video was very sluggish and bogged down my AMD Quad Core in Win10 with 5 gB RAM. In fact, it would not (no matter what driver), fill the full screen of a 27"" monitor at 1080p.

This is not a gaming application, but more for flat graphics (like an SDR Waterfall Display of radio signals). After installing this card and the accompanying driver, my processor load dropped from 30% to 18%, the video was much sharper (text/fonts more easily read), and the sluggishness I had been experiencing with the motherboard video disappeared. For some reason, the contrast on the display is also much better, making text easier to read.

The big plus was I did not have to upgrade my power supply in the tower. The fact that it does not use a fan, but rather a large heat sink was also nice.

For my purposes, this was a good investment, and a perfect fit to my applications. It was $30 or so when I bought it, I see it has gone up, since then.

Overall, could not be more pleased, not because it is the greatest graphic card in the world, but it outperforms the motherboard graphics by a lot, works with existing power supply and didn't cost a fortune."

You probably have found that you cannot physically fit most graphics cards in your low profile computer, and this one will totally fit with the included adapter and a minute of changing out the brackets.

This card will not get you playing all the hottest 3D games though. This card will get you playing stuff thats 4-5 years old with MAYBE medium graphics settings. It will make it so you can play most 2D games comfortably, even newer ones, and your youtube videos can now be full screen without tearing and lag.

The 210 GPU device is significantly SLOWER than my on-board graphics -- the one that's built into the CPU. You can see for yourself by running the Windows Experience Index. It'sbuilt into XP, Win7, and Windows10 (see below). Please know that I am NOT a gamer, and so am not approaching this from any ""Need for Speed"" -- only a guy who wanted to get an HDMI connection for his monitor. Don't waste your money!

If your computer is pretty old and has only VGA output to your monitor or TV, this might possibly suit your needs.for hookup. But it won't be much of an improvement -- if any -- and it costs more than simple alternatives Consider these options instead: Your VGA output, with an inexpensive adapter to HDMI will work fine, though you will need to run audio through a separate cable. For Display Port (DP) connection, just get an adapter to HDMI. It will have audio connection built in. The same is true for DVI -- just get an adapter. Many are less than $10.00.

Now, about the simple test. Wikipedia has an excellent article on the Windows Experience Index, and spells out the different test ranges for XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, and even Windows 8. The scale (or range) for each operating system is slightly different, and Windows 8 is kind of unwieldy. But just run the test from the Control Panel -- System and Security. Write down your present values (there are five) before installing this card. Get it running and then run the test again. It's Slower! All you did was spend extra money!

By the way, ASUS support is pretty much a joke. After you get through deciphering the telephone tree (which likely will take several tries) you get someone who will issue you a ""Case number"". You don't get any actual help, as these folks just assemble the card (in China). If you try to get help from nVidia or GeForce, their website allows you to update the drivers for your card. If you're patient, their website does tell you all about the things this card WON'T do. Still, you don't get any actual help for this card being slower than what you already had. You might end up by simply returning the card. I did."

This card was the last piece of the system - I needed something that could output secure HDMI so that I could replay copy protected content, and I wanted something with no fan (so that it was quieter) and that used as little electricity as possible, especially while idle.

The card is everything I could want - it was compatible, easy to install, it's low power and silent, and it is working great with my PC and TV.

A couple tips:

1) This unit is fanless - it just has that giant finned heat sink attached to it. It might not fit in thin PCs, and it would be tough to put a card next to it. On the other hand, I love that it has no fan - there are no moving parts to go wrong, and I want my media center PC to be quiet.

2) It's an old card, so I'm sure it wouldn't run most modern games. But again, that's a plus for my purposes - it uses less electricity and produces less heat than a more powerful card.

3) It was able to rum my HDMI TV and my old VGA monitor simultaneously, which was cool, but WMC wouldn't play protected content while I had the unsecure monitor plugged in, so now I'm using the TV as a monitor.

4) I did some googling on similar cards. From what I can tell, the 210 is a little better than the  GeForce 8400GS , so I picked the 210 over that. It looks like the  Radeon 5450  and 6450 *might* be a little better, but those were pricier and harder to get, so I ultimately chose the 210. So far, no complaints!"

This was a breeze to install. I just swapped out the bracket for the low profile one that came with the card and it went in easily (with the large cooling fins you do need extra room, my computer had 2 slots so I put it in the side that allowed the fins to stick out over the other slot). I had already downloaded the newest drivers from the NVIDIA website so it was a breeze to get it up and running. This wouldn't be ideal for video games, but since I am just using it for streaming video, it is a very effective and inexpensive solution. Update, I also purchased a refurbished small HP and another of these video cards. It works great for streaming on that computer as well. Perfect silent card which worked great with the included low profile brackets for both computers."
12.0,Asus GeForce GT 710 2GB GDDR5 HDMI VGA DVI Graphics Card Graphic Cards GT710-SL-2GD5-CSM,ASUS Computer International Direct,NVIDIA,954 MHz,2 GB,$54.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"No sound, low heat, good for HD video, lousy for games.","When it became clear that my HTPC was going to have problems due to the on-board graphics being a legacy chipset that was barely supported and would not output in 16:9 aspect ratio over HDMI, I searched for an inexpensive solution to that problem. The ASUS GeForce 210 was that answer. It has no fan, so it's completely silent (something I value in an HTPC). It has enough power to handle 1080p video and output 5.1 DTS without any hiccups (depending on your CPU, as well, I'd imagine). It's easy to install, supports half-height bays if you have a slim HTPC, and doesn't require any extra power connections.

The drivers provided are a bit old, so you'll want to ignore the CD that comes with this and download the latest GeForce drivers for this device. Understand also that this won't work with Nvidia's game optimizing software. In truth, you wouldn't want this for gaming. It can handle some recent games on lowest settings (and still lags) but this is not really a gamers' video card.

However, for an HTPC or standard office PC that just needs a replacement for on-board video, this is a step up from some of the legacy onboard chipsets you'll find out there. It does a great job with Kodi, Netflix, Hulu Plus, VLC, and YouTube. I've played 1080p H.264 and HEVC with no issues, and it gets along with my Yamaha receiver and Epson projector, too, which is important in an HTPC graphics card.

Bottom line: It does what I expected it to do. It works great for an HTPC and the price was fantastic. If you just need a basic card for HD video, this would be a good choice."

But after the return period lapsed (of course), it began random black outs lasting from a few seconds to 10 seconds. The mouse cursor still worked against the black screen.
However, it just went black and stayed that way after a weird momentary color waterfall display. Alt-Ctl-Del did not work, so I could not shut down. I had use the power button.
When I restarted, the card was fine. I searched the NVIDIA website, but could not find an updated driver. Nor did Windows Update have a newer one.
I bought 2 cards and installed one in my PC and one in my wife's. She reports random black screens as well. My motherboard is an Asus, hers is a Gigabyte. I hope no one else experiences this, but wanted to alert the community if the potential.
Thanks."

It functioned properly. It shows videos fine.
It can play games where there is no requirement to display 3d from different perspectives.
It can't deal with the requirements to render 3d display from a changeable perspective.
For example, Skyrim is a 9 year-old game, but even on the lowest video display settings this card can not cope with the demand.

I don't know if this card is any better than on-board video in the systems sold over the last few years. I suppose if the on-board video in your computer breaks, this card might be useful as a replacement."

As for its use as display card: Is seems adequate to drive my two dell 24 inch monitors. I can not detect any other particular improvements. The tiny dongles it requires are a also a pain in the most southern region.

Update September 2018:
No problems and I occasionally use it to drive a 42 Inch Visio TV TV as well as the two Dell computer monitor.
I note someone commented about the quality of the video encoding. That is controlled by the encoding parameters. You can anything from low quality and high speed to high quality and low speed. I tried for something in the middle.

These are the cables that I am using. I needed a 10 foot and a six foot cable. These work and are relative thin. I tried some others that did NOT work.

The UBUNTU drivers for the board don't work properly, so you have to use the Nvidia drivers. Nvidia's install script leaves a lot to be desired. It works, but isn't obvious. It also doesn't update the /etc/default/grub file so if you happen to change it, the driver disappears and you're left at 640x480. Reinstalling the driver solves the issue, but Nvidia should update the system files so that changing Grub doesn't clobber their driver."
13.0,PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,Nvidia,1 GHz,1 GB,$229.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,Works with Ubuntu 20.04 and Nvida Driver 440.64,"I bought this (VCQP400-PB) card to replace an AMD V7900 that died. I'm using it in Dell T5500 workstation with 3 monitors, two in landscape and one in portrait mode. All three monitors are attached using DisplayPort cables. The card is small, so I had to use the included taller bracket to install. The card is short in length and in height.

The card is low power and doesn't require the use of an extra 6/8 pin power cable.

The card does support 3 monitors simultaneously. Also, the card came with three miniDP to DP adapters, even though they're not shown in the V1 pictures. As I write this only the pictures for the V2 version show the adapters. I would preferred not to have to use adapters, but I would have to buy a much more expensive card to get standard DisplayPort connectors. The mini connectors do lock into the back, so except for reliability problems associated with more connections, I expect these will work OK.

The only problem I had with installation was getting the portrait monitor to work. The Ubuntu display settings tool just wouldn't work with the portrait monitor. It either turned the monitor off or left it in landscape mode. I solved the problem by using the Nvidia X Server Settings tool.

I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak to performance there, but playback in Kdenlive (a non-linear video editor) was smoother than with the AMD card. HTML5 rendering in browsers also seems a bit faster.

Amazon was the vendor. No problems with the shipping or packaging."

My only issue was that the video card fan was dying so it was either build a new pc or replace the video card and squeeze out a bit more from this relic. Of course with the GPU market being overpriced due to data mining it took me a while to figure out how much performance I was willing to pay for at this time, with maybe an eye towards this being used in a new pc build over the next year. Fortunately the extra research this required allowed me to stumble upon an issue I didn’t know I had. That issue is that a few years ago PC BIOS was replaced by UEFI and the latest video cards won’t even boot on what is referred to as ‘legacy’ bios. After some research I found that this 1030 card is one of the most recent cards which will boot with legacy bios and is why I selected it. It was also only around 70 bucks which made this an easy choice. It installed easily, I pulled down drivers from Nvidia, and all is well. This card was theoretically 50% faster than the card it was replacing but when I ran new benchmarks it only reflected a few percentage points in some tests and better in others. There are other bottlenecks on this old system so I’m not surprised but since I can’t install anything newer than this model, and my old card was dying, I’m still happy with this purchase."

Also runs Fortnite at medium-high settings in 1920x1080 at around 50-60fps. Can run pretty much any non AAA title, as well as most AAA titles released before 2015/16 at decent settings (depending on your CPU and RAM, of course). It is very easy to install, just pop it into your PCI-e 16 slot on your motherboard, as it only requires 30W of power. It can fit into most medium to large sized cases (the actual dimensions of the card are 4.38in x 6.6in x 1.1in for WxLxH, not what it says on the Amazon page). It is also very quiet, even when it is running games. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade your system without spending over $100 and still getting solid performance for its price point, I highly recommend it."

(non-gaming)","I received my GT 1030 OC from Amazon Warehouse Deals (AWD) today and promptly installed it in my 11 year old HP Pavilion Elite M9200t [Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q9450 @ 2.66 GHz 2.67 Ghz, 8GB RAM, Win10 64 bit, PCIe 2.0}...piece of cake, and backward compatible with PCIe 2.0.

As other reviewers suggested, I didn't bother with the enclosed CD-I went to the Gigabyte website to install the latest drivers & the Aorus Engine, mainly to monitor the temperature due to past video card overheating experience (no gaming).

I'm replacing a seven year old EVGA GT 520 card that's been recently having a problem with the fan- it stops turning at inappropriate times and overheats (I used canned air & a vacuum a few times in the last two months to get out any dust particles that might be unseen, which helps for awhile ).

Last week, I tried an open-box Gigabyte GT 1030 silent low-profile (from AWD), but within minutes, it seemed to be running quite hot, despite multiple fans in my PC, so much so that it did sudden re-boots of my PC several times. It also had such a tall heatsink that it was smashing the firewire plug on my motherboard. Not sure if that had anything to do with the hot temp & multiple re-boots. I had to send it back. My power supply is a 385W that isn't maxed out so it's not that.

This GT 1030 SC isn't as tall as the fan-less GT 1030, so it's well below the firewire plug and has been running fine without any re-booting issues. The temp has stayed around 37°(C) with standard PC use (no gaming, just watching videos, web surfing, MS Office, etc).

So far, this card seems like the perfect replacement for an old PC like mine or newer machine.

NOT reflected in my review rating is that I went with AWD to save a few dollars over a new item. I'm not opposed to an open-box product if it works as it should. I'll admit, I was initially concerned about the condition of the card when I saw the box's condition, but the card seems to function fine. AWD's description of the item was accurate. Everything is running great! :o)

UPDATE April 25, 2019: Three months later, this card is still working great on my 11 year old HP Pavilion Elite M9200t (no ""gaming"", just Microsoft Office 2016, graphics/photo editing, some video editing, Internet, machine embroidery digitizing & designing, etc.)"

I had less than $100 to put into a PC that I had invested $127 into in hopes of reaching an FPS average that would allow me to play online racing and flying simulators without the latency that would hinder my ability to be competitive or cause grief to those playing on the same server due to my inconsistency in the game's sync. I bought an older Dell Optiplex 790 retired workstation PC from the FB marketplace for $100 that came with an Intel I7 CPU, 8GB RAM, DVD-RW, front multi card reader, 1GB GPU, and 300w PwrSply, but no wi-fi card, input devices, display or cords. I had a small junk pile of old keyboards, mice, cables, etc due to being very low income because of decisions made 25yrs earlier. Anyways, I get a lot of use from repairing broken things as well as giving new life to older items in which people have lost interest or have upgraded from. I found this and pulled the trigger with the order. While waiting on its arrival I installed 4GB of RAM for $23 to give me 12GB RAM. I also downloaded iRacing, War Thunder, Project Cars 2, and a lower level MS store flight sim in anticipation. With the original 1GB GPU, iRacing would run at 70FPS at the lowest settings which isn't suitable for dirt racing as dynamic HDR graphics are required to compete at any level. War Thunder wouldn't run at all on minimum settings without consistent tearing and lockups. Project Cars 2 would run barely on min while the low min req need flight sim would run but was full of lag with settings higher than midrange. After I installed and properly set up the drivers and config of the GeForce GT 1030 2GB I decided I had no idea what I was doing when reading stats. This GPU runs all the above games on at least medium settings without any lag or graphic degradation during play. I can run iRacing on their recommended cap of 84FPS with most graphical ""extras"" and aids on high while running car and track textures on ultra-high. I also use med resolution shadows, reflections, dynamic tire and track, and pit crews. I am amazed that I have a PC that I have less than $250USD invested yet it performs as well, if not better than most $500-$1100 ""gaming PCs"" sold in department stores. I have used this PC with GeForce 1030 2GB GPU for a while now without unwanted issues. I am so pleased I have built a custom sim racing cockpit, FFB competition-level racing wheel and pedals, flight stick(HOTAS), soundbar w subwoofer, BlueTooth and WiFi dongles, and a wireless mouse. I now have a decent gaming setup that I use for sim car, truck, FPV drone racing/flying as well as shooter games, streaming, mild video editing, web surfing, watching movies and bragging to those that spent 5X more for the same level of usefulness. my recommendations? Buy the damn card if you have a decent CPU, power supply, and amount of RAM if you want a mid-level gaming machine that doesn't cost more than it realistically should.

Watching and streaming video in any resolution goes from being super smooth to choppy for a few seconds and then back again. This is especially apparent when watching 4k and HDR content. Many times playback will speed up to ""catch up"" after it's choppy phase.

Instead I mostly play older titles and indie stuff that isn't super demanding. I recently got a refurbished PC for cheap and the onboard graphics card was so bad that it couldn't run games that the five-year-old budget computer it was replacing COULD run. Forced to upgrade it, I decided on this card, as at the time it appeared to be the best ratio of price to quality. The ultra-powerful cards were out of my budget, and the ones cheaper than this seemed like they wouldn't be enough of an upgrade to bother.

Getting the thing installed took a while, but I did eventually manage it on my own, and it was my first time ever installing a graphics card. I also got myself an upgraded power supply while I was at it and installed that, too, just to be sure my PC could handle the new card. Once it was installed, getting all the drivers and such on board took even longer, but eventually I was good to go. The result was everything I could have hoped for - my PC now plays every game I throw at it without issue, and it even runs more quietly than before.

I don't know what people are talking about, this is not a noisy card. To start, I think you need to know what i'm dealing with:

HAF912 case with 2x200mm fans (front&top), 1x120mm fan venting out back. the 140mm fan on my evo cpu cooler makes more noise at rest. (2600x, 16GB 3000CL15, Gigabyte Aorus MB, 750W)

I mention this because, unlike most ""beauty/display"" cases with glass sides, mine is full of holes...literally. Lots of air is flowing in and out; 200mm fans push so much air at lower frequency that my case temps never exceed 35'C. As you can imagine, the latent/standing air is relatively cool compared to gpu&cpu temps and heat exchangers have access to cooler air.
During demanding gaming sessions, the Pulse will ramp up and hit ~72'C and the fans will kick in and sustain at 80%, but fan noise is less my old GPU (my GTX980 caps at 84'C all the time and with smaller fans going at 100%=more high pitched whine). Not that any of that matters since most gamers have headsets and can't hear their computer.
Honestly, I can still hear enemy footsteps on my mediocre (but very good value) mpow eg8 headset. Granted my computer is on the floor so sound has to travel a bit and bounce off some surfaces before it hits me in the head.
I'd add a photo (cuz the red 'sapphire' looks good with my red led fans, cpu cooler and mb) but for some reason, amazon isn't accepting any of my photo formats.
Games i play: overwatch, destiny2, gears of war5, apex (1440p, med/high, 144hz)

ps. if you are having issues: update your mb bios, radeon driver, windows 10

UPDATE: 4weeks later. I did have an issue. I was playing overwatch and it crashed...hundreds of hours playing on my 980 and I've never had a game crash. Anyway, updated AMD drivers and after >40hrs of play, it looks solid. Updates are great; very subjective observation, but images look sharper. Will update again in 2020.

UPDATE: This update is earlier than i said but i had to share my experience as i just upgraded to 27"" 1440p 144hz Acer monitor. Just awesome, overwatch just became a lot easier. Those snipers wayyyyy out there...i can see them now! Wow. If i had known what a difference more pixels would make,i would have updated earlier! The Pulse is keeping up just fine, no lag, no tearing, no issues but i do play on medium settings, 144hz, 1440p. Now,when i watch movies that are 720 or 1080, sometimes i can see lines in static scenes (is it my new monitor or gpu...i dont know), anything with motion is awesome. I also tried watching 4k videos at 144hz and those didnt look too hot either. Gaming good, im soo happy!

UPDATE: 12.19.19: well, things are going south fast. my love affair with all things AMD is now over...with the recent update to 19.12.2, i'm getting monitor failure during routine use (web browsing/Netflix). when I swap out my sapphire pulse rx5700xt for my old and trusty gtx980, no problem. but the recent update is causing a ton of ""no signal detected"" issues from GPU. failure with hdmi and dp cables that work fine on gtx980. thought it might have been monitor (Acer 27"" gaming monitor (ED273UR)), but swapped that out for my old msi 27"" and same signal failure :( sooooo, now I've dropped the rating from 5 stars to 1. I'm starting communications with Sapphire Tech; obviously this failure happened outside the return window.

UPDATE: 12.20.19: updated to radeon driver 19.12.3 finally, all that ""no signal detected"" messiness and black screen stuff is gone. I was 'this close' to buying an RTX2070S...and to be honest, if I had known I was going to encounter these kind of crashes every time AMD tries to optimize the GPU drivers for 'this game' or 'that game', i'd have stayed with Nvidia (even though I really, really, really hate their pricing model). Another thing i've noticed is that the RX5700XT isn't tracking with the RTX2070S...it used to when it was first released and everyone who had one was dropping it into a hot gaming rig, but with the advent of 3rd party/custom GPU's, test data from Userbenchmark and Passmark have the RX57000XT more on par with the 2060S/2070. Either that or the driver updates for the 2070S are doing much better for that product line. I've cautiously upgraded to 3-stars, and my advice is: if you are on a budget for a GPU that can handle your gaming on high/ultra on a 1440p/144hz monitor this is a decent card (per GPU-Z: my card never exceeds 83'C (hot spots), GPU ~80'C max temp). if you can find it for under $379 (as of 12/20/19), that's good value. if you can afford it, go 2070S/2080S and you'll never look back.

UPDATE: 12/23/19. Finally figured it out...it was the AMD Radeon Adrenalin 2020 App, so don't install it! It was causing black screens during games, freezing game, disconnecting from monitor. Uninstalled it and all that goes away, in fact, GPUZ says my 'hotspot temp' dropped a couple degrees. Only load up latest Radeon drivers, Windows and BIOS; don't touch any AMD add on apps (ie. Adrenalin or Ryzen Master crap). I still have buyers remorse, I should have stayed Nvidia and got a RTX2070S :(

UPDATE: 3/10/20. I did it. I bought an EVGA RTX2080Super; I know...for the price of the Sapphire Pulse and the EVGA 2080S, I could have bought a RTX2080Ti, not my first stupid mistake, but it's the last time I buy an AMD GPU. I'll try to resell the Pulse RX5700XT to recoup some of the cost. I'm sure it's a great graphic card for some ppl for what they want, but it keeps crashing on the games I like to play...right in the middle of comp games, so I'm very sorry AMD; you make great CPU's and I think the GPU hardware is good but the drivers are unstable when a game or application push your GPU -->black screen/freeze/bsod, take your pick. All those artifacts on my screen that I thought were incompatibility issues -gone- I can now view 4k/120hz video on my 2k monitor without any stutter or lag. If I sound bitter, I am, this experiment cost me over $1200 and I never want to see another AMD GPU again!! This is me signing off, best of luck."

When I am playing games without issues, the performance I get is amazing.

I went from dual R9 390x's that never caused any instability to lock ups, crashes and not waking from sleep properly.

One thing I can help you with. If you're getting a black screen and full system lock shortly after launching a game, make sure you are using no monitoring software. For some reason anything like afterburner, wattman, etc does not play well with this card. Unfortunately their proprietary software isn't fully working yet for this card either.

I mentioned before the card won't wake up properly from a system sleep state. I have to physically remove the display port cable and plug it back in and it works. Annoying.

If drivers get better, I'll amend my review. Unfortunately with crashes and restarts required almost daily, I am disappointed with this card.

EDIT: Months later and drivers got WORSE. Constant lock ups and black screen errors, multiple times per day. I am horribly disappointed and regret every day that I bought this card."

Update to review!,"Upgraded from a 1060 6gb Superclocked. At stock settings it runs quiet and cool. Looking at Globalwattman does have me concerned about the junction temp , which NVIDIA never shows on their monitoring software. I figured all of the youtubers say its fine so it is. AMD is not famous for its drivers though and it shows. The drivers , even the latest driver as of today 19.2.3, is buggy. At least over time there will be performance gains, unlike NVIDIA where they seemingly gimp their older hardware.

This card easily beats a 1080. Matches a 2070 /super in some titles. Im still messing around with clocking and undervolting it so it runs cooler but again the drivers are wonky and the thing wont boost to the clocks I set it to boost to. Its easier to just leave that on auto and ramp up some fan curve for better cooling. I do recommend maxing out the memory clock If you can. It makes all the difference. Also don't operate in hot rooms. Seems like there is an exponential increase in temps if your room isn't in standard room temperature , 69f-77f.

Update!

In order for this GPU to work properly you will have to have it operate at 1440p or higher resolutions. The card simply wont boost at 1080p. Also sometimes the card will drop boost even at stock settings , which is when you go into your Wattman and change your clocks to your stable undervolt settings or back up to stock. It seems as when you run into a frame drop that stays low you need to go in Wattman and change the profile to another setting for it to fix the boost malfunction. Always run the latest driver. Always use Enhanced Sync and do not use freesync. Freesync causes latency and you don't want that in competitive games.

When you buy AMD it is because you know what you are doing and know how to tinker with hardware. If you buy Nvidia you pretty much just stick it into your motherboard and play.

I like this GPU. It runs quiet. It runs fairly cool at a standard ambient temp room. It undervolts easily(anyone can do it without worrying about messing something up) for further cooling. Tons of guides online to help you out with any problems.

Buying this GPU right now is a good choice compared to other competitors around this price point. No raytracing? that's ok. There is no game out there today or in the near future that is going to require it. Nvidia and AMD are nowhere near capable of actually being able to harness full Ray tracing in their cards. Simply, there is no game out there that has the whole game ray traced. Maybe water reflection or certain shadows for a tree may be ray traced but nothing else in the game is for example."
16.0,Sapphire 11293-01-20G Radeon Pulse RX 5700 Xt 8GB GDDR6 HDMI/ TRIPLE DP OC w/ Backplate (UEFI) PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card,SAPPHIRE,AMD,1.4 GHz,8 GB,$42.56,4.4 out of 5 stars,"Very fast and no issues, would highly recommend","I have tried this with:
-Wolcen
-Nier: Automata
-Grim Dawn
-Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
-Witcher 3
-Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
-Lords of the Fallen
-Tomb Raider
-Darksiders 1 and 2

No issues running any of these games 1440p maxed out and it is quiet and very fast. The Radeon Software had an update available the day I got this, which appareantly fixed many issues gamers were having with the 5700XT.

This was a definite improvment over my Nvidia GTX 1080 and operates at PCI-Express 4.0 on my Gigabyte Aorus Master X570 motherboard. You can game at 1440P and some titles on 4K with reduced graphic settings. I suggest 1440p maxed out, how I run all of my games.

Dual BIOS, nice looks, the Sapphire logo glows red (not adjustable). This runs quiet and the temperatures are kept in check well by the cooling system. I would highly recommend this card, even over more expensive cards, as they are still limited to 1440p and you will be paying for slightly more frames $100 to $800 more. The most expensive card out right now only is 25-30% faster and costs 3 times as much. That same card is only 10 fps faster in some titles."

That's ALMOST over the hump,"To start out, this card really gets you dollar for dollar performance and then some, worth every penny. Runs AAA games at >100fps @ 1440p like its a mission from god himself... BUT it still needs work on AMD's end to correct the drivers. NO, I have not had a single BSOD or anything that would make a normal boy cry after spending a good chunk of his hard earned pesos, but there are some stuttering issues that need to be addressed. Now, this does not happen often, but its noticeable when you first boot up your favorite shooter and when your card is getting warmed up in the beginning, than it seems to go away. Perhaps its my system. Who knows.

If you play at 1440p this card will make your day, if you play at 1080p(why?) than you'll have even better performance.

One design note I will add, when you try to screw in the card, its a staggering struggle because of the sheer size of the card. Very difficult to put in the screw. SO difficult I just decided not to put it in."

Even though Mesa 19.2 was supposed to support this card, it's an unusable experience.

Constant crashes even with patches applied, I can't even play games or watch Firefox consistently, absolutely inexcusable from AMD.

Windows is not much better, completely unacceptable product. I returned this GPU on May 2nd after Amazon agreed to accept the return due to the unacceptable situation that is going on with AMD.

Thank you Amazon for accepting the return even though I bought on launch day, because AMD and Sapphire told me to get bent. Thanks Amazon, and I hope you die in a fire AMD and Sapphire.

I have tried Manjaro/Arch and others have tried other distros, same behavior, everyone has issues with this card one way or the other, AMD needs to get this together."

I give this 4 stars however due to the apparent and frequent issues I have bumped into with stuttering, freezing and sometimes display going black with no warning, error message or anything of the sort.

I blame driver instability, as I have overclocked it to a safe and recommended level of performance, and yet it always gets temperamental with me in a game, and usually will just crash. In comparison, I owned a Vega 56 prior to this from Sapphire Pulse and I was able to overclock that card with complete ease (and no crashing). This doesn't have the same methods of overclocking in the drivers' current state for this card.
But out of the box, on default settings, the card truly gets a run for its money, and then some.

Without any major tweaks, your games will run crash-free, quiet, and top notch at Max-Very High settings at 1080-1440p, 60+FPS.

I couldn't recommend it more at this current price performance. Keep in mind, you may win or lose the silicon lottery too, on top of unstable drivers."

What should be an amazing piece of hardware at a great value has been turned into a brick that can't even play video. This is solely the fault of the Radeon graphics drivers. I had black screen lock ups starting in December that made me unable to game or stream with friends. After reinstalling my OS, attempting multiple driver versions with various install processes, applying countless changes in my BIOS and in Windows as well as Radeon settings I still had no resolution. So one component at a time I replaced literally every part of my PC but the case and the issues persisted. This new card was able to run a few synthetic benchmarks but unable to launch any games, locking up my system where only a hard reboot would recover. Again I tried multiple OS reinstalls, various methods to revert or replace graphics drivers and many configurations within BIOS, Windows and Radeon settings. Further, these driver issues are impacting my other computer which uses an AMD APU, and Reddit is crawling with posts from people having the same problem on multiple graphics cards. I regret not trusting the warnings in reviews here and am going to instead get an Nvidia card for the first time in 14 years. Shame on AMD."

I did a lot of research and it decided to get this instead of the Nvidia 2070 Super. I knew that there were driver issues but I thought that is was no big deal and that AMD would release a fix soon for all the problems that people complain.

Since the purchase, about 4 driver updates have been released, in about 2-3 months. and it still shows problems and doesn't get any better. As matter of fact, it is worst. I’m getting less FPS than before, and not just that. My PC crashes and reboots even while not playing, I just happened while I was working on a excel spreadsheet! and I lost all my work!, that was it and now I'm writing this review.

It also runs super hot.

This graphics card went into a brand new pc (new motherboard, case, psu, ram, chip, new windows keys, nvme, etc). I have been building pcs since the 90s. I have built over 15 pcs in my lifettime and have upgraded graphics cards on several pcs.

My build is a 3950x, corsair 750 psu, corsair ram, samsung drives, asus motherboard.

The card that is shown here is different than the one sent to me. In fact the one sent to me is not even on sapphire's website at the time of purchase. It is a triple fan model.

I have not even tried gaming with this pc because it crashes when I am watching netflix, youtube, etc. God help me if I try to run an emulator. I have never had so many issues with pc as this one and it mainly due to AMD drivers and hardware issues with this card. I have tried 4 versions of drivers, I have tried installing with the radeon software, I have tried using guru's DDU to do clean uninstalls. I have tried everything I could think of including changing my pci to 3rd gen in BIOS. I have had these issues since I built this pc in January and its April now.

I will never buy AMD or Sapphire again. I have had more crashes in 1 week from hardware issues than I had in my last 4 computers combined. Never again."

After installing the device in my PC, updating drivers and following all of the steps from the quick guide and troubleshooting reddits, etc., this card is an incomplete product.

First: It is loud. I waited specifically for a quiter version of the 5700xt because everyone stated the blower cards were to loud, well blower style cards must be air horns because if I so much as open a Chrome or Firefox tab this card starts blowing extremely loud.

Second: It doesn't play games or even stream something as simple as Youtube or Twitch. The card will begin to boot up and IF it loads the game, it will quickly freeze and kill the monitor with a 'no display input' error. I have to start the machine up three-five times before it will load into a game and then it is a matter of how much work the card has to do.

I have contacted Amazon and they state the card is not for refund because there's a window the product must be returned in (despite the card having constant driver issues that I was told will eventually be worked out) and the manufacturer states they do not consider refunds, I need to refer back to the retailer.

I won't buy AMD in the future. I waited specifically for these cards and processors and I've received nothing but headache and empty driver promises.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AND BUY NVIDIA."

This is common for ANY video card and should not base your decision on buying this card ( or really any GPU that is new ).

It's been a year and driver issues have been taken care of (honestly they were taken care of within the first month) and the thing is a BEAST if you are looking for a great GPU that can take a beating and keep on going. I have used Sapphire Tech GPUs since I have started PC rig building in the early 2000ks and have YET to be disappointed with them. Last Sapphire card I had was an RX580 8G crossfired with another 580 and that set up lasted me four years and I just wanted a new toy haha !

5700 XT is easy to install and easy to OC. Word of warning though: This card is huge like the original XBOX so make sure you have space in your case ! No cooling issues, unlike MSI or other brands where you have to remove the heatsink and reapply pads or paste. I have NEVER had to do that with any Sapphire GPUs.

Sapphire, you are awesome and thank you for sticking with making Radeon GPUs !"

When I first installed it I got a few crashes and sluggish performance but I was on an old b350 motherboard. I upgraded my motherboard to an x570 that I got used off of amazon that looked brand new for $122 and it performs perfectly with no hiccups (MSI MPG x570 Gaming X). Not one crash and every game I've tried runs smooth on Ultra settings at great frame rates. Maybe the crashing and poor performance issues are coming from old slow motherboards paired with an extremely fast graphics card. The only downside to this card is it runs a little hot around 88C. I just adjusted the fan speed up slightly and it fixed that issue. The default fan settings are really low for some reason. I just set the last fan speed to around 65% and it runs around 75C at full load. My case kind of sucks for cooling anyways so that probably plays a factor in it running hot. But I would definitely recommend this card as long as you have a newer motherboard.

I purchased this in January 2020 and driver stability has been very good, for those who have hesitated on buying this card because of driver issues it looks like most have been fixed.

Upgraded from a Sapphire RX 580 pulse, and this is literally night and day, I’m able to get 60fps on most all triple A game titles, on ultra or high settings, on a 1440p monitor and it is fantastic.

One thing worth noting: Be sure to uninstall your AMD graphics drivers BEFORE installing the new graphics card, and reinstall the drivers once you’ve swapped it out. This should help with most driver bugs.

Also, please watch out on when your delivery is made. Amazon delivered mine with no box, making it a super easy payday for porch thieves. Thankfully I was home at the time for delivery but very very disappointed in Amazons warehouse for sending it with now box."

I'll come back and update this review once a month to give people a good view on the pro's and con's of the card. So as of 07/28/2020:

Pro's:

This card runs to the same if not equal to a 2070 or a 2080

Graphics and graphics processor on this thing is amazing

It can play most AAA games at 1400p with 90 - 100+ FPS and most AAA games at 4k around 40 - 60 FPS

When 8k starts becoming a bigger thing this card will be able to support the resolution

Really quiet, I personally haven't heard a peep from this card

Supports VR

Con's:

If you want a card that works straight out of the box and does not require any tinkering go with Nvidia.

This card, although great, will require some tinkering and googling due to a couple of driver issues (this personally did not bother me. But I can see how it could bother other people)

Tl;Dr: If you are ok with doing some tinkering and googling this is a very solid card. IMO, once the driver issues are fixed so the card is ready right out the box Nvidia is going to finally have some serious competition."

Cheaper than most 5700 XT variants yet keeps up (and outperforms some) with more expensive versions in cooling and performance.
Performance: Handling any game at 1440p 144 hz (CPU: R7 2700x, Precision Overdrive on). To hit 144 hz in more graphically intense titles you may need to lower the settings a bit, but playable by all standards.
Cooling: I set the fans on auto curve with MSI Afterburner and the fans never got to a speed that I can hear. Temps never got over 75 degrees Celsius during gaming.
Sapphire Trixx: Bonus feature that does what it is advertised to do. Go to Sapphire's official page to learn more about that.
Conclusion: At the time of this review, have had 0 problems and it has performed just as expected. Would recommend."

I bought this for GPU rendering and it hasn't disappointed me yet, however keep in mind that if you plan on buying this for a GPU rendering rig might want to consider an NVIDIA 2070 or 2070ti nothing less than that. Reason I say that is because most engines don't support AMD....yet, so like for example in Maya 2020 the new Arnold will let you do GPU rendering but only supports Nvidia. I have been using AMDs ProRender for my GPU rendering fix oh and VRay Next workss too if memory serves. Now why did I only put 4 stars, simply because with the AMD promotion Raise the Game Amazon never fulfilled their end of the bargain and I never got my free game despite the numerous attempts at customer service all leading to the same conclusion that they can't do anything about it and it's on the marketing department who STILL yet to contact me and it's been 2 months now. Best advice is whenever it comes to promotions stay away from Amazon you're better off going with Newegg, they literally give you no trouble about it.

Video performance on this machine was terrible (under both Fedora and Kubuntu), when scrolling websites with a lot of text -- let alone pictures or video -- there was obvious shearing in the image, because (as it true for the most part) on-board video is usually terrible as it usually uses system memory for video. I could open a Konsole window and watch it repaint when moving it to another part of the screen.

Then I bought this video card, and this machine is so much more usable. Konsole windows move around quickly, I'm not seeing any shearing at all - even on content intensive websites, and gaming performance is much better as well.

If you're running a box that only has the onboard video, this card is an immediate, noticeable upgrade in performance that isn't going to break the bank.

Because my onboard video chip set was already an ATI processor, this card just snapped in and worked - no driver upgrade was required. If you are running a lesser operating system like Windows you may need to download and upgrade drivers.

Speaking of drivers, no driver CD was included, so if you're running a lesser operating system like Windows you're likely going to have to download drivers."

Best solution is just shut down between uses. This would have been 5-star, were it not for driver glitch."

AMD works with the open source community which means the open source drivers for their cards are plug and play with Linux. with nVidia cards, you have to use nVidia's proprietary driver since the open source one isn't very good compared to AMD's.

i repaced an nVidia card with this one because i prefer open source drivers and those are built into the Linux kernel and are plug and play. all i had to do was remove the old card, put this one in and reboot. done.

nVidia's proprietary driver worked well in Linux but i don't trust binary blob closed source software/drivers. you never know what they are up to behind the scenes........"

I had already tried 2 other video cards, plus the built-in graphics. I was starting to think it might not be possible due to some intrinsic detail of the hardware. I lost track of how many times I had the case open aand how many times I tried to install different drivers.

I finally gave up on the Visiontek Radeon 5450 and ordered a PNY NVIDIA Geforce GT 730.

Nearly gave up, but, in a last ditch effort, downloaded their latest driver, even tho they do not list the GT 730 as one of the cards it works with and plugged the computer into the internet.

I got it working and it's GREAT!

The screen is wide enuff to have 2 side-by-side windows open without overlap. You can see wide pictures without having to shrink them to unsatisfying vertical size. And I added a second screen to put the file window, tools, and layers for Adobe Photoshop on, leaving the entire picture unobstructed!

Long post, but hopefully, this post will save some future widescreen purchasers with old Dell computers a bunch of time and frustration and maybe it will work for other brands.

If you Google 'Dell Optiplex widescreen' you will see alot of people looking for help, but not many posts saying their problem is solved. I was surprised to see this problem going back to the early 2000s! Apparently, there were wide format monitors before HD TV. I didn't find anything that was specific enuff to help me.

One thing to keep in mind here is that I do not have the Optiplex connected to the internet. Windows is like The Bubble Boy - no immune system! It works fine as long as it is isolated from the environment, but put it online and, between Microsoft 'updating' it and a virtual swamp of malware, it will gradually degenerate into a useless hulk. All the McAfee, Norton and other brand security software can only delay it and will slow everything down from the moment you install them.

Around 2012, I got my previous computer, an Optiplex 755 and also got a Toshiba NB505 netbook specifically to get on the web. Both had Win7. The NB505 worked great at first, but after about 4 months, had slowed to a crawl. The usual history clearing and defragging didn't help, so I did a reformat. That helped alot, but is a major hassle, even with having hardly anything on the computer. Over the next 2 or 3 years, this cycle repeated several times. At 1 point, after getting a blue screen ransom attack, I reformatted and even put Norton on it. (about 50 bucks!) It was never like new after that. Slow, and always having things interrupted by Norton.

But eventually, it got so slow, even after complete reinstall of the OS, that I gave up and tried putting a Linux OS on it. Not being a software nerd, it did not work out well for me. It could sorta access the internet, but everything was very basic and crude looking. Some websites wouldn't even open. By then Google Chrome was available so I got a Chromebook.

Meanwhile, the Optiplex 755 was perfectly healthy. Maybe once or twice a year I did a defrag, but that's it. And it stayed that way till a few months ago. (August 2020) I'm totally digressing here, so I'll shorten the story of what happened to: I got another Optiplex 755 with Win10 on it and connected both of them to the same monitors and keyboard. Either the Win10 (connected to the internet) killed it thru the connections or the Vizio TV somehow zapped it thru the HDMI cable. I still don't know. Evidence for both theories.

All this is to say that part of the problem of getting a video driver to install is because the machine is not connected to the internet. There are a variety of Windows things that need to be updated in order for the video card drivers to install and work.

To help with Google searches, I will restate some of the basic info:

I have a Dell Optiplex 760 with Win7 Pro 64bit and got a new LG 29WK50S, which is a 21:9 ultrawidescreen computer monitor. (29"", 2560 x 1080) It came with a disc, which you would assume has the driver on it, but does not. It only has safety warnings, warranty info and legal junk. A complete waste of time, don't bother sticking it in your player. And don't bother going to their website. No help at all.

After many wasted hours, I gave up on the Radeon 5450 video card and got a PNY NVIDIA Geforce GT 730. It came with a disk that had the driver and other software, but also failed to install. It would get to the point where you restart the computer and during boot up, Windows reinstalls the standard driver which blocks the new driver from being installed.

So, I went to the NVIDIA website and got the most recent driver for the GT 730. There was also something from Microsoft, NT 4.0, that I supposedly needed and got that. Still no driver install. Another 2 hours wasted.

I gave up for a few days. I have a much more important project to work on. (I'm making UVC pathogen killer helmet and face mask prototypes).

When I got back on it, I tried installing the most recent 2020 Geforce driver, even tho it wasn't listed as applicable to the older 'legacy' GT 730. It got farther, but still failed. I tried a few more times but finally decided to risk connecting the computer to the internet.

That worked.

It automatically downloaded a bunch of stuff from Microsoft and NVIDIA, then restarted with the LG ultrawidescreen at its proper 2560 x 1080 rez. And the old ViewSonic screen was on now!

I immediately pulled the internet cable out.

The conclusion is that if you want to use a widescreen on a Win7 computer, you are going to have to risk some updates from Microsoft. I have heard many stories of them 'Win10ifying' older OS versions, forcing people to lose older software and have to be on the web, so be careful. My ancient edition of Adobe Photoshop, for example, will not work in Win10.

In my opinion, LG gets the lion's share of blame for this, considering that it's their product that needs to work with the hardware that's out there. I imagine they must be getting a bunch of returns from disgruntled customers. They did a great job on the hardware, but dropped the ball on the software. Actually, they never even picked it up!

Maybe PNY, Dell, AMD, LG or anybody can take this as an opportunity to develop a universal driver package that works for a wide variety of configurations and situations. I would have gladly payed 20$ for such a thing to save myself a barge load of time."

I used one of these in a full height case with VGA. I used a 2nd one in a half-height case with a single slot and could not use the VGA, so I used a DVI to VGA Adapter (DVIBGAMFBK) sold here on Amazon, and I could not see any of the sides of the display i.e. the icons on the left were too far left, the bottom status bar including the start menu was off the screen and the icons at the top were too far to the top. So I found the DVI cable that came with the monitor and used it, until I could drill a hole in the ITX case for the VGA connector.

On a whim I tried a graphics card made by a different company, but both were the HD5450 silent cards and with the new card I was able to use the DVI to VGA adapter. So there is a definite issue with the DVI connector on this VisionTek when used with a DVI to VGA adapter. I will use in a full height case in the future

Original Review July 5, 2020
I had to add a SATA controller to our Linux PC's although all of our graphics cards were single slot, one machine actually occupied 2 slots even thought the slot cover on the back was for a single slot. I don't understand why some companies have to make their fan shroud so large that it occupies two slots.

Enter the VisionTek 5450 which has a heat sink that only occupies one slot. The card works great in Linux and in Windows (we are not gaming people) and some of our Linux machines dual boot to Windows. This card works great in both operating systems."

It has resulted in higher benchmarks and even the mouse pointer is smoother. It's nice and quiet due to the large heatsink and no fan. Windows 7 didn't have an adequate driver for this device and the CD failed to read properly so I had to go fetch the drivers from the manufactures site. Pretty quick and painless overall.
I loaded a Linux LiveDVD into the machine and Linux recognized this device and loaded the correct drivers for it.
I don't currently use the DVI or HDMI functions of this device but their there when needed.
Inexpensive and works great."

After looking to see: 1) what Amazon had to offer that fit the application, 2) could be delivered fast, and 3) was budget-friendly, this card fit the bill. The card was a direct replacement for the machine's PCI-e x16 slot and I knew going in that since this wasn't for a small form factor (SFF) case, I would need to practice some bracketology by using a SFF bracket kit sold here on Amazon. Once installed, Win10 Pro automatically loaded the correct drivers and the card does provide dual monitor support with separate images on each screen. In my case, I'm running DVI to one monitor and HDMI to the other. Both monitors are Asus VS248 24-in. I'm not sure about gaming, but this card does fine for most desktop applications including some light video editing with Adobe Premiere Rush and handles MS office apps well. With dual monitor support, it also allows me to watch the morning news on Xfinity streaming on one screen while getting a start on the day's Email in Outlook. One last thing: This card does not have a fan, but instead uses a large heatsink for GPU cooling. This cuts down on the noise from the PC, which I like. As with any PC, periodically vacuum the accumulated dust from inside of the PC case to keep the heatsink clean, along with the rest of the internal components. Overall this card is a great value and a huge upgrade in video memory from 256MB to 2 GB!"

The agent was on the phone for over 1/2 hour walking me thru removing the old drivers as the HIS card was also an AMD based product. Used the special cleanup utility and all is well. Running through an old KVM my system thinks it's pushing 2560x1600 but it's actually just below that. Once again - support was phenomenal.

It does not! Any simple card can do what this card does. You have to run this card in conjunction with another card or on board video. Catalyst and Crimson software can't help. Windows 7-10 does the trick all by itself. You can run ""Mirrored"" monitors but as far as ""dual"" monitors with extended desktop is not an option at all. So what's the use? Plug a VGA/DVI monitor in the card and plug the 2nd Monitor into the stock graphics card and let windows do the work. For the price, It does the trick when sharing the on board video card to extend the desktop. For the price it is fine but the marketing is BS sucks. It would be 5 stars if it even came close to the marketing BS. I would buy again now that I understand the reality of this card."

This has lead to a massive GPU shortage, and as a result this is one of the least expensive GTX 1060s in stock.

The GPU performs well and stays relatively cool. At full load with Furmark, my card maxes out at 69 degrees Celsius. My PC case has five 120mm fans in use to keep air flowing, but it is also closed off inside of a compartment of my desk that constricts airflow.

So far, this GPU has run every game at 1080p with max settings easily. In Fallout 4, I maxed all settings and the GPU hit 80% usage at its highest. I also tried Tomb Raider (2012), Fable III, and Shogun II: Total War. All ran perfectly with maxed settings.

It should be noted there is an error on the product description. The GPU's 6GB of RAM operates at 8Gbps, not 9Gbps. There are two versions of this card that are essentially the same. This model is Rev. 2, and it is has 8Gbps memory from Micron. The Rev. 1 model is the one with 9Gbps memory. The performance difference isn't huge between the two, but make sure you know which one you are buying. I kicked one star off for that, because I thought I was getting the 9Gbps model. I'm pleased enough with the card not to want to return it though.

Also, it is worth noting that this GPU comes with no accessories at all. You get a GPU, a single sheet of paper with instructions on how to put the GPU in your PC, and a driver CD. You don't get any cables, PCI-E adapters or cable adapters. This is somewhat unusual. These items are inexpensive, so it isn't a serious issue, but kind of cheap of Gigabyte not to put any."

I stressed a lot about which GPU to get for my recent build, after 3 months I am very pleased with the performance of this one. I get a stable 60fps on very high or ultra settings on everything I've played so far except the Witcher 3 on ultra dips down to 54 off and on but stays right at 60 on high, and that is limited by my 60hz monitor and capped by v-sync.
The hottest it's gotten is 65c after about 8 hours of gaming.
Hardly makes any noise at all, even under load. Unless you have your side panel off and your ear next to it you won't hear it.

In my opinion if you are running things at 1080p on a 60hz monitor, this is the nicest card I would buy. If I had had another 800 dollars to toss away on top of the 1600 I spent on my build I would have upped the GPU to a GTX 1080ti and bought 144hz monitor.
As a daily but casual gamer who largely enjoys games for being a visual spectacle, I am happy with this card. So far I have played Dying Light, The Evil Within 2, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, Dishonored 2, and am just starting the Witcher 3 and they all run buttery smooth. I'm sure side by side with a top tier build you would see a substantial gain, but you get what you pay for, and this is a good bang for your buck.
Highly recommend.

I run my card at 60% power ...,"As someone else stated it is true. you can not overclock this too hard. I can only get memory to +600 and have it be stable, after that instability sets it. As for core I find it hard to go over +100 in most cases. But +100 gets me to 2.07 ghz so thats actually pretty good. I run my card at 60% power limit and have no issues running any game at 1080p. I have not tried 4k or 1440p but I am sure it will perform ok, the 3gb is probably a limiting factor. Also for those who don't know the 3gb versions of the 1060 have 1152 cuda cores vs 1280 you get from the 6gb version. Because of this it has a little less performance. On a side note the card runs very cool, it is also massive. I also have a gigabyte 1060 windforce card which is significantly smaller than this card. This card also uses an 8pin power connector instead of the 6pin. For what it is and the price point it is a very good card. If you are just wanting to do 1080p gaming its hard to pass this card up. It is probably the best bang for buck of any gtx 1060 3gb card out. Also is very power efficient. I have seen a delta of about 85W on full load. Overall great card. Also, when I use afterbuner i notice that setting power limit to 60% actually results in a limit of about 68, to hit the 60% limit mark you need to set it to 50% in afterburner. You also don't loose much performance when you do that. So cheers."

The 1050 is a great card but the performance difference is huge while the price difference was moderate. The 1070 is an excellent card but it would end up costing more than my entire computer. Most of the Nvdia 1060 GPUs are roughly the same regardless of the maker. The main difference is the fans/cooling, the appearance, and the ports. This gigabyte offers dual fans that supposedly offer more cooling due to the fan design. I am not sure if its true but the temps have been fairly consistent and the fan is very quiet. Keep in mind that with minimal to moderate use the fans do not come on at all (unlike GPUs of the past) once you reach a certain degree of use the fans will ramp up as needed. Also worth noting is that this generation of Nvida cards have ""auto overclocking"" which means they can adjust their frequency depending on how you are using it. This has worked out very well so far with the card humming with light apps at less than 400mhz and then going to full clock with heavy games. The temperatures are reasonable (about 66 degrees at full load) and the performance has been spotless with my Core i5 setup.

The only real downside to this is that it comes with no accessories. Back in the day I recall GPUs coming with connectors adapters to allow you to use different types of monitors. This GPU has 1 HDMI, 1 DVI, and 3 display Ports. I would have much rather had more HDMI or DVI output or this could have come with adapters to allow you to switch but unfortunately I had to purchase the adapters myself.

As long as you are ok with the ports then you won't be disappointed with the card."

The primary reason being the amount of vram (gddr5). This 1060 has 6gb of vram, which, as graphical needs increase over time, should last for a good few years. I use this card for about 8 or 9 hours a day, and i use it for gaming and game development in unity. The card works as expected and has no issues running games such as fortnite at 120 fps high settings. you can run ultra as well but you're going to want to cap the frames to 60 fps as to reduce frame drops. Unity runs very well, and is far better at building scenes and generating lighting(which was the biggest problem i had with my 750 ti).

pros -
6 gigabytes of vram.

2 DVI ports to support dual monitors(i tested to ensure this works on windows 10, it does)

Dual fans for better cooling. if you buy a 1060 i really recommend buying one with dual fans. it'll last much longer if cooled more adequately. i was worried mine would have cooling problems as i have a small case in a room thats usually about 74 to 75 degrees fahrenheit. but interestingly it only reached 107 fahrenheit under load. which for a gpu is not bad.

cons - none really ;)

pretty standard situation here. its a great card of course but it wont function as well as cards higher in the price range, which is to be expected.
but for 300 USD this will do everything. i have not tested this against its amd counter part the rx 580/480 or with VR. Though its supposed to support it.

It all comes down to what you need in a graphics card. This card can handle just about everything and is a great all around gpu.

Like i said its a great card i have had it for a week now and have had no problems so far. I also own a 1060 3gb in my other system, its almost equally as good as the 6gb card but will most likely be hindered by its 3gb of vram in the near future, so I highly recommend this gpu."

Now, after installing this card it takes any game I throw at it like it was nothing; I can play any game I have using Very High or Ultra settings with no problems.

I've knocked off one star because this card is HUGE, by huge I mean HUGE; if you do not have a large mid sized tower or full size case do not even attempt to install this card. On top of the large size the fan housing actually sticks out into the 3rd slot and can interfere with any cables that you may have in that area. For example, in my case the fan housing interfered with all of the SATA cables that were plugged into the motherboard. I had to find an alternative SATA port on my board and buy a L shaped SATA cable to overcome the issue.

Other than the size of the card it's fantastic, I've been running it for several weeks now and the card has handled everything I've thrown at it. Dishonored 2 was unplayable before and now I can run it in ultra settings, Prey is now running on Very High with no problems at all. Older games like Civ, Galactic Civilizations, etc. run with no problems at all.

Buy it if you have the room."

and when the fans are on you don’t even noticed I maxed mine out and more quiet then the gt730 so that’s an extreme plus

the size of the card is massive hahaha better have room I sure do in my thermaltake core X71 case

and do keep in mind minimal this card requires 400w or higher states on the box mine work perfectly 600w gold by thermaltake

So now the rgb holy child programming it’s so terrible it’s just awfully made can’t use wheel have to use pre made colors app on phones is even worse 😂 so I just keep mine on blue or one solid color

The rest of the application is eh needs major improvement the card is perfect now they need to work on the application improve features looks ability’s and soo on other then that application can be dealt with when used when OC for example this card is very powerful

Installing was perfect even with the led to inform if something is wrong with the power amazing

The backplate Is metal and connects to the front face

The heat sinks are very I interesting and noticeable slightly

Symbols for gigabyte and fan stop are spot on and beautiful

The panel where the hdmi and display ports are it’s actually a dark grayish color not pure silver hahaha

I will post videos tomorrow!!!!!

One update and I was ready to game list below is what I’ve played on max settings so far will keep updating

Fortnite on epic
Subnatica on maxed
The forest on max
RoE on max
Gta 5 on high
The hunter call of the wild maxed
Battlefield V

Update 1-12-2019

Application has been updated and now I can choose what ever color I want

the overclock part is still wow not worth it I uninstalled gigabytes overclock saved the rgb fusion 2.0 and downloaded msi after burner

I will say however check your thermal pads and paste my pads where dry a little bit so I changed them and the paste was dry too

But amazing card this thing can handle any game you can through at it"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the card itself has been doing pretty alright while running msi afterburner but before I realized I needed that (newly built pc), my computer would force shut off in the middle of games. And I'd be like dafaq. One of my troubleshooting look arounds I launched the software that comes with the card, wouldn't boot despite it showing in task manager as running *which is why I thought it was working to begin with.* Deleted then reinstalled the software twice once from disc again the other from the site, NOTHING still. Long story short my GPU was overheating cuz this crap software wasn't working. Which personally bothers me cuz I like streamlined all in one type of deals so having to install another companies software to make sure my fans spin so it doesn't overheat is kinda a bummer."

I've gone through three of them and the last one went up in literal flames.

By comparison the 1060 is almost indistinguishable. In Overwatch at 1440x950 I can tell it's not a Titan or 1080, but it's plenty of graphics card for competitive matches. I must admit that's the most hardware-intensive game I play, so I can't tell you a whole lot about game performance, but for the price it's fantastic. I also loaned the card to a friend who had the same 970 issue I did, and he was mostly happy playing on twin monitors. His complaint was that the PC was not able to sleep/wake correctly with this card, but in fairness he was waiting for his 970 to come back from RMA and didn't spend a lot of time tuning the system for a temporary card.

I really like the card for two reasons. First, it's small and doesn't stress the motherboard like the behemoth I took out. And second, it's more fuel-efficient than my 970 was, with a single six-pin power connector and less cooling hardware, which means fewer watts (and hopefully less risk of fire!) burned by my PC. I've bought a second one for my workshop machine in case I want to run a few quick matches when I'm bored.

I know it's all about RTX these days but if you just want a cheap gaming adaptor this will do it."

I had ordered a 3GB MSI GeForce GTX card from another company (thru Amazon), waited for two weeks, was then told it got lost somewhere (I tracked it to the east coast - I live in CA), at least I never got it. SO, I ordered this 6GB Gigabyte GeForce GTX card. Got it 2 days later, installed it the next day and it works GREAT. Was very easy to install and the software that came with it works great too, also easy to install.
This card has 3 settings for overclocking the card that are already set. It has an additional one that allows you to enter several user defined overclock settings. It gives you the ability to monitor the card memory, temp, speed as well as the GPU and even your CPU Temps.
Compared to the GTX 950 2GB card it replaced it runs every game I have at max settings, with ease (the 950 could not run some of my games at max settings without some tearing and lagging). I love it so far and would recommend it to any gamer up to an intermediate level (maybe beyond - depending on the games). It does take two card slots and uses the 6 pin external power connecter on the end of the card. It fit well in my ATX case, does not crowd the HDs or SDDs installed. I run games such as the Division2 and Tom Clancy's Wildlands and this card runs them all with no lagging or tearing at max settings. It says it is VR ready but I do not have any VR games for the PC yet.
My system runs windows 10, on an Intel I-7 6700, 4.5GZ with 16GB of ram.

Although I had some installation issues (not related to the card - my computer just needed an upgraded power supply to handle it, and a bigger case would have made installation a LOT easier), the card booted up first time, and after taking forever to download the drivers (Nvidia's fault, not the card's) has worked excellently. My games look great and run nice and smoothly. A lot of gaming or video watching will heat up the room, though.

Second part, reviewing this company. This product came with an advertised rebate, available within 5 to 7 weeks after they received all the paperwork (aren't all rebates 4 to 6? And why does it take a month to mail a bleepin' gift card to your customer?) Even though I submitted the information weeks before, they gave me a confirmation date of 6/4, meaning I should get the rebate by mid-July. Of course, nothing happened, and when I reached out again, they said that ""due to system error"" I had been given the wrong deadline; it would take 8 to 10 weeks to get me my lousy rebate gift card. Well, today is exactly 10 weeks later. Care to make a wager as to whether I've received it or not? And to make it even better, the link they gave me to check on the status of my rebate is not a working link. It's only $20, I'll live without it, but I'm done with Gigabyte...lots of other companies sell versions of these cards!"

I play games at 1080p ultra settings on all games well over 60fps, you could even play some games at 1440p high settings. Currently I have this card overclocked to 2ghz and the ram overclocked 40mhz and this card runs very very cool with the three fan setup and with a custom fan curve (that is not silent at all) runs the fans at 79% and keeps the card at 51-52 degrees at full load. You may get better temps in a better airflow case, my case is a nzxt phantom 410 which has ok airflow. Without a custom fan curve the card will run hotter at around 65 degrees but turning off the custom fan curve will make your card turn down it's overclock as a safety precaution to not crash your video driver but you may be able to overclock it more and achieve 2ghz without the custom fan curve I personally haven't tried that yet. The card itself overclocks from the factory to about 1960 mhz so overclocking it with software another 40mhz will easily get you to 2ghz which is currently my overclock but your mileage may vary because every card is different when it comes to overclocking."

The 770 still works so its always nice to have a spare on hand for troubleshooting.
The card runs around 60c at full load which is really nice. I have Corsair Vengeance C70 with 5 case fans running and is very neat and spacious which contributes to the cooling.

I am also running an 8 core amd FX 8350 with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo with a thin layer of arctic silver and it runs at 26 to 28c on idle and 48 to 53c on full load. For a five year old computer that I built of May 2013, it has brought me joy for years and will keep bringing me joy for years to come. I do not regret using an Asus Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 with 16gb Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1866. This was my first AMD build for my own use, and prior to this build I always stuck to Intel.

Where's the free game bundle?","I bought this card for about $260 in December 2018. It performs as advertised and expected. However, this Gigabyte version of the card is slighty overpriced. You can get a RX 580 8GB card for about $50 to $60 cheaper for nearly the same performance. You can also get a RX 590 for about the same price with better performance.

Main reason I like and bought this card is because it already had two DVI connections, and this is one of the only cards on the market that sells with 2 DVI connections.

I was slightly dissappinted the card has no RGB and doesn’t light up or anything at all. My older Gigabyte R9 390 card I purchased a year earlier lights up and had status modes, plus it cost less.

Also, the card did not come with any free games from Amazon. Apparently, you can buy this card elsewhere and it comes with free game bundles. Check newegg for example.

Card should ultimately cost about $50 to 60 less due to AMD Radeon competition and nVidia’s release of the new next generation video cards including the RTX 2060."

I'm very happy with it. It's super quiet to begin with as the fans normally don't even turn on unless it's over 50% utilization. I used the utility that came with it to manually set the fan speed to 100% to hear the worst case scenario. At 100% you will hear the fans but it's not a whiny noise but a pleasant gentle breeze type noise. My YouTube videos look fantastic at 1080p with this. I bought the 6GB version in case I buy a game or application that needs the extra vram. It's a beautiful looking card also and was easy to install. Happy with it!.

A PC REVIEW!","Day one of using this GPU. I didn't want to pay out the nose for a 20 series card from team green and the 16 series didn't really catch my eye either; so, having a Ryzen CPU, I decided it was time to try out AMD's GPUs.

This thing is a monster, and my GTX 960 wasn't exactly a slouch. It can get a little warm though so make sure your case ventilation is above average.

Battlefield V, DX12, Ultra: 60-90FPS.
Destiny 2, highest settings: 60-100FPS.
Overwatch, epic preset: 90+ FPS.
DOOM 2016, Vulkan, ultra preset: 120+ FPS.
Apex Legends, highest settings: 70-85FPS.
Prey (2017), highest settings: 70-90FPS.
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, highest settings: 60-70FPS

Just buy it, especially if you're on a tight budget and want the most for your dollar. Could've been a bit cheaper since we're on the cusp of the release of the RX5700 partner cards.

This was one of the recommended cards by Apple. As others have mentioned, it does require a dual mini 6 pin to 8 pin adapter cable to power the unit from the mother board. This allow both mini 6 pin power supplies to be combined to juice this card. I couldn't find the right one on Amazon, so I found one on Ebay for 7.95 including shipping and had it in about 4 days.

The card was pretty easy to install. Initially, when I powered up, the computer froze on the gray screen before the Apple logo appears. Just to try something different, I booted up in safe mode and, to my surprise, the card started working flawlessly. Subsequently, I booted up normally and the card works just fine. Unlike some reports, I am able to see the Apple logo and the progress bar on start up, just like normal. I subsequently upgraded the system from High Sierra to Mojave, no problem. Prior to that, I had received the error message during the upgrade indicating that a hardware upgrade was required.

The package has no indication of Mac compatibility and there are no OSX downloads on the Sapphire website. That initially made me nervous, but other people had written that High Sierra could run the card no problem. They were right."

I dropped this in (If course there is no EFI display... was considering sending it to macvidcards to have it flashed...), powered up, refreshed pram, and boom. Worked perfectly in my highly modded Cheese Grater Mac Pro. (5,1 mid 2010).

It's important that you have the REAL 5,1, not the 2009s that were flashed to say 5,1... because you need PCI2.0 to get any performance out of the card at all. the first thing I did was run BruceX... 16.3 seconds... holy fast render batman! Considering the best BruceX time I've ever seen was 11 seconds, thats not bad.

The card os smooth as silk, Final Cut BLAZES, and editing 4k with complex renders and particle effects is now a no brainer. Best$ I've ever spent.

A not to those who use Premier or Resolve, etc.. you probably want an NVIDIA card, since those NLEs use OpenGL, and AMD supports OpenCL. which is what FinalCut Pro X uses...

The card ran perfectly with High Sierra; however, despite being a Metal capable card, with Mojave it would never get past the startup screen (the desert scene) and load the Finder (I will spare you describing all of the dialog boxes that would not respond after logging in, and the process symbol spinning for 9 hours, all while the Finder should have been loading). I spent 6 days in chat and telephone discussions with Apple support; a day at the local Apple Store Genius Bar; and at their recommendation, I took the computer to local authorized Apple expert techs. Among other things the local experts took one of my startup drives, placed it in another computer, installed Mojave on it, put it back in my computer, and could not even get any video whatever. Their conclusion is that the Mojave drivers are completely incompatible with this card.

As mentioned by other commenters, the card has a UEFI firmware interface, while Apple uses EFI. While many UEFI cards will function with Macs (and indeed, this one did great with High Sierra, the predecessor to Mojave), they will not allow display of the Startup Manager, which allows one to select a different startup drive from that selected in the System Preferences. The entire screen is skipped on startup with a UEFI video card that has not been flashed with EFI (at least one card has a switch that allows selection of UEFI or EFI function, but not this one). Lack of access to the Startup Manager prevented the Apple Genius Bar tech from reaching Apple's network troubleshooting tool.

I do not know if the card can be flashed to an EFI configuration, or if doing so would solve the problem. I am returning it (most graciously accepted by the seller), and purchasing a Metal-capable, Mojave compatible card that has been flashed for MAC."

It just happens to work well in a Mac Pro tower. If you get it for the Mac, you MUST buy a two-6 pin to 8 pin adapter cable. The card will NOT work without it.

The two 6 pin connectors go to the logic board and the other end, the 8 pin connector, goes to the video card. I personally recommend connecting the cables to the logic board first, then install the video card, then connect the 8 pin connector to the video card.

You will not see a boot screen (the Apple logo). Instead, the screen will appear on the log in screen or the Finder window. Because of this, keep your old video card handy in case you need to reinstall the operating system or boot from another device.

Because this is a PC video card, do NOT expect instructions for the Mac. They aren’t there. No drivers are necessary for modern versions of Mac OS X including Mojave. Do not use the CD for anything but a drink coaster, or keep it around if you want to use this card in a PC one day.

Once installed, it works beautifully. The card supports resolutions up to 8K! (Make sure your monitor is compatible!) Cinebench and Metal benchmarks give you results comparable to an Nvidia GeForce 1060, which ain’t bad. Metal is fully supported and everything just works.

I purchased this card to replace the Nvidia 750Ti that was in the computer. Nvidia doesn’t have drivers for Mojave making many apps inoperable. This was a great upgrade for a 9 year old computer (Mac Pro 4,1 flashed to 5,1)."

Having already decide to migrate the 1070 (and others) to a generic box to support training models, I bit the bullet and grabbed one of these ""UEFI"" cards. While I was eventually able to (mostly) tame the beast, I'm not at all sure this was the right move.

First, it's only sorta UEFI, which is to say that it doesn't wake up until MacOS is up and has loaded its drivers. Until then it's just a blank screen, which isn't a big deal until the moment you have issues during boot.

Second, it's a fat thing. If there was a card in the slot above this pig, it was guaranteed that it would interfere with the Sapphire's fans. I ended up having to toss the RAID controller out of the machine, because it was either that or the SSD card.

Third and last, speaking of fans, out of the box one of the fans wouldn't rotate. Turns out the power cable for that fan was folded under in such a fashion as to interfere with the fan. Strong work in the Quality Control department.

Oh, and trap for young players: Leave the ""game mode/compute mode"" switch in the default ""game mode"" position; when set to ""compute mode"" Mojave fails to identify the card.

So, when the dust settled, I have a working Mojave-compatible graphics system, but at the price of tossing the RAID controller. There's also some post-boot weirdness, where the display comes up at a lower resolution, but adjusts once you authenticate, after which the correct resolution persists across sessions. Also, the chassis fan now ramps up to 100% during boot and remains there, something that might be corrected by a PRAM reset, but having spent three hours on what should have been a 15 minute project that particular issue is something to be investigated by a future instance of myself.

One unrelated but nevertheless interesting point: during all of this I discovered that, once installed, Mojave is more than happy to boot without a Metal-enabled card installed; while trying to debug this mess I found that Mojave was perfect content talking to the original A1310/GT 120 card with no other video adapters in the box."

Anyway, after a bit of an ordeal, it works great and is well worth it. I've been doing a ton of video and photo editing. I definitely know when it's working because, when I run something intensive (like a big export, video stabilizer, etc.), the fan kicks up. The longest video I've done so far is about an hour and it goes right through. Matter of fact, I don't get any flickering and can still do other tasks while it's pushing out the vids.

I really wanted this card so I could upgrade to Mojave and I would have kept the card even if it would only run on High Sierra.

I could not install the Sapphire card until I purchased a dual male 6 pin to male 8 pin cable on ebay because the Sapphire card needs the power from both of the Mac Pro’s video card power supplies. You also should upgrade to MacOS 10.13.6, High Sierra prior to installing Mojave.

I spent two days using the Sapphire Card: backing up data, ‘just in case’; booting from two different hard drives to verify it worked with both old and new Mac OS’s; and planning the conversion to Mojave.

The Sapphire Card was impressive and worked fine those two days, then in the middle of downloading my new email, everything locked up.

During the prior two days the Sapphire Card never missed a beat but after the lock up it never again displayed anything. It would not even brighten the screen. I could hear the Western Digital hard drive going through the boot up sequences but nothing was ever visible. I booted from the second hard drive, still nothing.

I rechecked the seating of the installed Sapphire Card and the power cables, still nothing.

I removed and re-installed the Sapphire Card, still nothing.

Finally I gave up and re-installed my original Mac Pro display card, everything now works fine using either hard drive.

You MUST BUY A SEPARATE POWER CABLE if you don't have the correct one for your system board.

Although this card is listed on the Apple support pages as supported when upgrading a Mac Pro 2012 to be able to run Mohave, I discovered that, Apple has a separate doc that indicates that you will no longer get EFI boot screens. Also, because the card has a different part number in the bios, you still have to edit the bios if you want to get the card fully recognized by the OS. It affects which frame buffer code gets loaded. It will work unmodified, sans boot screens. If you need the boot screens to update system board bios or select boot/disk utilities you have to put your old card back in. :( Thanks Apple.

There is a problem though, if you connect all the monitors to the Egpu on boot it takes a long time for the Mac to recognize the monitors so I advise people to just connect one to the Mac HDMI port boot and then connect it to the GPU.

The performance is killer and my Mac is now cooler than ever using all the resources for multiprocess and multitasking instead of rendering pixels.

Totally recommend this graphic card to Mac users."

Sapphire is the Apple recommended brand to buy but it could have been user error...Regardless, my setup has never been better and it required minimal to no tweaking of the settings. Got this card when it hit $200 which I think is absolutely a steal for how well this thing runs. I tried Overclocking it a bit and its so far responded perfect.

Honestly, if you are a cMP owner and want a no hassle and high-powered card, get this one. My only complaint is how big the card is. As I said, I had XFX 580 which I thought was too large to fit in the slot. when I received this Sapphire Pulse 580, I went to install it into the PCIe slot and realized its even larger than the XFX one! Make sure you have vertical clearance and don't put anything in the 3rd slot.

I found out what the issue is. It's not the card, it's the fans. They're not heat censored, so therefore they basically work when you're using a lot of things at once, but if you're not using much and it's hot out, it will lag and crash....

Well it was fine while it lasted... Which was about 3 months! Actually I think it started happening about 2 months in, but it's been 3 months so far until I realized it was the card. I thought that it was my internet that was giving me blank screens and freezing, but it turns out it was this card. From reading a lot of the reviews, seems like many are having that same issue. Not sure if they know they're sending out duds, or they just have really bad luck with them because although I got this for about $30 less than what it is now on sale, I feel it was still a rip off because it's only good for a few months and even then it wasn't the best. Was okay, but not the best. I would recommend buying something a little more expensive that will last you a lot longer, but if you're looking for a card that will last for a little while and then freeze a lot, then this is your best choice... I'm disappointed in MSI because they usually have good products, but this was a huge downfall from the high hopes I had about this. Just wish I knew this before I bought it because I would have gladly payed double for something a lot better and would last a lot longer... It's been about 4 months so I can't return it. Just wish they would at least be honest about their products rather than ripping people off. Very disappointing... :("

a huge decrease in frame rate.
After I installed the gtx 1050 oc I was disappointed that I experience only a slight improvement. After trying many different game settings I only got a little more improvement by going for lowest settings. I contacted the seller thru amazon and asked for a refund. That was on a Friday. Over the weekend I watched a youtube video on how to over-clock my gpu using the After-burner utility. The result is that I now have zero issues with the performance I'm getting.

The first 1050 ti I owned was Zotac's OC model, which was a fine card. The only issue with it was that the fans couldn't go any lower than 45% speed, and it was a little too noisy for me at any load. I decided to purchase this card instead as a replacement. Here are my thoughts:

+ The card runs semi-passively under its default fan profile. Even at 35% fan speed, it is completely inaudible in my small custom wooden itx case.
+ It's a 1050 ti- you'd have to try hard to get it to thermal throttle. It runs cool.
+ The aesthetics appeal to me. It's a pretty sharp-looking card.

+/- Is the 6-pin connector really necessary? Zotac's OC card was able to reach pretty high clocks using only motherboard slot power.
+/- At this price point, they could have gone the extra inch to include a backplate. Gigabyte managed to do it with their flagship 1050 ti.

- Speaking of price, it's hard to justify buying this specific card over a cheaper 1050 ti (usually smaller and without a 6-pin) or one of the less robust RX 470's at MSRP."

I took to gaming just ten years ago on my then PS3. I enjoyed the games back then because, they were fun. Today's games are full of loot boxes and other stuff to keep you spending tons of money. I don't like the new monitized games.

I like old sinlge player campaign games like Bioshock 1 and 2, Prototype 1 and 2, RAGE 1 and 2 and more. I like some new games. I can wait till Outter Worlds comes to steam. This MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB is all you need if you are playing older video games.

The single player PC game that shows how well a GPU card works for me is driving the cards in original RAGE! Driving cars in RAGE using this card is fantastic. There is no screen tearing, no artifacts, no lag, no crazy pop in's. The image is smooth. Best of all the overall PC Rage image quality is better than it was on my PS3 and the PS3 was fine.

However if you are seriously into single player titles or older titles this MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB GPU is for you.

Turns out I ran CRYSIS using my MSI Computer Video Graphic Cards GeForce GTX 1050 TI GAMING X 4G, 4GB GPU and it ran fine. No lag or other issues.

This graphics card is massive. You may need to make some adjustments if you have a standard desktop case. I had to crimp down a notch on one of the expansion slots in the back so the card would seat perfectly in the motherboard interface. I just used a small pair of pliers to complete this. Take the time to learn the layout of your chipset and case and be very gentle when installing this card. While it is not flimsy, the card pins on the bottom are somewhat obscured by the fan shroud and headers (yeah, you read that right😁). For some reason, my card didn't come with an installation CD. No big deal. Just go to the NIVIDIA website and download the latest software which optimizes game settings for you. Next thing: power. You'll need at least a 500w power supply. I use the EVGA which comes with a 6 pin molex connector that plugs right into this graphics card. NOTE: if you have anything other than an ATX motherboard, you're going to need a 20+4 pin to P2 adapter which is available right here on Amazon. Now for the fun stuff.
What's your game: Fortnite? Apex Legends? Call of Duty? At GDDR 5 with 4 GB of RAM, this game plays the above games at high and epic settings with ease and runs as quiet as the internal fans. NOTE: this card does tend to whir in a standard desktop case. Not to worry. I just removed the side panel and the card stays cool and very quiet. To add, when you run games like Fortnite on optimal settings, you may experience some freeze frames. THAT'S NOT YOUR GRAPHICS CARD - IT'S YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION. I have experienced this with both ethernet and wireless so I tested the speed of my internet connection and sure enough, I'm just under 10MB which is not optimal for online gaming. Nonetheless, I make due by lowering the settings a bit which compensates well. Lastly, the price point. Hands down, the best card you can buy for the money and performance output which trumps other cards within its price range. Overall, I am very happy with this card. It has revolutionized my gaming experience and I know it will do the same for you."

I bought this card with no intent on every playing games like Project Cars, Dirt 3, Batman Arkham City, FFXIV, and more at anything above low-medium setting. After all it was paired with a Skylake dual-core Pentium processor. Man, was I in for a surprise. While Project Cars and Ghost Recon Wildlands and Max settings at 60 FPS, it CAN run them at 60 FPS and low-mid settings. Older titles like Dirt 3, Batman Arkham series, Need For Speed Most Wanted, and FFXIV for example ran at max settings. Even the Just Cause 1&2 and Saints Row 2-4 all run smoothly at 50+ FPS. Recently got Watch_Dogs and that too ran smoothly, though not at max settings.

So who should get this card? Casual gamers who just want an inexpencive gaming PC instead of a console. ALso, PC gamers looking for a cheap card to game on while they wait for better ones to become affordable. I'm probably upgrading to a 1060 (or just the 1050 ti) this year and I would recomend if you can afford the 1050 ti, get that instead and will hold until you get your 1070s or 1080s."

I've heard that Mystic Light will control the lighting but I'm not going to run another 3rd party program in the background just to have lights. The video card has only red lights anyway and my system is blue so I don't mind them not being on. Of course you can also use MSI Afterburner if you really feel like overclocking this card but it's not necessary. It runs very cool.

I had a similar problem with the MSI GTX 750 Ti low profile card. I took off the fans and found a label on the back.
The fans were made by idcooler.1688.com. The model is listed as XY-D05510S. I went to the website and found that it is all in Chinese. The fans are 50 mm diameter when measured across the blades, 12 volt, 0.28A 4000 rpm, with a 2 pin configuration. It would be nice if I could order replacement fans. But apparently other people are having the same issue. MSI needs to use better fans.

I have built a fan shroud out of .025"" thick aluminum sheet. HD sells it in 6""x18"".

I purchased 50 mm ball bearing fans from amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KRVPYLP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
they are smaller than the original fans. These measure 50mm at the outside of the housing. About 46 mm blade to blade. But the the rpm is listed at 7000.

I purchased a package of connectors from amazon as the connectors on the fans are too large.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07449V33P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The large holes in the aluminum were cut with a jewelers saw. Bending was accomplished with a bench vice, pliers, fingers, and a non marring mallet.

The connectors on the two fans were cut and soldered to a single 2 mm connector.
I had some small shrink tubing that I used to insulate the solder joints
The polarity of the connector had to be reversed as they are wired in opposite to the one on the original fans . A pin was used to lift the plastic tabs that holds the connectors in place and they were swapped red for black.
I have included some photos. Note the position of the fan wires. The red is positive. If you try this. Be sure to wire it correctly. I'm currently running this board and testing it out. I hope that it does well when the weather heats up.

At least now, if a fan dies, I can replace it quick."

It was quite difficult to install into my Acer Aspire ATC-705 desktop, however, and I will describe the process for anyone else who might have that or similar machine. The Aspire has one x16 slot, and one express slot. The cord to the optical drive comes out of the motherboard where the NVIDIA card must slide in place. After removing the side cover and prying the expansion covers loose, it is necessary to disconnect and remove the hard-drive from its bay. Any card in the express slot must also come out. Then the graphics card can be angled and rotated into position, with the optical wiring coming up between the two halves of the card. Then replace and reconnect the hard-drive. There is barely enough room, but it will fit."

Of course during the gaming sessions you'll hear the fan power up but still for the price you can't go wrong with it.

Also, it was shipped with a label slapped on the retail box. No other padding, protection, and not in another box. Also the box was NOT taped shut. I have no way to know if this is new or used since there was no factory seal on it. Even the anti-static bag it was in wasn't sealed.
Final issue: I guess the length seems to be different depending on where you measure from. I measured 7.2"" clearance and this was listed as 7.09"". I'm going to have to do a hardware modification to move my hard drive back to be able to close the lid on the computer as the hard drive rotates down in place and it won't quite clear the end of the card."

It auto overclocks the core on mine to about 2050 Mhz which is a very large overclock compared to the base and default boost in the AMP. And in 3DMark it hits 7,751 for the gpu score.

As for build quality it feels very solid/heavy, it runs cool and like my previous 1060 AMP edition it runs pretty much silent."

It still played everything quite well for under $200, was quiet, didn't take up a lot of space, and didn't even need any extra power beyond what was supplied to the PCIe 3.0 slot. However, with the Shadowbringers DLC for FFXIV on the horizon and a little extra money saved up, I decided to take the plunge on the RTX 2060 for my 1080p gaming needs. Needless to say, I've been completely blown away so far. Consistent 60 FPS on medium to medium-high settings was a pipe dream before on my 1050 ti. Now I'm hitting it with ease on high/max settings in most of the games I play to the point its almost laughable. If I hadn't just purchased a 1080p LG 29"" Ultrawide monitor a couple years ago on sale during Black Friday, I would definitely love to upgrade to a 24""+ 1440p to push this thing further. Long story short, if you were on the fence about upgrading to a GPU that has a fantastic price to performance ratio and were seriously considering a GTX 1070/1070ti, this card is for you. Just don't make the same mistake I did and forget to check your PSU if you have an older rig to ensure it has an 8 pin PCIe cable. Some of them only have 6 pin and will require you upgrade your PSU to get the 8 pin that is needed to run the RTX 2060."

It initially started off as a VERY loud vibration when under stress, and ended up with a clinking noise. It was loud enough to hear over my gaming headset.

It happened literally a week after Amazon's return policy - and it wasn't even under any kind of load during that time. I sparingly used it. I only wish I had used it more, sooner, so that I could have returned it to Amazon.

ZOTAC was kind enough to take it for RMA, however I don't know if they will give me a new card, or even replace the faulty one I was given. And the RMA process is slated to take 30 days after I shipped it to them.

So I'm out a video card for approximately 5 weeks. I will give an update to the score when I receive it from RMA.

Update: New card works great. But took almost a month and a half to receive the new unit from RMA. Updated stars from 1 to 3."

The first time i used this video card best experience ever RTX is worth trying connected it to my 4k Tv quality was superb UHD, I only ended up using it for 4 months it had a artifacting issue this is in 2020 how unlucky but i RMA the card I had purchased (Sold by Amazon) i got my refund easy and good customer service.

Pros:
Any game you throw at it takes it like a champ.
10/10.
I recommend to try the RTX games

Cons:
Its risky a purchase due to the Artifacting issue.
The temp goes up high for its money i don't think its fair enough.

I still recommend buying it if you love good graphics its a good card that still need time for review and Tests
and Buy the card sold by AMAZON incase you need a refund this is for International customers"

My factory Overclocked Boost Clock is currently sitting at 2040 Mhz without any further overclocking. I have only run a few benchmarks and its preforming very well and the temps are always low even after hours of testing/gaming.

* Great performance

CONS:
* Inaccurate product description - says works with 6-pin PCIe power cable, but requires an 8-pin to ground sense-B

DETAILS:
The description says this works with a 6-pin connector, but it does not. The socket diagram is attached. If the green / pin 4 / sense B is not grounded, then this card will report ""PLEASE POWER DOWN PCIe POWER CABLE(S) FOR THIS GRAPHICS CARD""

My PSU has two 6-pin PCIe cables, but no 8-pin PCIe cables. This leaves ground 8 and sense 4 unconnected. This PSU will actually drive 150W per 6-pin (Graphics workstation class machine), and the 16x PCIe slot will push 75W by itself. It's not a matter of voltage drop under load. It's simply that the card does not detect that sense B is grounded.

There are adapter-dongles galore, and even wiring a temporary jumper would bypass this; however, I did not buy a jumper, since the card said it would work with a 6-pin connector. Other models from ZOTAC included the Y cable, but not this one. Came from Amazon (not a reseller), and the outer shipping box was still sealed from ZOTAC directly.

I did test the 2x6 to 1x8 jumper that came with the ZOTAC 1070 Super, and plugging in just one 6-pin connector, leaving the other open, worked fine. But, I need that cable for the card it came with in another system.

Because of the incorrect info, the inconvenience of it, and how easily they could have included the Y cable, I'm subtracing one star.

Aside from the power connectivity issue, the card is great. It's only 6GB VRAM, but considering the price of 8GB cards, this is a great buy. It's a huge upgrade over my 1050 Ti. Passmark puts it at 2.9x the performance. I put it at the difference between standard with stuttering at 30FPS, and Ultra 60FPS vsync still running cool. (OK, yes, I should probably uncap the speed now, but I got distracted.)"

I've become a fan of the Zotac brand based on my previous experience with their GTX 1070 Ti. Their RTX 2060 AMP version is great for those who don't want or know how to overclock their GPU, and just want it to run straight out of the box. Note that I pair this up with a Ryzen 1600 CPU, 16GGB 2400MHz DDR4 ram on a 1440p monitor. Performance is great when playing most triple AAA title shooters. I get between an avg of 70-80 fps on high settings (Battlefield 1 & Battlefield V). On older titles like Overwatch and Battlefield 4, you can expect up to 120 to 144 fps on high graphics. This is true for most older games (>100 fps range on high settings). On more newer titles, you can reach the gold standard of 60fps on maximum graphics for most games.

The size is pretty compact leaving me room for better cable management, and it's lighter in weight compared to other similar brand offerings. Cooling is avg of around 40-50 Celsius, but that's more to due to my environment where humidity is high. If you in an air conditioned room it would probably be a lot lower. The Firestorm software which you can downloaded to OC this isnt very good. You're better off with a third party software like MSI afterburner.

All in all, I am very satisfied with the quality of the graphics card at the price point as I save more money (around $50) compared to other brands. I will definitely be buying Zotac in the future and recommending it to others."

It worked okay for one month (HDMI out would not work, but DP did), but suddenly stopped in the middle of playing. I contacted Zotac support via web chat, and they walked me through procedures to troubleshoot the card, and then they suggested I request an RMA. I immediately requested an RMA. It took three days for Zotac to provide me with an RMA to return the card. I returned the card immediately, and provided Zotac with the tracking number. After being delivered via UPS 5 days later (shipment to CA), it took another few days for them to acknowledge the receipt of the package (it was delivered on Friday and I received notification Monday evening). The e-mail response I received says ""Please allow up to 30 days to fully process your RMA from this date forward"". So, we are looking at around 6 weeks that the PC will be down due to this faulty card. While this may be okay if you have lots of extra parts laying around, for most people, this is not acceptable."

I have it paired with a Ryzen 2700X and 16 gigs of ram and it can play the following games on max settings at a decently high frame rate: Apex, Ark, CS:GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, Halo MCC, The Division 2. I haven't had any issues with throttling, or any of the artifacts that was common with the first gen RTX cards (mine came with Micron memory). I haven't tried overclocking it, but I believe that this card could handle it, the dual-fan layout seems to handle thermals pretty well and it runs quiet. My only gripe is the super-bright white LED logo that I can't turn off or adjust the brightness for, even with the ZOTAC Firestorm software. Overall this graphics card can handle most if not all games I throw at it and it can easily push 144 fps to my 144Hz 1080p monitor.

It immediatly felt like quality when I pulled it out of the packaging. I was very satisifed with the amount of performance it can take. I play a lot of R6S, CSGO, MW and other FPS games and this RTX takes it like a champ. One downside though, when I received my code for my choice of Wolfenstein: Young Blood or Control, I wasn't given an options and it straight away gave my W: YB. I heard a lot of bad reviews on that game and I was planning on choosing Control. Its alright I guess but I never played any Wolfenstein games so I wasn't into the series anyways. Back to the graphics card, I hit over 100 frames on average medium to high settings on almost all games I play except for Minecraft (due to heavy shaders installed.) Overall, if your looking to purchase a graphics card for a new personal build, or looking to upgrade your current system, I highly recommend this card. It looks great, quiet fans, and really packs a punch into any games your looking to play. I am amazed at how my games look with this graphics card, especially with the new CoD: MW 2019. The ray tracing dips my frames into the 60-70 fps but it looks amazing for campaign. Multiplayer I turn ray tracing off and the graphics still look unbelievable and over 100 frames.

I shopped several hours over several websites and dozens of the newest video cards before I took a chance on this one.
I would like to direct this review to you consumers that are similar to me. I built my desktop pc from components 6 years ago in 2011. At the time it was a decent gaming machine. Its been a decent gaming machine in all the years since. Of primary interest to this review is that back then I splurged quite a bit of money to buy two GTX 465's each with 1GB of VRAM. I ran those video cards using SLI with good results. I'm a first person shooter fan and always have been. My experience has been that if you build a pc for gaming, everything else you do with your pc will fall into place.
That's all well and good, but as time passed and newer games were released, my frame rates dropped. I could compensate by turning the game's settings back, which is fine by me. Eye candy is nice, but frame rates are the difference between life and death when playing a bleeding edge shooter. The system served me well for many years and many shooters until I bought DOOM 4. DOOM 4 is a great game, but with my aging SLI video cards setup my frame rates were terrible, almost unplayable, even at the lowest of the low settings.
My second most important criteria for the new card I chose is that it had to have two DVI connectors, since I want to run two LCD monitors. Back in the day two DVI connectors were common on video cards, but that is not the case now. This ASUS card is a rarity in that it has two DVI connectors, plus an HDMI connector, plus whatever that other connector is.
My third criteria when shopping for a card is less aggravation and faster speed of installation. I'm older now, I don't want to break my bank, I've got a growing family and much less time to fight a pc upgrade. This ASUS video card nailed it. I removed my old GTX 465's, plugged in this new GTX 1050 Ti, started the computer, and within a tiny handful of minutes Windows 7 figured out what I needed and installed it. I followed that up with a quick NVIDIA update and now this beast of a computer and video card smoothly plays DOOM4 on ultra settings. The frame rates are over the top. The computer is quieter, the power consumption dropped considerably.
I'm happy"

Now you're not going to run new games on ultra settings @ 1080p and get 60+ FPS-- BUT I knew that going in... HOWEVER this card is a beast a on med/high settings especially when you consider that this GPU doesn't require a power source from the PSU as it pulls all its power from the mobo.

I fully intend to replace it with a 1070 or 1080 sometime in the near future, but for now I'm more than satisfied with what I payed for. Since buying it however, the price has gone up drastically, so I don't know if I can still recommend it. It may be worth going for a 1060, or waiting for the prices to drop again.

thank you so much :) this is the third try in the last 20 minutes
Your graphics card is not working?
yeah its been failing randomly but today half my screen isnt displaying. I took it out and put my old card in and everything displays
Thank you for confirming.
I am sorry to hear about the issue and will be happy to assist you further.
thats why I love ASUS :)
So you want RMA for a graphics card?
yeah
Understood.
I would then suggest to chat in again and select graphics card as the subject libne.
so I have to give this a fourth try?
Correct. Have you been selecting graphics card though?
If so let me know.
yeah.
Understood.
I do apologize for that. I am not sure why you are not getting graphics card.

Yes the video card from the year 2008 if I remember correctly. Anyway I knew even buying a budget card would be a massive improvement. After all the ATI 4850 only came out with 512MB of ram! Yes thats right MB not GB. Moving forward after looking online for a new video card I was sticker shocked. I guess something called bitcoin mining has made the demand for video cards crazy high right now. the Date is 4/5/2018 at the time I'm writing this. However I needed a video card and I didn't want to sell my soul for one. So after realizing the 1060 was just too much I settled for the 1050 ti over the 1050. The reason.... I wanted 4gb of ram.... not the 2gb that comes with non Ti version. I have been burned by not buying enough ram but never by buying too much. So I did a search and it seemed that the 1050 ti series seems to be higher in price over their MSRP due to this mining stuff going on. However this card seemed to be the best bang for the buck and I have heard of ASUS before since I have owned many of their motherboards and knew they made quality products. So with limited stock and the prices seeming to be going up every day I placed my order at the 216 price and a few days later it arrived. I installed the card with little issue and loved the fact I didn't have to use an external power cord for the video card like the ATI Radeon 4850 used. Amazing isn't it that a card with almost 4 times the ram and many many times the computing power over my old card didn't even need the amount of power my old 2008 4850 card needed. Good job Nvidia! Anyway now I can play (WOT) World of Tanks at over 100fps using almost the highest settings. The new maps in Patch 1.0 look amazing with this card. I plan on loading more games once I find my Steam password again. However I am pleased even though this is not a barn burner video card it plays many games perfectly fine even though you might not be able to play them at maximum video settings. I hope this holds out until the prices of video cards come down. its sad what is happening right now in the video card world! I just checked and the cheapest I can get this card seems to be 267 dollars. :( the price has just gone up that much in about 1 week. Anyway time will tell if this card holds up but I am fine with it even though a little piffed that I had to pay a higher price than they would be going for if this mining stuff wasn't going on.

1. CPU= Intel 6700k
2. Ram= 16GB DDR4
3. Storage= 3TB Seagate HardDrive

With that said, below is how i was able to run certain games.

Battlefield 1...
Resolution- 2560x1080 (21:9, ultra-wide resolution) medium textures and settings at 60fps

OR
Resolution- 2560x1080 (21:9, ultra-wide resolution) high textures and character models, but low settings at 60fps

This card is also the reason I love PC Gaming, cause its so versatile, from custom resolutions like 1280x540 (21:9 ultra-wide resolution that I played at with onboard graphics before this card) and there is always compromises that you can make settings wise to get the performance you want within your budget.

On a final note, if you have 50-60 dollars more on hand to spend and want a more powerful card, go with the GTX 1060 3GB card.

BUT, if this is your first PC Build, or don't have the funds for something like a GTX 1080ti, this will hold you over just fine. Just know that you wont be playing games at Ultra Settings with 60fps with this card, maybe 30 at Ultra, but that depends on the game and resolution.

Expect to play most games with Medium textures and settings with no resolution bigger than 2560x1080 (21:9) or 2560x1440 (16:9)"

Using the DVI output, I could never successfully get video to interface with the SVGA Inout on the monitor despite trying several DVI to SVGA Cables and Adapters. Tried it straight DVI out to DVI in on another monitor and the video performance was crap using the drivers on the Disk that came with the card. Even downloading the latest from Nvidia was bad. When I tried running the Performance Rating Tests built into Windows, the PC would lock up about half way through the tests. Never really figured out why.
Then I tried various HDMI adapters to go from HDMI out on the card to SVGA Input on the monitor. Never got any video to work.
I reaaaaalllly wanted to use the SVGA input on the monitor, but it was not to be.
So then I went HDMI out to one of the HDMI inputs on the monitor. Video came up, but the displayed desktop was going off screen in all directions (despite the monitor using 1920x1080 and windows desktop resolution set to same). Using the Nvidia software, I could shrink or ""zoom-out"" so that the video fit, but it looked really poor and performance was trash as well. Tried drivers downloaded from Asus itself, but they seemed to be the same as the Nvidia ones and didn't change anything.
I went to Best Buy to return one of the adapters I bought and decided to exchange it for a longer HDMI cable which I might need later for a replacement card. So I bought a 6 footer and it was made by Insignia, the same brand as my monitor. Decided to test it out on the video card before giving it up and HOLY COW. Everything displayed perfectly.
I'm not sure why. The shorter HDMI cable I had tried it with still works good on my Apple TV and Raspberry Pi's so it wasn't bad. But the new cable did the trick.

The card maxed out on the Windows Performance tests. Works freakin awesome at every game I have from the original Unreal Tournament to Call Of Duty, Stalker - Shadow of Chernobyl, CS Go, FEAR, Battlefield 2, etc. I opened about 10 or more simultaneous videos in VLC windows at the same time and not a stutter. So I am keeping it. Definitely worth every penny I paid.

After installing the new update the card has worked flawlessly ever since. It would crash every 20 hours or so before but now it has not crashed once. Hopefully the update removed the problems my card was experiencing and I can trust it while doing photoshop projects. Originally a one star rating, I would have gone lower if I could have, I bumped the star rating up to four stars.

It plays GTAV on the higher-ish end settings just fine at 60 FPS, but with certain atmospheric games heavy on filters and whatnot like Dying Light, you might have to ramp down to Medium. Even so, it's fantastic and there will be those caveats with any card.

So if you don't need a 250 watt video card with 3 RGB fans, you might consider this 4Gig card. As to ASUS, my last 3 builds were with ASUS MB's, and I have laptops and peripherals of the same brand. My first build was an S-100 buss 8080A ""homebrew"" back in the 70's .. so I guess I get a little ""grumpy"" with all the wasted power these days. My PSU is a Seasonic 350 watt fan-less ..

The install instructions were straight forward, and I was able to hook up straight away to my two monitors. (There are three monitor ports on the card, each a different type.) I was up and running within thirty minutes.

I am not a video game junkie. I am a pilot wanting to work on my flying skills when not flying the airplane. There is tweaking that can be done I am sure that would enhance performance. After tweaking the X Plane software, the program runs smoothly and without the problems I was having prior to the installation.

The lighted logo on the card was red and pulsated which I thought it meant is wasn't working properly -- but you can select different colors and set it to static or 'breathing' or to pulsate with your music. The other question was that the fans didn't spin. This also something you can control Auto is set to start fans at 55c or you can set it to start at any temp (I changed it to 32c).

Well, a 1050 Ti is a graphics card that is used in a computer. The graphics card helps to increase the number of frames per second and the processing speed of a game. Frames per second, also known as FPS, is a measure of how many images, or frames, appear on a display every second. This frame rate is especially important if you want a clear and responsive gaming experience without screen tearing. For a computer gamer, an extremely good graphics card is necessary to play games at higher resolutions, such as 1440p or 4K. At the top of the consumer gaming charts for graphics cards is the Asus GeForce 2080 Ti followed by the more affordable 1080 Ti. The 1080 Ti, however, still starts at $500 new, which can break the bank for some. That is where the 1050 Ti comes in. At a starting price of $170 the 1050 Ti is largely more affordable without sacrificing performance. This performance to price point is the main reason that the 1050 Ti is a great deal.
The 1050 Ti is by no means equal to the $500 11G 1080Ti which can easily run games at 4K. For the people looking for a good graphics on a budget and who only needs to game at 1080p with very reliable 60 frames in most games. This can be completed with the 4 gigabytes of GDDR5, a special type of memory for video cards. The 1050 Ti is a good graphics card for those who do not play games every day yet want a good experience when they do decide to game. For that task, this graphics card is one of the best. According to the Asus website the 1050 Ti is overclocked to 1506 MHz from the factory. If you decide to buy the graphics card you will be able to see that the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) can be boosted to 1642 MHz which increases the rate at which frames are generated. The Memory clock can also be boosted from 7008 MHz to 8409 MHz. Boosting the memory clock speeds up the memory speed and volume at which it can process frames. This GPU contains 768 CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) cores. These CUDA cores are used to run an application programming interface that allows developers to focus the cores on certain parts of processing. As compared to the 1050, a slightly less expensive and the previous year’s graphics card, the 1050 Ti beat the 1050 in the same game by an average of 20 frames in Crysis 3 at 1080p using the same complimenting hardware and the same settings. This increase in the frame rate is due to the new NVIDIA Pascal architecture, which allows the graphics card to take less power and maximize the frames per second and the new DirectCU II, a cooling system using wing blade fans minimizing the sound output to almost 0 decibels.
Overall, this graphics card is a welcome upgrade over last year’s model and is priced at the same $170. Compared to most other competitors, the 1050 Ti, triumphs in dollars to frames at a very cheap $2.35 per frame losing to the pricier 1080 Ti at $2.32 per frame. This performance to price point is one of the best at this time making it a bargain for starting computer gamers."

Runs PUBG at ultra settings @ 1080/60 just fine. Now that it's out of early access, it runs at 2.5k/60 great. It should work great for all games for the next few years, unless you are going for higher resolutions such as 2.5 or 4k.

The only issue with this card is that it targets 85c, but the fan speed scaling is not aggressive enough. Because of this, some games will run the GPU up to about 93c, and then the card will throttle back or crashes with games/OS start occurring.

You can adjust the fan curves in the Gigabyte apps, but I found that custom curves would often FAIL to update the fan speed at times when the driver took over, causing the card to overheat, as the fan speed wouldn't be properly adjusted. It was possible to set the RPM to 100%, and then it would not crash, but then the fan is crazy loud.

The solution was to install MSI Afterburner, which allows a more aggressive fan speed curve to be set up, and you can then check the ""force fan speed update on each period"" option. This forces the fan to work properly. With the fan set to 100% at around 70c, the card no longer crashes, and peaks around 72-73c."

Update: I got it back from gigabyte RMA; they couldn't find a failure. I plugged it in, and it doesn't work as a USB hub, or provide video output. The Squaretrade warranty has also been useless; they only point me to the manufacturer. The fan makes a loud noise indicating failure (See Video). Gigabyte customer support is a nightmare to navigate with multiple logins created for the help ticket, and RMA process.

After installing the Windows 10 64 bit drivers, my HP Envy x360 couldn't detect it on the USB-C port. Windows 10 pop up requested me to check the cable and the device compatibility. My Macbook Pro could detect the device. I downloaded and installed the Nvidia web drivers, as well as the CUDA drivers. But, CUDA indicated that there were no GPU devices available. No where does it say that Macbook Pro is supported on the supplied documentation, neither does Gigabyte provide any drivers for Mac on the website. I did read else where that Mac is supported but perhaps they meant via Bootcamp.

I think it's a great product but I just didn't do enough research for the Mac, and not really sure what's going on with Windows. I've a support ticket open with Gigabyte, and I will update this post accordingly.

Update 07/22/2017: Got confirmation from Nvidia that drivers that the Web drivers should work. Did some more research and came across this script that is no longer supported: automate-eGPU.sh . It requires that you turn off rootless system integrity protection in Mac OS. This can be enabled after the installation is complete.. Attached is a screenshot of MBP system information showing the Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 video card enabled. It's working great!

Update 08/02/2017: I was wrong about being able to re-enable rootless system integrity protection after installation of the Nvidia drivers. If it is re-enabled later then the MacBook Pro does not 'see' the eGPU. CUDA preferences indicate 'No GPU detected'. :("

The box had a large rip, the cables where everywhere and with ripped plastic bags stuffed in the cardboard box.I assume the last owner was very impatient and just started tearing into the box in a bid to get everything out as fast as possible.

I didn't return it though since the actual eGPU looked to be in relatively new condition. The previous owner probably only used it for a little bit. I assumed this because when I turned it one it made this horrible whining noise that I assume came from one of the fans (only moving parts). Taking this into consideration I presume that the previous owner returned it cause of the noise. Maybe he thought it was broken or something. I open it up and saw that one of the tiny fans was making a god awful amount of noise. Luckily for me I bought two Noctua fans to replace the tiny fans that came with this GPU.

I did research on this product and learned that the tiny fans that come with it were pretty noisy (really low quality fans). Therefore I bought some Noctua fan replacements. These fans are easy to replace since the fan kits come with some splice connectors. Just cut the wires that connects to the old fans and splice it using the included splice connector with the new noctua fans. I also bought a 6.6ft active TB3 cable so that I can put my GPU out of the way.

My laptop didn't have thunderbolt enabled but it did support it. Had to do a bios update then install the TB3 drivers. After that I connected the eGPU and everything worked. The computer would say that it doesn't support eGPU and/or not all functions supported but it's completely wrong. Everything in the gaming box worked perfectly. Just ignore the warning messages. This eGPU is WAY BETTER than my internal gtx 970m.

WHO SHOULD GET THIS?
get it < GTX 1060 (Any computer than has less than a GTX 1060 in performance)

I've done testing and its only slightly faster than a desktop OC edition GTX 1060.

Fantastic 1440p/144hz performance on a 7700k with 16GB of RAM and no overclocking.,"It has been about 7 months since I purchased this, so I feel like I can give a decent review.

I like this card.

Pros: Fast, easy to install, not terribly loud, good controls over fan and lights in the software, good overlocking software

Cons: Computer has failed to boot on more than one occasion with visual artifacts on the screen right after POST. I re-seated the card and the powe connectors and it seems to have fixed the issue, but I'm not sure if this will be a recurring problem. The other issue is the coil whine. Maybe it's just the nature of the beast, but the occasional whine gets a little annoying sometimes.

I play on a 144hz monitor and a machine with a 7700k and 16GB of DDR4. Real-life performance at 1440p (2560x1440) with no OC:

Overwatch: Ultra settings with only minor things turned down. No super sampling (100% scale): 120-135 fps even on the most demanding maps and busy battles.

Battlefield 1: Second-highest settings results in consistent 90fps with few dips.

CSGO: Everything completely maxed out yields about 280fps.

I can't imagine that I will need to buy a GTX 1080 or GTX 1080Ti for another year or two, once 4K/144hz monitors become popular and cheap."

It installed without any issues. Another reviewer complained of coil whine/noise. I haven't experienced any noise problems with this card as of this review. My case is tight so a 9 inch plus card was out of the question. My previous card was a GeForce 660 so this thing tramples it in performance and I particularly like the H.264/H.265 video encoding feature for screen capture/live streaming.

The card is approximately 6.7"" in length and requires just one 8 pin power supply cable. Luckily my power supply has a 6+2 pin so no adapter was required. A cable is NOT included with the card. They also don't include an NVidia sticker either. The only big negative I can think of is that the card is tall and covers up my other PCIe slot. But hey, that's my fault for buying a computer with a small case, right? I can live with it.

Us computer geeks love statistics, right? My 3DMark Sky Diver 1.0 score was 29,605 which puts it in the 90th percentile of all tested cards. The Fire Strike 1.1 benchmark was 13,302 with a 83rd percentile mark. Considering my previous card was over five years old, I am very happy with these numbers! Ironically, most of the games I play aren't very demanding but I can tell you this. I played the For Honor beta and everything ran great. One day, I will take full advantage of this thing with a VR headset but not any time soon.

A tip for newbies: You do NOT need a Mini ITX computer to install this card. It's a standard PCIe connector. Also, upgrade your RAM! Add another 8 GB to make up for the resources that this card will take up. Otherwise, you may find your system slowing down. 16 GB of RAM total is my recommendation."

One of them operates perfectly... The other, did well for about one year until the card started to overheat. I brought it into a computer repair store to fix the issue and about a year later it started to sketch out and overheat again. Gigabyte's customer service team referred us to their site to request an RMA... They don't actually help customers... After a fair amount of pain and anguish, we were given an acknowledgement and returned the card... packed good enough to survive interstellar flight.
Weeks later we get a message that the warranty was voided with pictures of our card after Gigabyte dropped it.
There is no way I'd bother to send an obviously broken card in on a warranty claim... See the attached picture of what a video card looks like after a 2m drop test...
Overall the card works well when it actually works, and when it doesn't; good luck trying to return it."

The TB3 link on my lenovo 720P Laptop (with UHD Screen) is ""only"" x2, so just the 20GBPS limits me slightly. There are other reviews that prove it but essentially a full x4 link will give you slightly better frames but the CPU itself is more dependent.
In other words, if you're torn between a laptop with a much better cpu and a x2 TB3 link vs a much slower one and a x4 TB3 link, get the faster CPU, the link doesn't matter quite as much except for one critical thing with VR (and I don't think x4 would help it a great deal.)

This box has extra USBs including a charging port (a keyboard/mouse doesn't effect frames) and this is critical because you'll likely need them.

VR:
The GPU will work great with VR but you'll want to connect a monitor via DVI, the Occulus via HDMI, and disable the laptop screen. Otherwise the eGPU will think you want to re-direct video back to the laptop and cripple your performance. In theory an x4 TB3 link would work much better but it will hamper your performance anyway so don't bother.
In short: If you needed an eGPU for VR, you're going to want a 2nd monitor to the EGPU and disable your onboard screen.

The box is quiet, installs in a snap and doesn't need special software. The ""Aorus Engine"" app is meh, I don't use it and if the LEDs can be controlled I have no idea how. Those could theoretically be distracting but they're hidden in my setup behind my monitor anyway. You'll never hear it with headphones on, and even without, your laptop is probably louder.

As far as performance goes, with the i7-7700HQ and TB3 link I was getting 4k@60+ (""Mein Leiben"" settings) in Wolfenstein TNC. Not the newest game but it should give you a clue as to what to expect.

Based on all the research and reviews I did, I came to these conclusions:
1) CPU matters more than Link, ideally get something with a nice boost clock and 35-45Watt range, ideally NOT a 15 ""U"" processor (although this would work game well with it, miles better than integrated, you're tossing decent performance) at least not for VR.
2) Trying to use an eGPU on your internal monitor is probably not worth it, definitely not if you're only a x2 link on your TB3 port.
3) With a faster i7/i5 45W mobile CPU, you can expect about 20% performance drop from a DESKTOP version of the same graphics setup (native pcie x16 link) with TB3 x4 link (40GBp/s) and about a 25% performance drop with a TB3 x2 link (20GBp/s). Measurably slower, but hard to notice and works great, with my brandy new Occulus.

If money is no object, get the 1080, it will do a little better and is probably worth it, I went with this version as I got it from a Warehouse Deal under $500."

""It's just a plug and play?"" I thought. ""How difficult could it actually be?"" I would soon learn. Note that I've only had the Box for 1 day and I love it. However, some computers are less accepting of eGPUs than others. Setting up the Box on my Dell XPS 15 9560 took an hour and a half and involved 3 restarts, 1 BIOS change, 1 system update, and a driver download.

If you are using an XPS, the first plug-in attempt will result in the book telling you the card isn't supported. Try to connect again and the card will work.

After setting this card up it works beautifully. I can play all of my games on their most demanding settings. The Box handles my keyboard, mouse, and headset all without lag, as well as charges my phone and runs my 1440p monitor. Truly an amazing and useful product, just beware the setup, as it requires you not be afraid of warnings and persistent restarts.

That being said my gaming box arrived the most immaculate packaging I have ever seen. USPS could have thrown it of the back and it would have been fine. It comes with a very sexy and cushioned carrying case if you want to move it, as well as a short Thunderbolt 3 cable. I have ran every stress test I could find and all of the numbers were great in comparison having it directly connected via PCIE. It is very quit even when going at 100% capacity. It has some nice LED lights inside the chassis to let you know it's working. Although the lights are only on one side of the chassis so I have to have it facing one way which is slightly annoying but that's it. I gave it a 4 for easy to install because of drivers and such. As well 50% of the time things have to be done in a certain order for it to work. Laptop on (not plugged into eGPU) > Plug in eGPU (power only) > After 30 seconds or so then plug in Thunderbolt to Laptop > PLug display into eGPU.

All in all great product! I would recommend it!"

I've had problems with this card on-and-off since purchase. For the most part the problems didn't appear until 2-3 months down the line when I started playing more demanding games. The system plays games amazingly until a point where it crashes after 10 - 30 minutes under load. Up until the point of crashing it runs the game flawlessly. After replacing literally every component around the GPU, thinking it was older PC components, I found out it was the card itself! Imagine my surprise when, after lots of testing & planning, I found out this was the weak link! The Xtreme Gigabyte software that ships with the card has 3 modes. OC mode(Base 1620 MHz/ Boost 1822 MHz), Gaming Mode(default,1594 MHz/ Boost 1784 MHz/), Eco Mode(Base 1506 MHz/ Boost 1696 MHz). I found out after way too long and tons of forums searching that some users have to under clock their card to get it stable. I did so, using Eco mode(-89 MHz) and whoa! It provided a stable experience finally after months of this issue on an older i5 system and a new Ryzen 5 system. I have tried to follow up with Gigabyte on their RMA process, but it's a nightmare in and of itself. If you find yourself having this problem try underclocking the card from default for a more stable experience. It will play games well, just not as well if working as advertised. The RMA process with GB involves poor response times, single sentence responses and broken English among other treats. Save yourself the head ache and silicon lottery gamble and get another aftermarket 1070 with a good company behind it. I will not purchase another GB product after this one."

This card will eat up any new title maxed out on 1080p easily with 60+ FPS, usually a bit more. it's kind of overkill for 1080p gaming tbh but I got mine for $330 and could not be happier. They seem to be going for about $350 as of the time I'm writing this review but that can easily change. Overall the card quality is amazing, it doesn't feel flimsy besides the plastic case on the front that is over the fans but the actual card itself is built like a truck but that's not to say it is a bulky card because it's actually quite small compared to my giant 280x I'm so used to. This card does come with a nice black and white back plate and it really adds to look of it. This card does come with some RGB but it is minimal, if you are looking for a 1070 with some nice RGB, you should check out some of the Asus versions. Anyways, on the top of the card it says ""Gigabyte"" in whatever color you want using Gigabyte's Xtreme Gaming application. There is also some more minimal RGB next to it that says ""Fan Stop"". Basically fan stop is to conserve a little bit of power and minimize the noise coming from your case. You should not have to even use all 3 of the fans but even when it's around 70-80% fan speed the card is dead silent. That should be more than enough to keep it cool while gaming unless you live in a hot climate or have a rough case. My one nit pick on this card is that I really dislike the orange part on the front plastic because it really doesn't match my rig but the way my rig is set up I do not see it so I can't really complain!"

What it's not: a fool-proof solution, with reliable USB ports or easy integration with various laptops and OS. It has major firmware issues, and your mileage may vary. I love the design, HATE the LED lights, but thought that I could just turn them off. Many many hours later, I knew quite a bit more about eGPUs and I still couldn't control the lights or get all of the fans working reliably. When the fans were working they were annoyingly loud, owing to a poor choice in the specific 40mm case fans used; there are many people who have modded this case to improve the noise levels, simply replacing the stock with quieter fan models, but I didn't know this when I was ordering. I also never got the USB ports to work reliably; this has been fixed by a firmware update that sacrifices Thunderbolt through-put (read: performance) for more USB through-put; basically they messed up and didn't build a device that could handle the ports they gave it. I sent mine back."

I used it with my XPS 13 ...,"This thing is pretty rad! I used it with my XPS 13 (9360 v2, 8th-gen CPUs), which apparently only has 2 PCIe lanes to the TB3 port rather than the suggested 4, but it still worked like a charm for all the recent games I tested it with... maybe it took a hit to the framerate, but I didn't notice. I didn't notice any coil whine or excess fan noise, either. I also used it with a Windows Mixed Reality VR headset and that worked great, too; no lag, and everything looked really, really good.

I ultimately returned it, but not really because of the unit itself. I wanted to also use it as a TB3 dock (since it provides passthrough power), but the XPS 13 exhibits *significant* interference on USB when it's charging via the USB-C port. I have an external sound card, and it was just a mess of static regardless of whether I plugged it into the AORUS or directly into the laptop. If I powered the XPS 13 through its dedicated power port, the problem went away. I think I also experienced this with the Dell TB3 dock last year, so it's definitely the laptop rather than the AORUS. (Group your poop, Dell).

tl;dr version: this box is a great, affordable solution for decent gaming. It may not satisfy hardcore gamers who spend more time looking at their framerate counter than playing the actual game, but it handled everything I threw at it (HITMAN and Rise of Tomb Raider at 1440p) and seemed like a bargain compared to other eGPU solutions."

My normal configuration is four 2560x1440 displays (and it took difficulty and extra expense to get this card even that far). But I was hoping for a card that supports 5 or 6 such displays, because I'd like to be able to temporarily connect one or two extras for certain activities.
My son talked me out of a less expensive card with 6 DP connectors and 6x2560x1440 support promised, because that card was based on an obsolete chip set. Likely that would have been a better choice (but I still don't know).
I have 2 displays that fully support DP daisy chaining, plus 2 that can be either last or alone, but not first. When I got the card, I had short enough DP cables that they only reached by daisy chaining one pair, putting the 3rd alone on a DP and the 4th on HDMI. That worked beautifully when I added the monitors while already logged into Win10. But either rebooting or resuming from sleep with the 2nd display on gave no display and only recoverable by killing power to everything then turning on all but the 2nd display, then logging in before turning on display 2. Lots of experimentation and tweaks got me to the point that only the HDMI display (4) was lost (until next full power cycle reboot) if I made the mistake of resuming with display 2 on. Still not usable.
So I bought a longer DP cable so I could have two DP daisy chains and no HDMI. A lot of experimentation got that to almost but not quite usable. So I also got a longer HDMI cable, to get to each display on its own cable (like normal people would). That got rid of most of the resume from sleep malfunctions and by then I had learned enough about the relevant registry entries to get rid of the rest of the resume from sleep issues with some registry kludges.
Clearly this hardware supports 7 different positions for connecting displays despite having only 4 connectors. But the driver is too filled with bugs regarding any DP daisy chaining. Something (maybe driver, maybe chipset) also is more fundamentally limited to a total of 5 at once. Adding and removing connections while logged in showed it can see/identify all 7 at once, but will only display on 5 at once. Even 5 is not practical for normal use. It only works when you bring in the 5th while logged in. You can neither log in nor resume from sleep if the 5th is already there.
Lots more annoying, but not show stopping, problems are still there in the basically usable 4 display config I have after buying two extra cables I hadn't expected to need.
All of those seem to be driver bugs. A few of them are discussed online as being Windows 10 bugs. But using similar Nvidia based multi display systems, I never saw those bugs before, so I expect that online info is wrong and they are all Radeon driver bugs."

Playing Fortnite and rocket league is even worse, it freezes during competitive games and right when you are about to win. It is not another issue like too much thermal paste, because it comes pre applied. it cant be my CPU because when doing online school or watching hi-definition videos, my screen or computer doesn't freeze. it isn't my monitor because if not I would still here background audio. the frozen screens come strictly from the Radeon Graphics card.

I've been putting it through the ringer since then and I believe I'm now ready to share how this card stacks up compared to other aftermarket 1080s. My use was with stock settings, with exception of a custom fan profile.

I'll start with the bad.

-Cooling setup is lacking compared to the competetion's setups. There are two major reasons for this:

1. Smaller card means less surface area to dissipate heat. This means fans will need to work harder to pick up the slack and thus make for a much more audible card in comparison to something like an MSI frozr setup. (Though, not as loud as a reference card) Even while idle, fans will be at least 30% speed due to the second reason.

2. There is a revving issue which is present in many if not all of Zotac's AMP/Mini series. The fans cannot maintain a consistent speed bellow 30-35%, they will rev back and forth between varying speeds in a short burst of time. Thankfully, the default fan profile has the fans running above 30% while idle, so you don't necessarily need to make a custom profile.

-No RGB, just a white Zotac LED logo. May clash with your existing case lighting.

That's pretty much it for the bad. Now the good.

- While lacking, the cooling setup IS adequate if you don't mind a little noise. The card sits at about 30c idle, but I've never seen it go past 70c while under load even for an extended period of time (about 5 hours). It usually sits at about 66c.

- Performance has been on par with most other full sized 1080s. I'm getting 1870MHz out of the box, without overclock. Memory is 5005MHz. Though, this may be more luck of the draw.

-Decent overclocking potential. Good amount of headroom in terms of power and temps to apply an overclock given you get an OK piece of silicon. Does particularly well with undervolting as well.

-Very power efficient. Uses one 8-pin power connection. A 500w psu is plenty enough for this card.

All in all, it completely outdoes reference-style cards and trades blows with full-sized aftermarket 1080s even if it lacks all the bells and whistles they have. If you don't care for a quiter fan stop setup and need/don't mind something with a smaller form factor, this is a good choice.

(Edit 11/28/2018): I ran some benchmarks to get a more accurate determination of clock speeds and added memory speeds as well."

The mini card is perfect for anyone with a mini ITX build. If you know anything about video cards you know about what kind of performance you are going to get from a GTX 1080 chipset. As a quick baseline for you, with a core i5-8600k, and this card I am easily running Fortnite on EPIC settings no problems. FPS are around 100-144 (I bet it will max at higher but I have it set to stop at 144). If you knock a couple of the GPU intensive settings down it will lock at 144 FPS no problem.

I have read reviews that this card can be loud. Unless your case is on your desk, directly next to your head, you will barely hear it. And if you are hearing it, why aren't your speakers on?! Pretty much any ambient noise is louder than this card."

This card has it all-- powerful, great graphics, small form factor (great for my mini-itx build), powered only by 8 pin connection, hardware and software work flawlessly. So much better than the RX 580. And better than the 1070 card. This is like a having a real professional card vs. the toys (graphic cards) i had before.

I rma'd and got a dud that crashes games.,"For example, I've purchased both this and the GTX 1060 from EVGA and I must say, that card was definitely of better quality. Their GTX 1060 runs quiet and only turns the fan on AS NEEDED, basically during actual or serious gaming but this card basically runs FULL THROTTLE 24/7 never turns down. I""ve heard you can mod it to customize it or some nonsense but that sort of thing should have been handled on its own without me having to mess with any of that or flash a bios etc. The other thing is that this card seems a little , under powered? It just seems like it does maybe equal to or definitely less then other gtx 1080's in the same class. Not bad but not great. Finally the thing that really ruins everything was that after less than a year this card has begun to make THE LOUDEST COIL WHINE EVER when I play or run a game. It's really distracting and just a testament to the poor build quality on this unit and perhaps a symptom of very poor fan control since it's either full on 24/7. Really bummed me out so much that I wish i'd picked another company or at the very least perhaps a different variant because this one just doesn't make me happy. I literally LOVED my gtx 1060 compared to this GTX 1080mini. The only plus would have been the price, this appeared to have a good value for the price but that is right out the door if it's making this much noise playing any game i start."

I was disappointed to see that I was getting constant BSODs after booting with the riser cable recently installed. Couldn't even load the desktop in some cases.
I set the primary PCI-E lane to use x16 Gen 3 (PCI-E 3.0) and sure enough it booted just fine after that. So even though the packaging material says it's ""4.0 Ready"" it is sadly not. My BIOS was set to use ""AUTO"" as the PCI-E Generation spec, so it was likely defaulting to 4.0 and crashing on boot.

I decided to give the Extreme Gaming edition riser cable a try even though it only comes in 30CM at the minimum, but hopefully it will function at PCI-E 4.0 standards. I will update this review once I know if the ""Extreme Gaming"" version of these riser cables will work for PCI-E 4.0

UPDATE: I got the 30cm (Right Angle) Extreme Gaming version of the cable and while, yes, I am able to boot up with PCI-E 4.0 mode enabled (BIOS set to ""AUTO"") I got fairly frequent Blue Screens of Death with ""Video TDR Failure (atikmpag.sys)"" crashes. I decided to just run the PCI-E_x16_1 lane in my BIOS at 3.0 to prevent the crashes, but it just seems like these LINKUP available riser cables won't work for my motherboard + GPU combo.

The cables work well, and seem to be well made, and I don't have issues running at PCI-E 3.0 but they are certainly not guaranteed to work with PCI-E 4.0 in any and all scenarios.

**UPDATE**
I was notified about an updated riser cable from LINKUP called the ""Ultra PCIe 4.0"" Riser Cable and quickly ordered a 20cm right angle version of the new cable directly from LINKUP to give it a try, and to my delight it's working great with PCIe 4.0 x16 so far! I ran several benchmarks (3DMark PCI Express Feature Test, Time Spy, Fire Strike, etc.) and tests and have gamed quite a bit with it installed and my PCIe lane set back to ""auto"" and haven't seen any issues or BSODs so far using this new Ultra PCIe 4.0 riser cable. I've confirmed with GPU-Z that the PCIe mode is entering 4.0 while gaming or a video rendering load is detected. LINKUP will launch their true PCIe 4.0 riser cables in March, 2020 on Amazon.

Also the holes pitch on the PCB for the female socket was about 0.5cm wider than the mounting channel that comes with the Thermaltake P90 case. Had to drill a new hole to be able to mount."

Open Item Product and Terrible Packaging,"I purchased this item because of how long the Asus Strix 1080 GTX was. Unfortunately I did not have enough room in my H500M case with this card and a EKWB Xres140 D5 water pump. I have tried the EZDIY Riser cable and had no luck, TWICE! Although they did have excellent customer support.
Once I receive this riser cable I was expecting it to not work at all. The cable was bent in half, there was more than enough space to place the cable properly straight inside the packaging.The plastic packaging was already opened. I'm not sure if I received a cable that was returned before to Amazon.
Once I installed the riser cable to my surprise it worked fine. My pc boot properly and was able to play games without any random crashes.
Although hopefully the cable doesn't give me any problems anytime soon.
Paying $40 for an already tampered cable and terrible packaging is not good at all.

UPDATE:

Thank you very much to LINKUP for their excellent customer service. They informed me that Amazon in some cases sends open items back to another customer buying the exact item. Theres no need to give this company anything less than 5 stars. Besides the new cable they shipped me in exchange for the open one worked perfectly fine."

You'll need a separate bracket if your case doesn't naturally accommodate it. No issues with the cable, but I would recommend researching the the clearence between the side panel and your GPU before committing to a vertical orientation. Air flow can get restricted and things get hot quickly under load."

You can get the 220mm version which I tried and it is impossible to fold it enough to get it to work. The pci slot is only about 50mm away from the included vertical mount. After doing some searching I found this riser and it actually has a hole pattern that matches the included mounting bracket. Unfortunately even though you can attach it the gpu(or PCI Express device) doesn't line up quite right with the rear mounting bracket. I had to drill a new hole and thread a new screw with a spacer into the plastic bracket that comes with the Phanteks case but it was realtively easily overall. I am incredibly frustrated with Phanteks for a number of reasons which started with the fact you can't buy the riser needed that they even have in their manuals and have in their website. Luckily this one worked with a small modification."

Products (10 cm and 20 cm) arrived exactly as described. First impression is the cables and connectors are made of good quality materials. Especially these twinaxial wires are very flexible to bent and twist. Nice to have in my very tight gaming case. I have done some initial test with my Asus GTX-1080Ti GPU card. It performs almost the same with or without these riser cables. Surprisingly, I left the machine to run 3D benchmark test for hours and noted that the performance remained the same. I think the twinaxisal wires do not build up heat as easily as other brands of cables that were made of flat ribbon material covered with foil or ducking tapes which the benchmark result drops when heat built up. Great cable. Thanks. I will definitely purchase a longer length (maybe your 5ft/150cm extreme riser cable) for my next wall-mounted gaming PC."

I will plug it in to my GPU, and my motherboard... Turn the PC on, and have all sorts of issues. The moment that I remove this cable, the PC is running perfectly. some of the things that happen is that the display will cut in and out randomly, there will be a bunch of artifacts all over the place, I can't open my start menu or restart the PC, the audio is crackling, literally so many things happen with this riser cable. I would like to say that it was just the cable I received, but this is the second one that I've had and they both did the same thing. So just beware, if you purchase a riser cable, and you experience those things, it's the cable and not your PC. It's very unfortunate because these cables make the PC look so much more badass. But looks don't count for much when your PC isn't running."

Unlike the Thermaltake version, this one works really well and is much less expensive than the ""premium"" cable Thermaltake wants you to buy to replace their POS standard cable. The bolt pattern is perfect for mounting in every Thermaltake case where vertical mounting is an intended feature. I used mine on a Core P5 build. The length is a little too long, but the resulting loop that goes under the GPU mount bar helps hide the other cables that get routed to the bottom of the motherboard from the hole in the GPU tray just above the PSU."

im running Asus x570 TUF Motherboard, Ryzen 3800x and Asus 5700xt. The only reason i bought this was to vertically mount video card to because it blocked chipset fan.

 I ordered the Premium Straight 20cm for my Asus TUF GT501 case and Asus ROG Strix 1080 Ti 11GB gpu. I did contact LINKUP support as I wasn't %100 sure which riser to get. Before support contacted me back I had already ordered the Premium Straight 20cm. Support wasn't too sure which riser would work as they have not had testing done with my particular case. I can confirm that the Premium Straight 20cm does work with my case and gpu with no additional hardware. Took a matter of 5 minutes to get everything in and up and running. LINKUP support is awesome as they kept in contact with me up until I received and installed the riser. I did update them about the riser being compatible with the Asus TUF GT501 case."

Hands down.,I couldn't be happier with this product. It works as advertised. Using it to relocate my second video card in my Nvidia Sli 1080Ti rig. My 1st card was reaching 84 degrees and would begin to throttle down. Now with the relocation it doesn't go pass 64 degrees. I have not lost any performance by using this PCI-E 16X extender. I congratulate this company in making such a fine product.

This cable was more than enough length I needed to install it to the motherboard, but it was a tight fit based on my case.

Installation took me about 7 minutes, and it may be a little bit more if you're working with an ITX system depending on your case. You can bend the cables back and forth and they will not break. One of the cables is more flimsy than the other, but this is part of the design, not a sign of reduced quality.

I also did some comparisons with the GPU performance directly to the motherboard and using the card. With PassTime9, connecting to the motherboard yields a score of 15411. Connecting with the adapter gives me a score of 15,319. The results are about a 0.6% drop for my configuration, but it's a very small performance drop if you need to use this cable.

It's a rather expensive cable. There are less expensive cables that can perform the same function, but you do get what you pay for. If you buy a cheaper cable, you may see a higher performance drop compared to this. I thought this product could have been a little cheaper, but I am not disappointed with the results."

The cable was really high quality, especially considering it's about half the price of the ""premium"" branded stuff. It was thick and seemed well shielded but had plenty of flex so it could be tucked away unnoticeably. The split ribbon style made it easy to rotate the connector axially too if that's something you need to do.

Only one I've tried so far that is true to the word flexible. I fit this in a 10L case with an ""S"" curve in a 3 cm gap between the backs of the GPU and motherboard. Works like a charm.

I found many that I liked better than this one that had RGB LEDs and mounted to the expansion slots in the back of case, but due to the way my case was designed (Cougar Panzer), they just wouldn't work. I settled on this one, but I'm happy with my purchase. It's a no-nonsense brace that has a magnetic base with 2 adjustable supports (if you need more than one) and a 2-part post that can be taken apart if it doesn't need to be as tall for your application. My case has dark tempered glass side panels, so I chose the black one. It blends in very well. It took a little bit of effort to find the optimal placement so that the support arm wouldn't interfere with the fan blades on the GPU, but that's to be expected. I think it was worth the money."

Pros
The adjustable padded ""hand"" can be moved very low or very high. Giving amazing non-sag performance

Whole thing is made out of Aluminum making the bracket very strong

A magnet at the very bottom keep the bracket in place for very little movement

Looks very nice. mainly only for people who don't want RGB in their PC as this bracket has no RGB.

An extra rod and ""hand"" for full tower cases.

Cons
For my case, there was very little space to put the bracket but just enough to have it's balance.

Almost nothing bad about this bracket and it's amazing for almost everything. Although for me I would not use it for my full FGB component PC as it doesn't match my PC but I really think it would look good on yours.

Really recommend!!"

It's minimalist and looks fantastic in my case.

Bought it for my Sapphire nitro+ 5700XT, which is a huge card. Holds it up nice and level.
Since I only had 1 card, I didn't need to use the whole support, keeping the insides looking and open.

When installing, I recommend to first flip the case on its side so that there is no video card sag. Then put the brace under the video card and adjust the support to just be touching the video card. This way, you don't put any upwards pressure on the video card. The magnet at the base of the support is also great for staying in place when the case is flipped or moving around."

31.0,ZOTAC GeForce GT 710 2GB DDR3 PCI-E2.0 DL-DVI VGA HDMI Passive Cooled Single Slot Low Profile Graphics Card (ZT-71302-20L),Zotac,Nvidia,1600 MHz,2 GB,$49.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,Set your expectations properly and you'll be pleased,"The last time my dad came out to visit, he brought a massive ATX tower desktop. Knowing his requirements (and looking inside at how empty the case was), it was clear that this was way too much case and way too little PC. We went and picked up a salvaged Dell Optiplex 755 small form factor PC, then I cleaned it up and added more RAM and a hybrid hard drive. There was one problem left: the Core 2 Duo's internal graphics were hilariously awful, struggling to push 1080p playback at all. It was obvious that he needed a graphics card, just about any graphics card, to make it usable.

The case is slim, only about 4"" side to side, and there's no PCIe riser, so I was limited to half-width cards. he didn't need much, nor did he want to spend much, so this card was the lucky winner.

This was my first adventure into Zotac graphics cards. I've heard mixed reviews on their higher end stuff, but this was a good opportunity to step in and see how their lowest end stuff performs. I *do* want to feel them out before deciding on a GTX 1070 model for myself, after all. The GT 710 was more than enough for my dad's needs, the low-profile form factor was great, and the passive cooling made it completely silent.

1080p playback was flawless. YouTube looked and sounded great with no stutter or distortion, and local media files played just fine. The card runs a bit hot, but that's to be expected from a passively cooled GPU in a compact case.

...that didn't stop me from trying to overclock it, though. Because I was already pushing the limits of what this cheap OEM power supply could handle, not to mention the thermal limits of the card, I didn't go too crazy. I did get a nice little +60MHz core, +200MHz memory bump. Because I was perfectly stable there and hit only my thermal limits, the card probably has some more headroom for a better overclock in a bigger case with more ventilation.

That said, under no circumstances would I consider a GT 710, let alone one powered by DDR3, if I were shopping for a gaming rig. The card just isn't designed for that, and even low settings at 720p will offer choppy framerates and bad graphics quality. To put it into perspective, I still have a GTX 260 from my old PC lying around. That GTX 260 can run rings around the GT 710. The 260 is from 2009. The GT 710 is from 2015. Consider that if you're thinking about using this card for gaming, no matter how light.

That said, no one really markets the 710 as a gaming card. It's marketed for what it is: a card to add HDMI support to a PC that doesn't have a built-in HDMI port, or for old computers that need a cheap replacement for outdated untenable graphics that can't keep up. If you keep that in mind, temper your expectations and understand that you're just not going to get a brand new, high end gaming card (or any worthwhile gaming card, for that matter) for $40, you'll be very happy with this purchase."
31.0,ZOTAC GeForce GT 710 2GB DDR3 PCI-E2.0 DL-DVI VGA HDMI Passive Cooled Single Slot Low Profile Graphics Card (ZT-71302-20L),Zotac,Nvidia,1600 MHz,2 GB,$49.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,works great if you don't have a full sized 16X PCIe slot available.,"I was trying to set up an old PC with UBUNTU Linux to use as a home theater PC. The PC didn't have room for a bigger graphics card requiring a full sized PCIe slot. While this graphics card will not satisfy a PC gamer wanting a really fast GPU, it is working great for me for 1080i HD videos. The old PC I was trying to use had an integrated VGA port on the motherboard, but it was too slow for watching HD video. I don't know if it would be enough GPU horsepower for Ultra-4K video, but it is great for 1080i.

It has a good sized heatsink without a fan, and it only requires 1 slot width of space. I would not suggest putting it next to another adapter card where air couldn't flow easily over the heatsink. I had already put a quiet case fan to exhaust heat from the CPU and its fan, and everything is staying cool without having noisy fan(s) on the graphics card. In addition to wanting the system to be quiet when watching TV or listening to music using the system, it is in my bedroom where I wanted it quiet when not in use.

Other reviewers said they have difficulty using the card with Windows, but I'm using it with UBUNTU without any problems. It runs fine with the open source drivers as well as with NVIDIA's latest drivers for UBUNTU 18.04. For people that cannot get it to work as a replacement for their systems' motherboard built-in graphics, it may help to disable the onboard graphics in CMOS setup or via jumper setting on their motherboard. The onboard graphics are often AMD-ATI-Radeon or Intel. The Windows drivers for this card using an NVIDIA GPU, sometimes don't work well when trying to have multiple display adapters active that are not the same brand.

The speed versus cost of this card compared to others isn't really great, because you're paying a slight premium for a specialty card, since this is the only one I found online that works in a tiny 1X PCIe slot."
31.0,ZOTAC GeForce GT 710 2GB DDR3 PCI-E2.0 DL-DVI VGA HDMI Passive Cooled Single Slot Low Profile Graphics Card (ZT-71302-20L),Zotac,Nvidia,1600 MHz,2 GB,$49.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,Great budget upgrade for older integrated video. Not really for games though.,"I don't really use this card for games, but it's not really meant for gaming anyway. Sure it can play some games on low or basic HW accelerated web games, but that's about it.

Now, that's not to say the card doesn't have its advantages. It absolutely does. I was looking to upgrade the integrated video on a 6 year old system that serves primarily media duties. The integrated video could only hardware accelerate x264 video streams, but only up to 720p and absolutely no 60fps video, regardless of SD or HD. Well, this card absolutely cured that. Full x264 (AVC) hardware acceleration, hybrid (CPU+GPU) x265 (HEVC 8-bit only, 10-bit not supported on this card) acceleration, plus MPEG-2, VC-1, WMV3, and VP9 with full HW accelerarion.

Now I can play 720p video at 60fps and all of the above codecs at 1080p at 24/30fps with no problem. 1080p/60 was dropping quite a few frames, though. But I overclocked the card's base clock from 954MHz to 1200MHz and it plays it perfectly now. I know that seems like a big increase in speed for a passively cooled card, but the temp barely breaks 50C with 1080p/60 in a 78F room. The card has a temp limit of 80C, so I'm not worried.

All in all, it's doing exactly what I need and doing it well."

But avoid if you can.,"This card, for what it is, is a godsend. If you really cannot avoid fitting a graphics card into a x1 slot, this is the one.

That said, I had a few issues with it. On the computer I actually bought it to use with, it was problematic in either of the two x1 slots on the board. It worked ok in one of the longer slots, but being only x1 was noticeably slower than an otherwise identical card running at x4. I wasn't running games, just VMWare Workstation with full screen VMs on a secondary monitor.

The takeaway is that even low end GPUs can benefit from a few more PCIe lanes. This card is the right choice if you really only have an x1 slot, but if you have a few more lanes to spare (I can think of at least one Geforce 710 card with an x8 connector) you'll be better off, even for general desktop use. x4 seems to be the sweet spot for GPUs of this caliber."

Using it on a cheap Ryzen/FreeBSD system for bios and console access.

The included low-profile brackets are only usable if placed side-by-side due to the VGA ribbon cable length. If you need to hop over an expansion slot like I did, you'll need a different VGA bracket; one that places the VGA port on the opposite end of the expansion slot. I used an MSI GT 710 bracket I had lying around.

Also, be aware that the DVI port is DVI-D and not DVI-I. I have a bucket of DVI-to-VGA adapters but they were all DVI-I; not compatible with DVI-D. This would have been a deal breaker for me if not for the spare low-profile VGA bracket."

I don't play games so that wasn't a consideration, but I watch a lot of video and noticed a lot of frame drops with 1080p material using integrated graphics. This particular PC runs Ubuntu 14.04, displaying on a recent-ish Samsung LCD TV via HDMI.

This Zotac card fits in a single PCIe x16 slot, even with the passive heatsink. The install process was simple and less hassle than I thought, since my BIOS defaults to using any PCIe card as the primary display. Had to download & install the proprietary nVidia GPU drivers but this literally required 2 clicks after opening the Additional Drivers program.

I use the opening few minutes of my Quadrophenia BD as a graphics test because playing the beachscape in VLC used to look like
paint melting off a wall. It looks fine now.

Graphics aren't perfect as I see tearing and some judder in VLC, but none of that is apparent playing the same content in Kodi. I saw a
few frame drops with the Two Towers 1080p but these were minuscule compared to frame drops under integrated video.

Bonus surprise: the nVidia drivers added a bunch of new GPU data to my pSensors screen, I didn't even have to do anything, they just
showed up. So I'm able to track GPU temp, activity, bus use, etc..

Despite being installed right next to another card, GPU temp always falls after I stop video and it never gets too hot even during a 90 min 1080p movie. So the passive cooling is sufficient for my use.

One glitch: using the nVidia driver's default settings, dark scenes were almost unwatchable. The screen went mostly blank as black rendering was way off between this card and my LCD display. Fixed this by limiting RGB color range in the nvidia-settings program, now dark scenes look fine."

I needed this to run additional displays. I run 3 Monitors off my main GTX 760 and 2 more off this Zotac GT 710.
Mashed potatoes n Gravy, could not be happier with the results. It plays 1080P videos on my Plasma at 40C temp and only uses 167Mb of ram of the 1 gig. really don't need the 2 Gig for display use. 1 GB is over kill.
In terms of heat produced, and performance for the task at hand the thing hits hard, I mean it just works and keeps on working.

Simple set up even a small child or older adult can do it. The thing practically installs itself.
No fan is needed, no extra power connector is needed. Uses the same Nvidia drivers as my main card.
For most activities its GPU is at 135Hz and memory is at 400hz (throttled down as not needed) And this is running full 1080P videos.
Perfect card to add additional displays to your system.

I'm gaming on one monitor and this little card is pumping out FULL 1080P video to my 65 inch TV all at the same time without even breaking a sweat. For the price I'm not sure how you could ask for anything more."

I do not do gaming, so couldn't comment on that aspect. My Dell Inspiron desktop has only one expansion slot, and that is a PCI Express slot, which is a short slot. Higher end video cards require a lot more connections than will fit into an express slot. What is weird, is that I called Dell tech support to get them to recommend a video card. After getting a recommendation from them, I checked out the card specs and discovered that it is not an express card and would not fit in my motherboard slot. I kept looking and finally found this card on Amazon. I ordered it, put it in my computer, and it has worked wonders ever since. I am happy with it. It was also easy to set up using the information provided with the card. There is one caution: the card has outputs for VGA (15 pin), HDMI, and DVI - one connection each. It will only drive three monitors if your monitors will support at least one of the supplied outputs. Fortunately, I had a monitor that would support DVI, one that would support HDMI, and one that would support VGA. I think there are some adapters on the market that will change some output connections to a different configuration, however that costs more money. I was able to support all 3 of my monitors with the single card with no problems. I mainly run word processing, spreadsheets, email, and low end graphic programs."

31.0,ZOTAC GeForce GT 710 2GB DDR3 PCI-E2.0 DL-DVI VGA HDMI Passive Cooled Single Slot Low Profile Graphics Card (ZT-71302-20L),Zotac,Nvidia,1600 MHz,2 GB,$49.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,"Good feel, can be used in a lot of different form factors, and can play modded Minecraft","The first thing I'll say about this card is that it feels nice, it doesn't feel like a cheap video adapter. It comes with two individual half-height brackets, one for the DVI & HDMI, one for the VGA, which means you can split them or rearrange if needed. Also, the VGA ribbon cable is detachable, so if you need a single slot, half height card with only 2 ports, that's an option.

No fault to Zotac, you can only fit so much cooling in a small space while being passive, but the card does run rather warm. It sat at about 55 C while running 2 1080p monitors, and that's with the stock paste replaced with Noctua NT-H1, but I didn't have a whole lot of airflow in my case. Blasting a fan directly on it dropped it to the 40s. If the thermals mean something to you, I would recommend an active fan version.

I bought this card as an experiment: AMD cards perform terribly in OpenGL (Minecraft uses this), so I was wondering how my R9 380X would compare to this. The (quite sad, actually) result was that in vanilla, my the R9 got higher FPS, but in modded, the 710 would beat it at least 2x, up to 6x (not a very scientific test, but that was the out of the box experience), which meant that some packs that were previously unplayable are now playable thanks to this card."

I never shut down my systems except for maintenance, so when I decided to add a video card to my Xeon server, I didn't want to introduce extra noise. I didn't need anything really powerful since it was a server and I would have just lived with the onboard GPU but there are some games nowadays that insist that your graphics card meet certain video requirements just to run a game server. Maybe it's just programmer laziness since servers don't really display game graphics, but as they say ""It is what it is"". The Zotac GeForce GT710 fit the bill at its low prices and fanless design. I have Zotac in my gaming system also, a 6GB 980Ti AMP Extreme that has three fans, yet they only run when needed so idle noise is very little. Add this to an Intel i7-2600k running a fanless heatsink, a fanless power supply, and no mechanical drives, and even my gaming system is quiet.

Sadly, I cannot vouch for how good the GT710 runs games and other graphical applications because I do not need this on a server. If your only intent is browsing the Internet or playing some older games that do not need State-of-the-Art graphics, this card should work fine. If you want to play the latest Battlefield, Call of Duty, War Thunder, etc., look at another card."

Installed QUICKLY and no CD needed! WIN 10 PRO 64.,"INSTALLED in a DELL OPTIPLEX 910 / WIN10 64 PRO with NO CD required. Others complained about the 1/2 card plate? My provided plate installed quickly and without a hitch. I DID willingly give up the ""VGA"" 1/2 plate but that's fine because my DELL already had VGA output and this OPTIPLEX has only 2 half-height slots.

While WIN10 did install this card quickly (without a CD), I DID go to the Control Panel to 'update' the drivers that were 'auto-installed' for my ZOTAC Card. I'm not sure what good that did because the display results was already more than acceptable.

This card now drives a VIZIO 43"" Monitor; the pixels and display provides ""VERY good"" quality results via HDMI (B+)! While I can not judge this card for gaming, for GENERAL USE and my applications I am more than pleased... and honestly, my results are better than I expected!

Other notes: I did spin the provided CD up, but it wants/tries to install MANY more bells and whistles (read more hard drive space) that I did not want or need. A simple WIN10 online 'driver update' gave me just what I needed.

I read other reviews about 'sudden black screens' and a few other complaints, but 'MY' card has no issues like that and is simply ""OUTSTANDING"" for my needs. Perhaps the 'update' fixed that black screen problem before I saw it?

The bottom line is, ""for the money"" ~ This ZOTAC has my vote! Sure one can spend a LOT more money for other cards with lots more memory and such ~ but please don't overlook this spiffy ZOTEC Video Card! Mine was purchased here on Amazon 'used', but please don't tell my Dell!

1. I don't play games, so I couldn't rate the product on something I haven't experienced.
2. I didn't have to contact the tech support, so I have no idea how they respond to anyone requiring assistance.
3. The problem with my Dell 64bit system was related to the processor not being able to accept the Windows 10 operating system.
4. However, the video card was exactly what my limited computer system required. Indeed, the video card has enabled me to utilize this old computer system with two different SSD operating systems (Windows XP & Windows 7 Ultimate). My 16X PCIe slot was being used by a USB-C card because I transfer a lot of videos out of the system, so the 1X PCIe slot will suffice.

Runs cool (35-40C) with adequate case ventilation. Good price. SINGLE SLOT AND SILENT OPERATION! Perfect card for general 2D applications / multi-monitor productivity expansions.

My story:
I wanted to free up one of my dual PCIe x8 slots on my motherboard to run it in x16 mode for my primary graphics card (GTX 1060). I initially had an older GTX 760 which is a large card, takes up two slots and inhibits air flow to my primary card, on top of the blower cooler generating a bit of noise and preventing x16 mode on my main card.

Now I have this card which drives my spare monitors which I use for web browsing, twitch streaming, YouTube, monitoring temps & GPU / CPU loads, network traffic, general purpose 2D stuff etc. It had to be single slot to fit at the bottom of my Mobo otherwise it would interfere with the PSU, and to keep my other x8 slot free. This card nailed all the requirements perfectly, plus already using Nvidea drivers, it was effectively plug and play. Windows automatically registered the new card and one reboot later everything went back to normal on my three displays."

Amazon they were very helpful but since the 30 day return window had passed the connected me to Zotac. It took about a week of haggling with Zotac to get an RMA. Meantime a bought an MSI board which also worked fine and still does. Finally got the RMA and delivered the board to Zotac. After about 10 days the said there was nothing wrong. We haggled some more and then I got a message that a “replacement” board was being shipped. It arrived Oct 16, 2 months after the problem began. What I got was a board, in an anti-static bag, in a USPS flat rate box.

I can’t tell if it’s the one I sent them or of it’s actually a replacement. I think a replacement would have consisted of a completely new package with the box, manual, etc. so I’m inclined to think that they just sent my old, defective one back.

I’m certainly not going to waste any time testing it. It’s just money down the drain as far as I’m concerned. For what it’s worth, I wouldn’t count on Zotac’s “warranty” if you buy one of these and have a provlem."

It did degrade gracefully to PCIe v1 eight lanes.

Running Elementary Linux 5.0 ""Juno"", this worked OK with the default open source driver but was noticeably better when the AppCenter was used to install the closed source drivers. Installation was very smooth. The nVidia driver does reduce clock automatically to cut down on GPU heat when not loaded.

Temps- idles at 40C. When bumping the GPU utilization to 72% with an OpenGL based screensaver, temps went to 70C. At no time did it throttle back or outright fail because of excessive heat. Since there is no fan to speed up on a heavy load, it will heat up, but the heat sink has proven adequate, although not great.

Does work with Steam, if you are not too ambitious. It is an entry level board!

This does not work with VirtualBox VMs and accelerated video (Linux host and guests). For that, lay off nVidia and get an AMD Radeon board; you will like the fact that AMD supports open source development while nVidia remains hostile to same."

 Adquiri esta tarjeta ya que buscaba algo de potencia para el 1080p sin gastar mucho estaba decidido por una RTX o una GTX pero están sumamente inflados los precios en mi país estas tarjetas así que me decidí investigar y probando una RTX 2060 de un amigo, la RX 5600XT me resulta mas potente, la diferencia entre la 2060 y esta es que la 2060 tiene ray traicing y el codec nvenc para streaming pero si eres como yo que no te interesa el ray traicing y no haces streaming esta esta perfecta para ti.

Cabe decir que esta versión es la que tiene la BIOS ya actualizada que hace que libere todo su potencial así que ya no tendrás que hacer nada mas que instalarla y listo, funciona de maravilla

la temperatura que tengo es de 35 a 37 en reposo teniendo 2 monitores conectados y 1 televisor, viendo películas o vídeo la temperatura es igual, en juegos la he probado con juegos como Red dead redemtion 2 y la temperatura no sube a mas de 64 grados en settings altos con una tasa de 50 a 65 fps y en GTAV no pasa de 60 grados en ultras con una tasa de 60 a 80 fps, los fps se limitan por mi procesador el cual le hace cuello de botella a mi tarjeta pero lo actualizare en breve.

My setup is quite recent (AMD 3900x / Gigabyte B550I / Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB), and running latest windows 10 pro. Before this card arriving, I have my old XFX RX460 in it, fairly stable and smooth except for gaming.

After upgrading to the new card (this 5600XT), I see couple crashes from Raedon software, I'd guess is due to the previous configuration is not match new card, no big deal. So far the card is recognized as ""Microsoft Basic Display"", and the performance is poor as I can see lags when I drag a window. Though I would expect win10 will recognize the 50-serie and install drivers automatically, I am okay with extra manual steps.

Nightmare comes after I installed latest drivers from AMD.com:
1. First couple boots are okay, but soon blue screen shown after I login and try to move the mouse. I reboot but it repeats.
2. The next several boots either just fail with blue screen (some TDR failures which seems related to driver), or stuck in a weird state where nothing shown on the screen. The graphic card's LED is on, typing keyboard does not response, so I have no idea.
3. After several hard boots, I finally get into safe mode, reinstall the driver, and selected the ""factory reset"" option which says will clean previous driver setup/configs, but I still see constant blue screens.
4. Repeating #3, but this time I used AMD's cleanup utility to remove the drivers first, which requires reboot but occasionally crashes on next reboot.
...

I spent 15mins to put the card in, but 4 solid hours to try get drivers installed yet failed. I referred to couple solutions suggested in the other 1-star comments, but didn't work for me. I'd say this is the worst way to waste my weekend time.

I tried a bit more today but still the same. Going to return this and get a 2060 super which is $100+, but after this mess, the cost-efficiency is not the top of my mind. Hopefully, the N-card will be easy to deal with.

Update on 8/22/2020:
For comparison:
Just got Nvidia RTX 2060 Super founder edition. Put it in, boot into windows without any issue, and windows update found driver for it and installed automatically (not even require a reboot), and not a single crash noticed after an hour use so far.
There is no hardware or software change on my box, so I can conclude the issue is AMD unique."

I recently upgraded to a 4k monitor with HDR and wanted to take more advantage of that extra visual capability. This card will help with that. Depending on your system and the software you are trying to play you can easily get stable 1440p resolution. Low end games are no problem at 4k resolution. As an example I was playing Doom Eternal at 1440p with stable FPS above 60 even during heavy action.

If you are really wanting to play everything in 4k this card might not quite get you there. As a 1440p card though you cannot beat this price point. I highly recommend for this level.

The HDR on the card is ok. This I don't fault as much with the card as the software trying to use it. You can get HDR video and gaming but each game handles it differently and Windows itself is different. The biggest thing I can say here is that you can defiantly do HDR with this card as long as your monitor and all the other setting are set up accordingly."

After I was done, the case itself is ok, but using an ati 5700XT (which barely fits), the case just does not have the capability to dissipate heat efficiently. It's literally like an oven. I had several freezes and hangups during gaming and I had to hard-reset my PC, which I haven't had to do in a very long time. The freezes stopped, when I removed the side glass panel, the freezes and glitches stopped. Obviously it's not cooling well, even though I have 4 fans (2 intake, 2 exhaust) running. Also to be noted, that one lonely USB port by the power button also doesn't work. I had disconnection issue with my phone. Connects/disconnects. I checked if it was plugged in correctly in the motherboard and everything is fine. The USB port is useless. I'm outside the window to return this case, but just an advice, buy this case if you have a budget PC and you aren't planning to run a $400 video card and if you aren't bothered by fan noise and you are more into aesthetics than functionality."

I first thought it was drivers and uninstalled everything with DDU and previous Nvidia drivers/registry/ect just to make sure. Nothing worked only for 1 moment I was able to play minecraft and Tetris for a good 30 mins before closing everything and freezing on the desktop out of no where. Never display an error log windows how no idea what happened.

When it did work temps were solid never reaching over 60 C on load which was nice. As counted about 30 mins of great performance.

I uninstalled all the amd drivers and all issues disappeared. Though I didn't try to play anything it never froze on the desktop. I bought this knowing amd had drivers issues but I needed an upgrade. What I didn't know is the issues were so bad they would freeze my pc. Doing nothing on desktop resulted in some hard restarts to continue investigating.

Sorry red team I went back to the green team with an old gpu and no issues occurred from then on.

Underrated.,"I got the 5500xt 8GB model. I’ll start by saying that I originally bought this just as a “cheap” place holder for my new build until Big Navi was released. The reviews on it aren’t great but most of them just complain that the price is too high. I can kind of agree with this because the next step up is the 5600XT at $100 or less extra and the performance from the 5500 to the 5600 is night and day. But that’s not to say the 5500xt isn’t a good GPU. It got my 1080p gaming done at over 60FPS in most titles on max or near max settings. This is definitely a 1080p card. But it can perform somewhat at 1440p if you’re willing to tinker with some settings.

Over all I think this is a decent buy for anyone looking for a very good and cheap 1080p experience. Anything above 1080p and you’ll want to move up to the 5600xt or 2060 depending on if you’re an AMD or Nvidia person respectively.

I got this card for $200 new and that’s probably the max I would spend on a 5500xt 8GB. Anything higher and you may as well move up to the 5600xt.

Also, I’ve had two AMD cards since August (5500xt and 5600xt) and I’ve never had any driver issues at all. So either I got lucky or AMD got their driver problems resolved. I’ll stick with AMD over Nvidia as long as AMD makes cards that give me the level of performance I’m looking for."

- Noise

As you see, under ""no load"" the fans shut down, the only hum you hear is the stock case fans. Even at full bore, I can't hear anything, and my machine is a foot and a half from my head! It's a silent killer.

- Performance

Paired with my last gen Ryzen 5 2600x my machine still scored a %96 on user benchmark... Unfortunately, I don't have a monitor that can keep up with the card yet, so it's cutting the FPS, but at ultra settings, I am getting 110FPS in Borderlands WITHOUT Overclocking!

Overall

This is hands down, the best card you can get for the dollar. The RX 5700 XT is ranked 15th, but the performance to dollar amount is not worth the extra doll-hairs you will spend going past.

It only happens when I launch a game. I have an Nvidia card as well and this does not happen (keep in mind I'm not using the gpu to stream just X264 an force gpu render disabled). I even reformatted the whole pc and started fresh and still happens is ridiculous.

Also the AMD GPU has a lot of issues.
1. it wont let me change the bitrate from 8 to 10 for my monitor (my nvidia card did)

2. it wont let me create a custom hz profile for my monitor which is compatible with 75hz (my nvidia card did)

3. If a custom profile is created good luck trying to remove it. It gets glitched where it says you need to change a different os resolution to be able to delete it and when you do still says is active when is not.

4. The video bitrate on mine got stuck on 6 and everytime I changed it to 8 and checked windows said 6 and the radeon software would change it back to 6. (I fixed this after reformat)

I uninstalled the software, downgraded it, clean installed it and still was buggy as hell. Worst experience I have ever had with a GPU so I believe the higher price for RTX might be actually worth it."

To begin, even my post slowed down using this card. I literally saw my screen draw at times. Yes, you read that correct. I saw lines of my screen drawn one small block at a time like I was working with a computer in the 80s. I speak from experience as I built computer in the 80s. LOL

Now onto the drivers and the black screen that is common. I couldn’t get any of the AMD supplied drivers to work with this card. Old to latest drivers would result in a black screen and crappy startup experience. I had to use DDU tools in safe mode multiple times to get to even a 30fps state in the OS.

I'm a computer tech by trade so its not normally an issue to sort some upgrade issues out, they happen even with NVIDIA. This time I have tried every trick I have learned in 20 years to find its beyond the normal upgrade issues I have experienced in the past. AMD needs to fix this issue period. You shouldn't have to be an engineer to upgrade a simple video card. Install the new card update the driver mess with a couple of setting and be on your way.

While their complaints weren't invalid at the time, its AMD's fault that the drivers were bad, NOT XFX. The only thing XFX could be blamed for was the quality of the card. As a result, I believe that the early reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.

With that being said, it being September, the drivers work just fine now. Installing it and getting to work was a breeze, the card is amazing for 1080p and it does 1440p with some tweaks here and there.

While I didn't stress test the card for more than a few hours I didn't find any issues with it overclocked running on the latest drivers, easily hitting 200 fps in esports titles such as CSGO/fortnite and 100 fps in more demanding titles (at 1080P).

This card is quiet and is fast, if you're looking for a high refresh rate 1080p or 60hz 1440p gaming this will do the trick. If you want a solid card in the 250-300 range keep this one on your radar.

This card met and exceeded my expectations in every category.

The performance is great for a $200 card, it has been able to handle every game I’ve thrown at it on 1080p with a mixture of high and ultra settings no problem. The biggest surprise for me though was just how quiet this card is! Even under 100% load the fan is so quiet that I can’t even hear it.

Overall an excellent budget card for 1080p and multiple monitors that I would recommend to anyone. I know that some people (and myself temporarily) were put off of this card after looking at the benchmarks, where it only fared marginally better than the 580/590, but when it comes down to it the lower power consumption is 110% worth it. These cards can also overclock very hard (think 2.1 Ghz) if you’re so inclined.

If you have been unable to find a 1660s any where for a reasonable price you can safely purchase this card in a heartbeat, and not be disappointed. I am actually glad that I wasn’t able to find one, and got this 5500xt instead."

 Apparently you don’t always get what you pay for and the Linkup PCIe 4.0 riser cable is a great example of that. I paid upwards of $70 for this thing and expected it would be good and essentially perform the one basic thing that it’s designed for without dropping frames. In my experience, a high price point usually indicates exceptional material and quality assurance. In this case, it absolutely did not.

I read some of the bad reviews and should have listened, but I figured they were probably talking about the budget line of cables, not the premium one I was looking at. It’s hard to tell since they’re all grouped together on the same page. One more selling point was that my mobo has 2 PCIe 4.0 ports on it so I figured I’d go the future proof route and this item is sadly it right now if that’s what you’re trying to accomplish.

Immediately after connecting this thing to my RDX 2080 ti and plugging it into my Prime X570 Pro motherboard, I experienced boot issues and the fan on my graphics card ran constantly at full speed, then BIOS would try to load, the error light on the mobo indicated an issue with the graphics card, boot would fail, then the system would reload and repeat the cycle until a reset screen appeared from too many failed attempts. After the reset screen, I could get to Windows without making any actual changes in BIOS. Windows took significantly longer to load than normal and crashed sporadically while running. Every time I would reboot, I would have to do the same thing. I tried removing and reinserting the riser firmly. It doesn’t really lock in place on the motherboard (which felt cheap) so I thought maybe it wasn’t seated correctly. I tried reseating it and using multiple ports - nothing helped.

I have read some cables aren’t well shielded and thought maybe that was the source of the issue. To test this theory, I wrapped the entire cable in anti static shielding plastic four times over and from terminal to terminal - absolutely no change.

The second I took the riser cable out of the situation, everything went back to working flawlessly. I seriously hope this thing didn’t damage any of the components of my rig. I thought I could trust it because I paid enough to expect a good quality cable. Save yourself a few hours of wasted time and potential damage to your rig and look elsewhere. At least to me, it’s not worth the risk and this thing is getting returned first thing in the morning. Lesson learned: never buy a Linkup brand cable again."

However, it can absolutely hinder them.

That said, I saw zero framerate drop between cabled and my 2080 (non-ti version) plugged straight into the motherboard. I ran multiple benchmarks (3DMark, in-game, etc) with and without, and differences were within margin of error.

I did notice about a 4-6C drop, under load, in temps on the card, and about 2C drop on the CPU, due simply to the fact that the card was off and away from the motherboard. These temps are with the case side-door open (more on that below).

Cable seems very high quality, and was sufficiently long (actually just a bit TOO long) for a standard mid-tower case. Kind of wish there were color options other than just grey, as a vertically mounted GPU on a showcase PC is sexy, but kinda let down by the bland cable. I think CableMods exists because I'm not the only one who cares about aesthetics to the point of custom-coloring our ATX cables.

Sadly, the ASUS ROG Strix 2080 I bought is a 2.75 slot card, and is just too thick to mount vertically in my Corsair 500D case. It gives me about a 1/4inch gap if I close the case door, and then the temps just skyrocket. I used it instead in my old case with my old 980ti, which seems to get enough airflow; dropping temps by a few degrees even with the door closed.

Good product, despite me not checking if I could properly fit my GPU vertically. Hopefully one of you learns from my oversight."

I wish they would find a way to do a single cable or tubes versus flat though as long ribbon cables are notoriously a nightmare for cable management and them splitting this into multiple small ribbon cables makes it a mess.

Overall pick this one over if you're worried about electrical noise and shielding. Durability is great, I can see these lasting a while as well. This cable is futureproof too and should be able to handle new standards within the next 5-10 years easily."

Very thick but this is great if you need heavily shielded. I was able to twist these cables to get fit into a half height slot, and they worked fantastically (most cables did not). These babies are expensive, but well, well, well worth the price. No other cable that I twisted was able to fit through a half-height slot and continued to work. NO LOSS OF SIGNAL, and can be twisted any way you want! Best of both worlds. I literally spent $100 on cheap cables and after a while they resulted in a system halt due to PCIe signal fault. I had to throw them out. I am using a souped up 256GB 82TB RAID 6 SuperMicro Dual E5-2697 v2 48 cores. The case is only 2U and thus only has half height slots. ALL OF THE OTHER CABLES REQUIRED TWSITING OR CRIMPING TO FIT IN THE 2U SLOT ON THE CASE! This is why they failed, If you see the pictures, these cable DO NOT use ribbon cables, these are individual wires that are shielded and divided. This way you can navigate these cables to fit into very tight spaces. MOREOVER, and this is the best part.... NO SIGNAL LOSS. Moreover they do not obstruct the adjacent PCIe lanes. If you look at the supermicro X9dri-ln4f MOBO you get alot of PCIe slots, but he space is very, very tight, especially in a 2u case. Yeah they aren't cheap, but you better believe they are worth every damn penny, especially if you had to go through wasting the time, energy, money and suffering the frustrations all the other cables caused me."

The box the 1080 Ti came in was in perfect condition and the card itself looked brand new. I've been using this card for almost a month now and have had zero issues with it.

To be fair, I did have software issues first, but I resolved them over time and then tried another brand new card to test out the rest of my system and that worked great. When these cards work, they're fantastic.

The support team from this re-seller was fantastic... they had great advice, all of which I had to go through just to clear the software trouble, and they fully refunded the purchase and offered to send another card.

It does not have RTX but who care really, when you can play most modern games at 1080p in ultra detail, or in 4K at high or ultra.

It does heat up quite a lot, and noise level is pretty considerable, but overall it is still bearable if your case is a good case with decent insulation and good exhaust fans.

Not a single game is dropping below 60 fps in 4K, and with some games I get more than 100 fps on average; no stuttering, no issues whatsoever.

Save some money and get the previous gen; RTX is still new technology that is barely used in games, and in some new games like control, turning RTX on does drop about 10 frames per second, so there is still a lot to do to get real time rendering in games. In the meantime, this card will serve you well."

It also looked great in my system.
However, I immediately heard a noise when the fans kicked on. I tried to duplicate it off of the computer with no luck but I did notice, when mounted, the power wire to the fan would hang just enough for the blades to rub against it.
The bitter outweighed the sweet on this one. For as much as this card costs, it shouldn't make much noise if any at all since there are no bearings in the fans. The photos show the blades wearing through the insulation of the wire and the blades themselves being blasted down. Eventually leading to overheating or possibly a fire.
This little problem slipped by QA. Now I've been waiting a few days for the return to process, after it's been delivered. This I can't completely hold fault to them due to Covid.

I think it had something to do with BIOS. Installed it,, and my monitor would just be black, and the computer would beep, like it didn't complete POST.

Leave it to lenovo to put everything on the other side and upside down.
The fan isn't made to be run upside down and becomes noisy right away and make an awful sound.
I took it apart and tried to make the now lower bearing work, but there is no bearing, some oil lasted a day or two.
I replaced the fan with one that has dual bearings and it works better and keeps it a lot cooler, the stock fan sucks bigtime."

So I had to return the card.Though Supermicro states that it uses PCI 2.0x8 the actual slots are smaller that that, but are bigger than a PCI x1 slot more like maybe a PCI 2.0 x4 slot. The slot ends are closed too so no over length cards can fit. I wish manufacturers would include the size measurements of the PCI connection on the board, if it would have been there i would not have ordered it due to it not fitting my system."

I promptly installed it in a truly ancient computer, built in about 2001. I do not recall who built that machine and it is not labelled. It has a VIA motherboard and sports a 1.4 GHz Microsoft Pentium III-S Tualatin CPU. As best I know, this is a server chip and was the fastest Pentium III chip ever made. Of course, this is not saying much. The mobo was maxxed out at 1.5 GB of RAM and had a GeForce 5200 128 MB video card. The main problem with this computer lay in the grossly inadequate computing power of the CPU, and I was hoping that by unloading some tasks to a newer (but still pretty old) GPU that some degree of resurrection could be achieved. The GeForce 6200 was actually graphically wonderful, providing fast, sharp, nicely-colored still images and on-HDD movies. Sad to say, the CPU remained grossly under-powered for 2017. Even so, this machine does everything one could want except show streaming video, which makes it hang. It shows DVD's and on-HDD MP4's beautifully, streams music from my iPhone, handles Office programs, etc without problems."

If I went to YouTube or loaded up too many programs, the computer fan would kick off and things would get sluggish. It's only day one with the EVGA GeForce 6200, but the 512 MB really does make a difference (and you really can't do any better than 512 MB, from what I've seen, if you want to spruce up your old AGP computer). There are a few concerns, as I bought the card OEM from tangcao (can't beat $29.99 and included the video card and a drivers CD but no cords), and I have read about the capacitors (the bulby things) being cheaply made in this model, but everything is going well so far.

I did not sweep my drivers or uninstall the previous drivers and did come across two errors while installing the drivers and software. I took out the 5200 and put in the 6200, booted up in low resolution, installed the XP 32-bit version (includes XP 32, 64, and Vista 32, 64 drivers), ran into an error near the end of installation which, seemingly, won't be an issue in the future, then when I booted up there was an explorer error which, after I told explorer to end, also seemed to stop being an issue. Will update after I reboot if I have additional errors. These errors could be due to the fact I didn't uninstall old drivers, and if you are replacing an old card that isn't a GeForce I might suggest you get a sweeper.

This card goes up to 1280x1024 resolution, and everything looks great on my ViewSonic VA800 post auto adjustment. Also, there is a power slot on this card which does not seem to need to be connected to the power supply like a PCI-E card might. I don't expect to do much other than watch movies or browse the Internet on this computer, but I'll see how it goes. Feel free to ask any questions."

System is a 3.0 ghz Hyperthreading CPU, agp slotted, 2.5 gb of pc2700 ram, should have some pc3200 instead I guess, and video is not as unwatchable choppy as previous, when previous the onboard video was just not up to the task, but there is still some minor choppiness sometimes like the computer makes a click sound and suddenly there is chop, then it goes away for a little while. I feel my nine year old computer, bought in Feb 2004, it might not be as up to the taks for videos as my brand new AMD based gateway/acer, but it is actually pretty great, I believe some videos on youtube and hula, of vintage movies.
Mainly I'm using the old Dell Dimension 4600 as a backup computer, running win xp sp3, and also for those moments on discussion boards when someone posts ""check out this cool link to a video I saw posted somewhere"", I swear my new computer got attacked by malware twice right after I bought it and had to have advice on a different antivirus software to download, so internet security is a must for me.

If I figure out why the computer chops into the video on youtube sometimes, I will post the solution, could be that the computer is only registering 2.5 gig of ram even though I have 4gb of ram installed, I INSTALLED A FULL 4GB OF PC3200 400 MHZ 1 1gb ram sticks, four of them, it is still showing 2.5 gig of ram on the control panel page, but at setup when computer is starting up, the memory is shown to be installed at 4gb and what mhz its running at and dual channel, so computer is likely just having some sort of minor conflict with the card, board previously showed 3.75 gig ram, but hey, without the card, the computer would be totally unuseable for videos, and I have a new computer anyway, so oh well, maybe I'll figure it out."

However, no matter what I tried (and I spent several evenings on this) I could not get this 512M EVGA card to work in an FIC P4-486PE Pro running XP - there were driver ""resource conflicts"" and the card was left stuck in VGA mode. The resource conflict was in the memory map; for some reason the video card's 512M memory was always allocated in *addition* to the AGP driver's memory, and there just isn't enough available memory for that in XP (and I have 3G of RAM; it is more an issue of where the memory is allowed to be allocated to device drivers). For my previous (and subsequent) 256M 6200 the card's memory was allocated *within* the AGP driver's memory space and there were no conflicts. This memory is separate from the ""AGP aperture"" memory, by the way.

I have the (one and only) BIOS for the FIC P4-486PE Pro motherboard, the most recent Intel chipset drivers and I tried with various Nvidia drivers - some older ones, the ones from the CD and the most recent 270.61 version. I also let the BIOS re-pick the resources and off course I performed all operations from safe mode with full driver uninstalls and cleanups etc. prior to each attempt. I even tried with an Ubuntu Linux setup and although I did get to a non-VGA desktop it locked up right after that.

So I can't tell if this is an issue with my BIOS or with the card - but for sure they do not play together and it just did not work. When I replaced it with a new Gigabyte 256M 6200 everything worked just fine.

PS When you see a resource conflict with the ""vgasafe"" driver, whatever you do, *** don't *** disable that driver as that is the default VGA mode you get before your driver is installed."

The card recognized the AGP 1.0 slot and automatically chose 3.3v power and 2X speed. Installing was as easy as removing the old graphics driver, turning off, removing the old graphics card, installing this EVGA card, booting to W2K and installing the driver. I installed the ForceWare version 94.24 driver that I downloaded from Nvidia.

The order arrived in 3 days (Super Saver shipping). The card looks well made, and I like the absence of a fan. I don't know how much power it can draw relative to the ancient Matrox Millennium 2 it replaced. No problems so far for my 300 watt power supply, and the case temperature hasn't changed.

Image quality and font legibility are excellent with this card if you connect it to the monitor with a DVI cable and go with the monitor's native resolution and refresh rate. I chose driver settings that enhance image quality at the cost of a little speed. The card's speed makes no difference with productivity applications, but it makes Internet page loading faster while taking a load off of the CPU."

Funny thing is it seems to have gone up in price. I do not remember if I bought this as new or used at the time. It perfect for serfing the web but anything graphical wise may not work as the card specs cannot handle it that well.

I figured 4x the memory it should be fantastically fast, right? Wrong. Oh it installed easily enough... WindowsXP recognized it and got it going in seconds. Then I tried streaming some video from a network TV website, and as soon as I'd go full screen, the video and audio would go horribly out of sync. So I went to the EVGA website, got the newest drivers, did a ""clean"" install to be on the safe side... but no change. Just horribly lagging video behind the audio as soon as I'd go full screen.

Guess I'll have to try something else, 'cause this one is going back."

It is now a super low cost item and still works wonders for running older 3D games perfectly. We even got Gears of War PC (2007 graphic intensive game) to run on our old P4 2ghz with 2GB ram with this card. We had to tune back the graphics but it worked and was actually playable. This is saying something because outside of this video card the rest of the PC pretty much fails the basic minimum specs to run that game. The video card was doing all the work. Older games like Unreal 2 and all the Tournament versions, etc... they all run perfectly on this card and with the graphics options cranked up to max. Very pleased, this video card helped us get a couple more years out of that old PC which is still fully functional today."

But if you're like me and clinging on to old technology because it's often ""good enough"", then you may want to consider this card as an upgrade if you have an older, slower AGP-based graphics card in your old system. I upgraded from another Nvidia card with just 64 MB of memory and the difference is very noticeable even in casual web browsing and light graphics use.

This won't make modern games shine, more than likely, but if you're an active user of an older system with on board or a small graphics card, this might be a worthwhile upgrade for not much money.

At least on my system (AMD Athlon XP 2700 w/ Windows XP) it still won't smoothly play 720p or 1080i YouTube videos, but other more efficient file formats can be played in full screen HD at 1920x1080 through native players."

Wanted a temporary upgrade between computers. I didn't expect such an upgrade from my FX5200 128mb, but the difference was remarkable. I tried to play Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion on my FX5200 and I couldn't even squeeze 2-3 fps--even with Oldblivion-- but when I installed the 6200, I was playing the game almost without a hitch! After that, I messed around a little and maxed-out the graphical settings and resolution and could manage about 15 fps--in the starting tutorial part. After I got out into the open world I couldn't manage 10 fps, even with the graphics down. Nonetheless, this card is very impressive for the price. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a card in this price range!

Completely revived my old Dell Dimension 4600 32 bit system, that was having issues after upgrading to Linux Mint Rosa edition. Graphics, videos and task bar weren't performing well at all. Whole computer just seem overwhelmed by the Op. System upgrade. This GeForce 6200 transformed the Old Dell to a beautiful running machine. With the new Linux Mint 17.3 and this board, this Dell now runs as fast (actually faster) as my 64 bit laptop running Windows. Videos, and web pages are now opening at lightning speed. I don't game on it, so it fits the bill wonderfully for what I do and need. Studying, bill paying, record keeping home stuff and such.

to 512 mb's, got new card, got rid of failing fan all togeather with heatsink on new video card, DECENT PERFORMANCE!
They do make bigger more powerful cards but they are $300 to $800 for anything better, so for me at $44 it's
a real bargain, tough (nvidea chipsets), quiet because of no cooling fan (heat disapating - heat sink block),

The video card went out, and I quickly found out that AGP 8x cards are pretty hard to come by since hardware has changed drastically in the last few years. So I came across this video card - fairly inexpensive, decent specs, and AGP 8x to fit my motherboard. It gave me video again, but I can't say that it improved video performance at all. It actually may be causing some slight skipping when streaming video, but it could also be from a variety of other factors. All in all, I'd only recommend the card if you just want to replace a bad card and aren't going to expect performance of a high end video card."

Since the previous video card was dead, I had to put this card in to even be able to see anything, so I hadn't uninstalled the drivers for the old card, and hadn't installed the drivers for the new card yet. Nevertheless, I was able to boot up WinXP to a low-resolution screen. As I always do, I downloaded the latest drivers from the NVIDIA website instead of using the CD.

Ditched the CRT and bought a refurbed 24"" 1080P Toshiba, Best Buy $176. Wanted something to handle the resloution. This was a decent valued card for under $50. Had some trouble on install but was my fault not following instructions I think. First (1) Go to EVGA.com and download latest drivers (don't use CD). The 301.42 Drivers and Control Panel comes with optimization wizard and TV setups. (2) After that uninstall driver for old card in Device Manager. (3) Shutdown and replace card. (4) Start Up and Windows will find new hardware. Install new driver and all should be good. I had a couple of issues. First of all I didn't remove driver for the 5200 FX card. When the computer loaded windows the screen was mostly grey. Display setting was 800X640 4 Bit. Tried loading driver after the fact but CD drivers didn't work and or would not enable. Box came up saying not enough address space and would have to disable other hardware. Disabled Onboard video. Big mistake. Then had nothing. Had to keep hitting F8 to go back to last known working setup. Called EVGA help desk. BTW number on CD Manual doesn't work. Tech Support is 1-888-881-3842. Finally we changed the Bios setting to VGA from PCI and downloaded the newer drivers with the NVidia Control Panel. Everything is Good now. Also FYI I tried to set the display higher than 1360X768 but screen was unstable. Ran the Television set wizard and now it works in 1080 alot better. Hope this helps. Found alot of online forums with people having similar issues with installing this card. But I think if its done correctly it should install with no problems. I have a ABit IS7-E Motherboard with 2.4 Pentium. Replaced 1.5G Memory with 4G, $65. Everything seems to be running fine now. Hope it lasts a few more years."

I found the Amazon purchasing experience to be as expected. As far as the product performance I have found it to be of high quality so far but the thing I find to be the most satisfying is the continued software support for a piece of hardware that services an older machine to help it perform to a more up to date functionality. Also EVGA is very straight-forward that the future software support will be reclassified to legacy version after x-number in the support system. Another thing I like is that I have become aware that the NVIDIA web site is also a viable source of software, news, and a never ending stream of moral support. In summery, 3 month's into the initial install I am not only pleased with the product but I am also enjoying the upgraded software capabilities over and above that of what had existed before the upgrade to this older yet continually well functioning machine.

-1060 3gb vs 1060 6gb:
Do you know you have a definite need for the extra vram? if not then I would not recommend a 6gb over a 3gb. 6gb cards are significantly more expensive (~25%-50% more) and for most casual gaming applications you will only see about a 10% difference in performance.
-Dual fan vs single fan
Are you going to be regularly/significantly overclocking? If not then the single fan is plenty for you. I play battlefield 1 on medium-high for hours and this card has zero issues with cooling at all. When you're not playing games this card even runs so cool that it does not require the fan at all and goes into an ""idle"" mode where the fan does not spin to reduce noise. If you do plan on overclocking I would recommend looking into a dual fan card but if not it really isn't worth the money it won't make any significant difference.
-This vs rx580
I believe that this card slightly out performs the rx580. The rx580 beats it in a few areas such as texture detail however overall the 1060 has more areas where it outperforms. This combined with the efficiency of the 1060 is what made me choose it over the 580. Because of this efficiency the 1060 will both use less power and run cooler than a 580 all while being at the same price point. Single fan 580 cards are known to run pretty hot during normal gaming whereas this 1060 hasn't struggled in the cooling department at all in the time I've had it."

If you are as curious as I was to what the difference of single vs twin fan cards are, I found the simple answer browsing some PC build forums.

Basically, a lot of it boils down to looks, and the rest is how far you can overclock past stock.

-PC enthusiasts love beefy, expensive looking cards and equipment to fill out their towers, and twin cards deliver with their bigger case, lights, and backplate. Single fans don't have any of that, but are cheaper as a result.

-Single fan cards also don't stand up to overclocking as much as twin fans because of heat dissipation. That's not to say single fans aren't adequate out of the box. If you don't plan on overclocking, a single fan is just fine and will never overheat. Running at full power on max settings playing OW makes the GPU top out at 72C. If you'd like you can also alter the fan speed settings within the Bios to keep the GPU cooler or quieter.

You really don't need a twin fan model, or really anything above a 1060 if you're a basic gamer that doesn't care about looks and just wants a high performance card you don't plan on messing with. I'm playing on a 144mhz monitor and get 160FPS playing Overwatch on Ultra, and about 100 on Epic. TF2 is beyond easy to play at max and Subnautica looks absolutely beautiful on topped out graphics with no stuttering. My tower is in a somewhat confined space as well and the card has never overheated even in 5+ hours of non-stop gaming.

UPDATE: I downloaded the ""Precision X"" Bios from EVGA and updated the card. It's now faster then ever. Even on stock tune and no overclocking the card is now peaking at 2012mhz, WAY higher than advertised and higher than any stock clocked 1060 on the market. I'm loving this card more every day."

Save your dollars and first buy a new display, then move up to the GTX 1080 Ti, or next generation GeForce cards that ship later in in 2018.

The only change to any of the default settings on the hardware was to turn on the MSI motherboard's native Game Boost. After that, I installed Windows 10, and since I had no hiccups, I began installing games.

As a plus (because I'm a nostalgic gamer) I have even tested a PS2 emulator, and it's working just like my old Playstation 2 did. As I install more games, I will update my review.

So consider the card 3.5 stars and an additional half star for the quality of service behind the product.

==============================

I bought this card because Amazon wouldn't allow more than one per household on the MSI GTX 1060 AERO ITX model. This card is technically more powerful than that model, being ""superclocked"" and all. And I have to admit, it's a great card. However the enclosure and fan leaves something to be desired.

The fan on this card is much too aggressive. Apparently it initially had a max fan speed of 2600RPM but a BIOS update on later revisions bumped it to 3900RPM after some issues with the EVGA 1070 and 1080 models. This card isn't impacted but I guess it was a precautionary measure. But because of this, the card sounds like a jet engine once you get into the mid-50% speeds on the fan, and the stock fan curve is extremely aggressive, ramping up as high as 70%+ speed when the card is around 70c (when it can easily go up to 80c without any throttling or problems). This was a souce of confusion, since video reviews on the card note it's whisper quiet, but that was way back before the vBIOS was changed.

MSI Afterburner or similar software is a must for this card, not for overclocking, but for fan control. A custom fan curve goes a long way, and you can keep this card at around 75c or below at 100% load with a fan speed of about 52%, at least in my case (Corsair Carbide 100R Silent edition with two front intake 120mm fans and one rear exhause 120mm fan). I highly recommend installing MSI Afterburner or EVGA's own Precision X OC immediately after installing this card and setting your own fan curve. Doing so will turn this card from ""powerful but I don't want to use it"" to just ""powerful.""

So basically, I tentatively recommend this card. It's good, and a fantastic 1080p gaming card, and pretty decent even at 1440p. But without an aftermarket cooler or a custom fan curve it's really noisy.

=========================

Lastly, a note for Linux users:

Obviously you don't have access to tools like MSI Afterburner. That's cool though, you've got bash. I got some help online and came up with a script that controls this card's GPU (well, any Nvidia card) based on the temperature. You can find it at the link below:

https://pastebin.com/2iANCPEy

The script controls the fan by using an offset value to set the fan speed to an offset of the temperature. If the card is below 56c the fan will stay on at 12% speed which is essentially spinning but inaudible. Once it passes that temperature threshold, it sets the fans speed to the temperature plus the offset. In my case an offset of -22 worked well. That way at 60c the fan will be at 38%, at 70c the fan will be at 48%, and so on. Seems to be perfectly adequate for cooling during gaming, and I'm seeing max temps of around 73-74c under load at 51-52% fan speed with the script. You can modify the offset value however works for you.

To run the script, just make a copy locally and save it, chmod the file with a value of 755 (or just chown it, whatever), and call it with ""bash ./filename.sh"" If you do ""bash ./filename.sh -v"" it will do verbose output to the console and display the fan speed and gpu temp at each interval (8 seconds by default). If you're doing this from a remote terminal, you can use ctrl+z and then bg to set it as a background job, or just call it with the & symbol at the end when starting it so it doesn't take over the terminal session.

Be aware, you need to be using the proprietary Nvidia driver for this to work, and you'll need to enable cool bit for fan control via ""sudo nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4"" (or --cool-bits=12 if you'd also like to enable overclocking). Then reboot for the cool-bit value change to take effect. A value of 4 enables manual fan control, 8 for OC in nvidia-settings. 12 enables both. You can also enable voltage control in addition to the rest with a value of 28.

This only works on more recent revisions of the Nvidia driver (I believe versions above 340). I'm on Ubuntu 18.04, and this should work on at minimum 16.04 and up, plus other distros with similar versions and kernels. If you have a really old distro or much older drivers for some reason, you can use the script I originally based mine on, which can be found at the link below:

So this review will mostly be only about the performance of the unit, and no comparisons.

So I stuck this into the Acer TC-780 Desktop along with a nicer PSU. The case was a bit of a tight fit, but it works as intended.

I initially had issues with the card, occasionally it would turn completely off leaving me with a black screen, this may have been a power issue because after unplugging many of my consoles, I have had no issues and it now performs well.

It runs many older games decently at 4k, and I can get some newer games to operate well at that resolution, the card has issues properly handling it. However many games released in the last three years run amazing at 1080p or 1440p and the GTX 1060 handles most games well, even heavily demanding games like The Witcher 3. However I did have many many issues with Assassin's Creed Origins, although that was probably more of an issue with the game itself. When fully utilized in a game, the max temperature I've had has been 75°C with no overclocking. When I was benchmarking with a small overclock, it had reached 80°C but that probably will never happen within a game. About overclocking, this card handles it ""okay"" but hasn't wowed me. Anything over a +125 mhz overclock causes games to crash and I can't push memory clocks too high as it does cause artifacting among other issues. Overclocking the card does definitely help performance in some games if you favor a higher resolution like I do, but don't want to sacrifice fps too much.

Overall, for my budget, it's a great GPU and it runs laps around the PS4 and Xbox One that I'm used to playing games on. I'm hoping that this review is somewhat informative."

If you overlook something in your research, then you spend more time and money trying to correct it. Also for this review, I use GPU, card, and graphics card interchangeably.

I've wanted to play the more recent console games that have also been coming out for PC, but my NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 GPU for desktop couldn't keep up...not even close. I spent quite a while researching and deliberating between this graphics card or the higher benchmarked 1070 or 1080 version (including the Ti versions) NVIDIA cards. I ultimately went with this 1060 6GB SC from EVGA as I could keep my current power supply unit, and didn't need to replace my 6 pin connector (which would have added to the cost up front and slightly higher electric demand). I'm not considering using ultra-high graphics or manually overclocking this GPU anyways. My logic was it would last me about as long as a console, but was happy to noticed it improved the quality of the display for images/movies over the original, lower-performing 730 GPU. So I might even be able to benefit from it longer still.

Installation: I use Windows 10--not sure if this is important, but maybe helpful for you. I've never installed a graphics card in my life, so after reading/watching how it was done online, I found it superbly easy once inside the machine. Ridiculously easy even. I did have some trouble with the software installing from CD (the EVGA website has it anyways all nicely updated so it saves time from needing a second update), but the included benchmarking software (including one for VR) went on a-okay. Was way easier then expected.

Impressions during play/viewing: Remember how I said my old, basic 730 GPU couldn't keep up with newer games? This1060 SC graphics card fixes a 1-5 second processing delay the old GPU gave me (and I was really sacrificing graphics quality on that old card). Now, I am running with higher quality graphic settings in-game and my gameplay is no longer lagging from intense graphics. No problems yet during gameplay with STEAM's and NVIDIA software's recommended settings, and the only periods in gameplay it seemed to have trouble with was graphically intense cutscenes. [Not sure if that is really this card's fault as the game is a hybrid between local files and network connection.] The fan on this card is probably the noisiest one on my whole desktop (become aware when the fan kicks up, but it's nowhere near jump-scaring me), but I hear that noise level is common across all these NVIDIA 10-series GPUs. I'm glad EVGA designs their fans to be slightly quieter because of this. Other games that worked with my old GPU (think RPGs, World of Warships, etc) actually look sharper for better or worse (it highlights quality of detail the designers put into it the game, but also highlights some of the graphical imperfections--still not complaining though since stuff loads great at on good quality settings). Outside of gameplay, my background images that cycle for my PC are significantly enhanced both in textures and colors. To give you an idea, one of my backgrounds is a landscape that has a brushstroke effect that is now showing up significantly clearer--something I could notice on my old 730 GPU, but nothing with this detail.

Other impressions: It's not a full-length desktop card, but the card has significant bulk and heft to it. Was actually surprised by the size and how sturdy it looked and felt since I mostly know friends that use gaming laptops. As far as detail goes, others are commenting on how much sharper things look from my PC now, and I haven't even changed my monitor! I'm sure this already is obvious, but if you are gaming expect heat generation. Keep that in mind in case its hot outside or now that winter is coming.

Will update should anything change or find something else out that's cool about it."

I did use the following products also to overclock with this:

Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut Thermal Grease Paste - 1.0 Gram

Titan Adjustable PCIE FAN ( Placed under the EVGA GTX 1060 for increased airflow )
Titan Adjustable Dual Fan PCI Slot VGA Cooler (TTC-SC07TZ)

Sally Hansen Clear Nail Polish ( For covering the capacitors and power connectors around the GPU because Nail Polish is Non-Conductive )
Sally Hansen Color Therapy Nail Polish, Top Coat 0.5 Ounce Long-Lasting Nail Polish with Gel Shine and Nourishing Care

DISCLAIMER: I don't recommend you try the modifications I have in my review unless you know what you are doing, do so at your own risk as this most likely will void your warranty. But if $350 doesn't matter to you and you are an expert, then read on.

I first unscrewed the cooler from the Graphics Card on the back plate with 4 phillips screws and disconnected the side fan connector, this exposed the copper heat sink and the GPU. I used Alcohol Wipes to gently remove all of the stock GPU Paste and waited a few minutes to dry, then I used the Sally Hansen Color Theraphy Nail Polish, which by the way is NON CONDUCTIVE and is safe to use, by applying it around the GPU Die on the capacitors and power connectors creating a protective cover. I waited 10 minutes for it to dry and then applied 3 more layers, this was done to prevent a power short circuit in case liquid metal got on the capacitors around the GPU Die. Just to be clear the Nail Polish was placed around the GPU and note directly on it. Once the Capacitors were completely covered in Nail Polish, I placed a pea sides amount of liquid metal on the GPU Die and used the QTIP to spread it nice and evenly on the GPU Die like butter.

Turning on my computer the Idle Temperature went from 42 Degrees Stock Paste to 36 Degrees Ambient Temperature with the Liquid Metal.

Starting off with testing, I did download the latest drivers from EVGA Website and as of this review it is display driver 398.11 with BIOS 86.06.68.00.62 as of 06/06/2018.

Stock the card does come with a stock clock speed of 1607 MHz / Real Boost Clock: 1835 MHz. However, I was able to get that up to 2164 Mhz on the GPU Clock and 4498 Mhz on the Memory clock.

Using the following settings with my modifications, I downloaded EVGA Precision OC from EVGA's website and also EVGA Scanner X

For EVGA Precision OC I used the following settings:

Turn on KBOOST ( Forces GPU to operate at full boost clock 100% of the time)

120% Power Target (This is your TDP - Thermal Design Power) - Gives your Graphics Card 20% more power for higher overclocks
Break the link for both Power Target and Temperature ( You want this so that you get more power regardless of temperature)
Set Priority to Power Target

For Voltage I set it to 70%
For Fan Speed, I set it to 70% ( It's loud but I can use a Gaming Headset )

GPU Clock Speed Offset set to +160 Mhz
Memory Clock Offset set to +496 Mhz

Also Motherboard Southbridge Voltage was increased to 1.25 Volts, VDDR Voltage increased to 1.25 Volts, VDDR PCIE Voltage increased to 1.25 Volts. This was done to increase power delivery to the Graphics Card from the PCIE Slot on the motherboard due to the high 120% TDP.

Running a stress test for at 4K Resolution at 3840 x 2160 Pixels with 8X MSAA produced a steady frame rate of 43 Frames Per Second at 65 Degrees Celcius, up from 10 Frames Per Second at stock and this test ran for 10 minutes rendering over 25,000 Frames without crashing.

This pretty much turned my GTX 1060 into a GTX 1070 for a much lower price as the 1070's sell for about $500 and made gaming at 4K on the 1060 to be actually playable.

Gamers probably won't need to run 8X MSAA and can do just fine with 2X MSAA when Gaming at 4K with my modifications since you can't really notice jagged edges at 2X Anti Aliasing and 4K and overclocked the frames never ran below 30 Frames per second.

Final Conclusion:

The EVGA GTX 1060 6GB overclocks like a champ and with liquid metal, great cooling fans from your case and a PCIE Fan Cooler, you can easily turn your overclocked 1060 into a stock 1070 when running at 4K Resolution that is 24/7 Stable. Your results may vary with the Silicon Lottery, but I highly recommend this product if you are buying it with overclocking in mind, it does great. Pushing it past 2,200 Mhz however did not happen for me and most I was able to do was 2164 Mhz, it is probably possible to go to 2,200 Mhz by doing shunting mods, but that is probably a 2-4% increase in performance from 2164 Mhz and honestly not worth it IMO."

The final options were the GTX 1050Ti 4GB VRAM and the GTX 1060 3 or 6 GB VRAM, all in the SuperClocked (SC) version (with SC the card automatically overclocks itself in demand within maximum temperature/frequency limits, a great feature for an additional ~$10).
I chose the GTX 1060/3GB as the best ""bang for the buck"", as it was reviewed and benchmarked significantly faster than the 1050 for a slight cost premium, and the slight additional performance of the 6GB version over the 3GB wasn't justified by the additional cost, and my requirement for less than maximum gaming performance at 1080P, 150 FPS and Ultra resolution settings...
One thing I learned was that the GTX 1050 cards install without an additional power connection, while the GTX 1060 and up require a 6 pin power connector from the power supply. In many modern computers, this connector is supplied, but in older PCs, it may be missing, but that can be ""worked around"" with a MOLEX/6 pin adapter.
When it came to which manufacturer to use, the EVGA rated the best value and performance, so it was the vendor of choice.
Installation was painless, but many web reviews recommended upgrading the BIOS to the latest version to ensure the XPS 8900 would boot properly. *

* An ancillary problem with the BIOS upgrade was that after updating the BIOS, I logged in to Windows 10 with my personal ID, but the PC booted into the generic ADMINISTRATOR account. The result was that it booted into the bare bones blue generic Windows desktop, with all but a dozen of my desktop shortcuts missing... After some colorful language, I accidentally discovered that Windows had somehow booted into Win 10 from my log in to the ADMIN account..."

I bought this card worried about just that, and let me tell you, I'm eagerly surprised. I haven't taken the shroud off of the card to put new paste on it either; a proper fan profile with Afterburner or PrecisionX and you'll be just fine. I haven't seen my card go over 63C, and it's rated to tolerate much higher. Plus, in Afterburner it autoclocks it to 2000MHz, though it runs anywhere from 400 to 1600 with idling and light gaming.

The most 'intensive' games I play revolves around Doom (2016), Rust, GTA V, Metro Last Light and The Forest. I don't know the exact average, but I'll put what I remember from said games in regards to frames per second.

Also keep in mind the processor can also affect performance, as well as the RAM when it comes to Ryzen. I'm using a Ryzen 5 1600 and 8GB Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM.

Doom: Ran everything on Ultra/highest possible settings on everything, 1920 x 1080. Dipped slightly below 60FPS once in a blue moon, but never under 57FPS. Very smooth.

Rust: Honestly Rust still has some sketchy optimization, but it never drops under 70FPS (1920 x 1080, minimal settings w/FXAA on and a render distance of 2,500) for me. I've also played w/everything maxed out on some empty/almost empty servers and averaged right around 85FPS. Of course, that's an empty world; a populated world got me right around 45FPS (200 out of 300 slots being played) which is playable, but definitely not recommended for a game like Rust.

Metro Last Light: Never went below 60 FPS. Everything on Ultra, 1920 x 1080. If you never want to go below 60FPS with the same setup as I have, just turn everything on High instead of Ultra. The look is negligibly different.

The Forest: Is optimized horribly, so your experience may vary. Usually 50+ FPS on mid-high settings, but going Ultra on a game that's still in alpha is honestly a stupid decision anyhow.

GTA V: Most settings on High, population density smack dab in the middle. Game looks pretty, never drops below 75FPS. 1920 x 1080.

I love this little card. It's cute as a button but performs like an Olympian."

But as for Ubuntu, b/c I am using an AMD mobo, I have no integrated graphics card. This means that I need to have the drivers for this new graphics card installed BEFORE I install this card.
Thus, I ended up installing the card first - nothing on my screen. -Panic-
Reinstalled my old card - googled bunch of solutions for 20-30 minutes
Finally found the right one - plugged the card back in after installing the required drivers + purging old ones.
It worked! Finally.
Anyways, I am just thankful that people care about linux users period, so I don't blame any company etc.
As for performance, I mainly just got it since I wanted to support a 4k monitor - and it's ballin'! I love it.
As for gaming, I can run starcraft 2 on Medium with no issues with fps running 4k - really depends on the map though. Some campaign maps are super full with stuff + it get's slow unless I drag it down to low. But that's 4k for ya.
So if you want to just run games - set it to 1080p.
I can run league of legends on max settings with no issues fps wise running 4k.
I mean it's hard to be attached to something that just gives you ability to run things - so I don't really love it or hate it - but I am glad it just works as intended. 4k ftw! I am tired of writing papers on 1080p - hurts my eyes so bad."

To compensate for the small, hot air pocket that it inevitably ends up sitting it it has to crank up the fan speed. It is loud, really loud. Like the old days of custom hack saws and fan mods days loud. You better have some sound dampening headphones.

Ok, yes, I know. The 660 is several generations older and so of course the 1060 would be faster, duh. However, what I am so impressed with is how well this card performs when gaming at 1080p @ 60Hz, meaning you don't need more than 60fps. I'm able to game at high or ultra settings on games like Fallout 4, Batman Arkham Knight, Crysis 3, Titanfall, Witcher 3 and others at or above 60fps average. There are dips in frames, but this is due more to my CPU than the card. I'm currently using an AMD FX 4350 OC'd to 4.6Ghz, and it just can't keep this GPU fed with enough data. Card sits at times at about 35%-45% utilization while my CPU is pegged at or near 99%, so CPU bottleneck.

I would recommend this card to anyone looking to game at 1080p @ 60fps on triple-A titles. (If you play WOW, Rocket League, or esport games then go with the 1050ti.) The single fan does plenty to keep the card cooled, and with good airflow in your case it can actually overclock itself even higher. The 3GB VRam does impose a limit on 1440p gaming (lower fps), and 4k is a no-go on most titles, but for those of us on 1080p monitors this card is a beast."

I got this quite a few months back, and at the time graphics cards were still at a premium due to crypto currency mining. I researched performance of the different models, and realized the 1060s were far better than the 1050s, and only slightly slower than the 1070s, with the 1080s being way out of my price range. And despite some really adamant bloggers complaining about the diminished architecture of the 3GB version, in real world performance testing, the 3gb and 6gb cards were functioning nearly identical. So when this particular card went on sale, I jumped on it. I've had no problems with EVGA products in the past, and they tend to out preform the competition with their OC models.

One nice thing is size. It was easier to both install and remove, because there isn't more card blocking access to the PCIe x16 riser lock. When everything else is hooked up, that can be difficult to get to.

Another great thing is that it needs just a single fan. That means it's quiet. And unless the graphics are getting really intense, that fan doesn't even need to run much of the time.

This card comes with a good combination of ports. Ok, so to hook up all there of my dvi monitors, I had to buy two new cables, but it does support several monitors, which is great when working from home.

Note: I honestly haven't looked into whether or not this card supports 3d output to multiple monitors, since most games do a terrible job of supporting it.

I'm not an FPS fan, but I did want better performance and quality from the games I do play (Battletech, Fallout, a bunch of steam games, etc.). This card was an upgrade to my old PC, replacing a GTX570, and it significantly improved my frame rates, with higher quality settings.

I've since built a new PC based off the i5-9600k, and this is still a perfect video card for what I'm playing right now. I'm playing all my games on the highest quality settings, and maxing the refresh rate of my aging 60Hz monitors. I expect I'll upgrade in a year or two, and probably buy a new gaming monitor at that time, too. For now, this still meet my needs, and I'm very happy with it.

I haven't seen any graphical glitches, or had any crashes. The Nvidia driver installs are flawless, as always.

There is a utility from EVGA, Precision XOC, that looks great for those that really want to control their overclock settings, but I haven't had need to mess with it at all."

I was upgrading from a 750ti, and was so impressed by the increase in power from the start. The software should be downloaded, as I found out the shocking way, you can get the fan up to 10,000 rpm, at 100% it should be less than half of that, so opps on my part. However, that should speak for the durability, as this was a used card when I got it. It came to me super clean, I mean, I still had to peel tiny bits of plastic off. Made me feel kind of good, like it was new. might as well had bee, this was/is pristine! So clean, not one spec of dust, EVEN had a slight new hardware smell still on .

Gaming on this setup is actually pretty good, especially for older titles that are still fun to play. Even the new DOOM game will run at full detail using the new Vulkan API update. Now, this is not as powerful as a GTX 1080Ti but its no slouch either and doesn't have a huge power draw. This is a great pairing for a 1080p monitor if you are a gamer on a budget. If you are considering a 1050Ti, and you have a powerful enough PSU, the GTX 1060 is more than twice as fast since that is what is just what I replaced. EVGA also has a great warranty and support."

In Shadow of the Tomb Raider, I have the image settings at Ultra, Ray Tracing Shadows at High, and HDR enabled. It benchmarked at 100 fps max, 55 fps avg, and 37 fps min. I have also played Metro Exodus with similar settings, as well as DLSS enabled, and had similar or better benchmark scores. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019 performs even better. I was able to play the same games on a 4k, 144Hz monitor with lower FPS, but smooth game play that never dipped below 30 FPS. There was no stuttering or artifacting. The card with it's triple fan cooler never went above 68 Centigrade and the fans never ran more than 1200 rpm. The card remained silent throughout the games and testing. I haven't overclocked it yet because there really has been no need to. I will probably give the beta MSI After Burner program for RTX card overclocking a try. It seems very simple because it will do all the overclocking automatically, except for the memory. The card is visually pleasant to look at with its RGB rainbow scheme. Aside from price this card is a real winner. It definitely makes more sense than the RTX 2080 Ti, since there are rumors of a Ti Super coming in early 2020, as well as the AMD ""nvidia killer"" coming by summer next year. Save the $500 difference and wait to see what comes. If you own a 1080 Ti you might want to wait till next year when the new cards come out, unless you really want RTX now. I hope this has been helpful.
Edit: I finally did overclock the card with MSI AfterBurner which gave me a modest boost that resulted in about 10% performance boost without any overheating, throttling or other problems. This is an excellent card."

So it is literally silent until you jump into a game, and even when you're in a game it barely makes any noise. Inside of your PC with everything else going (fans, CPU cooler, etc) you won't even hear it.

This card has some overclocking headroom, topping out at around 2040MHz but the 8GB of GDDR6 went from 15.5Gbps (which is already fast) up to a blistering 18Gbps which results in 568GB/sec of memory bandwidth.

Most games over 100fps, CoD modern warfare at 60-70fps with ray tracing and everything. If you have normal smaller monitors I recommend the 2070 super. If you game on high refresh monitors with rates above 60hz or want to game in 4k then get this 2080 super or 2080 ti. This card has great software and sweet looking rgb effects. It’s quiet and cools well, even with the fans ramped up. I prefer to have the fans running than having them turn off when low load. That way the card stays cool and extends life. The card is massive and heavy, make sure you have room. It is a bit thicker than my old 1080 by like half an inch with a larger heat sink/fins. With the fan speeds set to where I like, GPU temps never go above 50c even under high load. I do run a open air thermaltake core p3 case, so I suppose an enclosed case would run a little hotter."

Have to return.,"It is with great sadness that I must return this video card. It seems to have an unresolved issue with AMD motherboards and processors. This issue causes the video card drivers to crash. It is logged in the Windows event log as Event ID 14, from the nvlddmkm Nvidia driver.

This crash triggers very consistently when I run a game like Rimworld. Oddly, running something 3d-intensive like Star Citizen does NOT consistently trigger the driver crash, though it still does happen after playing for a long while. Having multiple monitors also seems to exacerbate the problem, especially when turning them on and off (displayport interface apparently treats a monitor in standby as if it were actually disconnected from the computer, so it resizes the desktop).

After doing some research, and speaking with Nvidia support, it would seem that the problem lies with some kind of incompatibility between the Turing architecture of this video card, and Ryzen chipset motherboards. And after making sure I had a clean install of the latest video card drivers (I used DDU), as well as the latest bios and chipset drivers, and STILL I have this problem... well, I just don't trust this generation of Nvidia cards to work with my Ryzen 9 setup.

So, I am returning this card. I would get an ATI card, I hear the Radeon VII is excellent. However, for the same price point, it is under the 2080 Super in benchmarks by about 10-12%. So I guess I'm just going to have to continue using my old 980 Ti, and wait another year or so and see if anything changes. Maybe some new drivers or firmware will have this solved by then.

Oh well."

Like i stated in the description the card looks beautiful and the RGB's are the reason for it. Is by far the best looking RGB GPU card out there. Countless RGB presets once you install MSI mystic light software.

Con's

Oh boy here we go. There are many problems that i have been experiencing with this product. The card is streamly unstable. The problems has been many from Computer freezing and crashing. GPU randomly Tend to go into full power mode and all 3 fans would get at full speed and a really loud noise like is airplane about to take off and that is fallow by a freeze and a black screen and a computer crash. other times it would get really hot. this problems happen randomly and sometimes they happen right away as soon as i turn on the computer and while GPU is still at really cool temperature's and other times it happened hours later after the computer is on and not all of them happen at the same time.

Everything is up-to-date - Latest GPU drivers and everything that's install in my computer is up to date with latest drivers. I can't really tell if is a bad defected GPU or the card is just that unstable bad which it make's it useless because you can be playing a game and randomly you get hit by any of this problems especially the one where the GPU fans would go into full speed power mode like is jet about to take off and it crashes the computer. Plus the case is very well ventilated with 7 fans that keep's everything cool.

Final comments

The worst part about all this is that It lasted long enough for the 30 days return window to come and past like it usually does then it breaks down and it gives you hell. Plus i can't enjoy my card and i bought this through Amazon monthly installments and i still owe nearly 300 dollars for this defected product to Amazon. It is really hard to be paying for something that does not work.

I have also contacted the products manufactured through phone and online and they are nearly impossible to reach and the few times that i manage to get a customer representative they kept giving and continue to give me the run around for nearly a month now and nothing have come out of it. They keep insisting that there are things to troubleshoot the problems. I have been dealing with computers for over 20 years and i know when something is defective and no longer working and this product is defective and no longer working properly."

I was getting btw 100-140 fps with Raytracing on in warzone. Card is a beast. I would've given it a 5/5 but sadly I experienced a blank screen followed by GPU fan at 100% load randomly. The issue started occurring more and more often each passing week. Only way to get out is to hard reset the PC.

I did everything MSI support advised me to do and still unable to rid of the problem.
From Bios update + new cables + different ports + fresh install + DDU (Display Driver Uninstall) and much more.
I tried a different card and did not experienced that black screen + GPU fan going 100% load.

I had to ship the card for an RMA. In over a decade of gaming I've never had a video card I buy fail on me til now. I think I'll be sticking with Gigabyte, EVGA or Asus next time.

Edit:
May 2020
Wanted to say I am pleased with the time it took for MSI to repair and ship back the video card. It took 2 weeks max from date received. Although I was not happy having to foot the bill to ship the defective card, I am happy with the overall solution and a working video card.

June 3th 2020: It worked flawlessness for 3 weeks then the same issue started occurring again. Now I have to RMA that GPU again and foot the bill to ship it....

I asked for brand new card at this point instead of a repair. I hope they comply and that this is the last RMA otherwise I'll be back to update this section.

Update: June 6,2020
Final update.
It seems MSI repair center won't give me a brand new card. I guess they rather I refund through amazon @ 20% restock fee and lose me as a customer after having spent $1000s on their product in past.

I ended up going for EVGA's 2080 due to well known customer services."

It also made a faint buzzing noise whenever I highlighted any of the lines that were on the screen. It took me about 2 or 3 days to diagnose the problem as the graphics card, but when I replaced it with an EVGA 2080 Super everything worked just fine, so I am sure that the graphics card was the problem. I tested the PC with different cables, plugging the cables into different ports in the graphics card, I tried using different monitors, and I was successful in receiving a normal screen with the CPU integrated graphics, and everything ended up pointing to the GPU as my problem. Normally I'm sure this would have been a great product had everything worked just fine, but it didn't, and I felt a need to share my experience."

I was running an Intel I7 processor and AMD Fury X graphics card and ironically updated to an AMD Ryzen 9 processor and an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super graphics card. I will say that I had to think long and hard to pull the trigger on the NVIDIA card because of the cost. Man, this card is expensive but I figured this would be the last major computer build I will do, so decided to pay the extra cost. If not this card, I would have gone with the AMD 5700 at half the cost for about 75% of the performance, a much better value. However, I do not have buyers remorse for this beast of a card. It rips through anything I can throw at it and benchmarks amazingly well. I'v even gotten back into some gaming and wow! I turn every graphics options to max and the detail in the games is awesome. You would think that when pushing the card the three fans (Tri-Frozr) would scream but, on the contrary, you can barley hear them. This card is extremely quiet, which eliminates the need to liquid cool it. As a bonus, the LEDs on the card look great. After running this card for a couple of months I am extremely pleased and found nothing to complain about other than the cost."

So, this card is not only a mega monster, but super super silent 1. without case fans, the fans on the GPU are 100% silent. im not joking. i put my head damn near in my pc, when i had the liquid cooler fans (2 130mm) and the 3 fans on the GPU, its literally 100% quite. you wont be able to know your pc is on.

My pc i built before the current build i just did, could barely and very laggedly run a game call ""kingdom come: deliverance"" a game made powered by alienware. so you know its quite demanding. the game was made in 2018. my old pc would bog down, even on the lowest of settings. this card, runs this game on max settings, pulling out the 144mhz refresh rate just fine. thats without over clocking the GPU. i run games such as Star Citizen, black desert remastered, hunt the showdown and more all on max settings pull out 144mhz like its nothing. this car is an amazing buy. im actually considering buying another to use SLI and not have to worry of upgrading my pc for many years."

The 2080 Super does a good job with 1440p. I have an MSI MEG Ace motherboard with metal reinforced full-size PCIe slots and I have no need for the included GPU bracket or a third-party support. The graphics card is well-built and does not sag.

The included bracket has a non-neutral red color theme, it is relatively ugly and doesn't actually fit the graphics card well. It is the weakest point in the whole package and I'm glad I haven't needed to use it.

I haven't invested a lot of time with the overclocking software. I found that the stock/automatic boost works well. I don't care for the MSI Afterburner software. I think they focused entirely too much attention on creating a ""cool"" interface when they should have made something more minimal with options and feedback that are clearer for the user."

I ordered this card used from amazon cause it looked like a good deal,waited a week and when it got here,i made a video and unboxed it, did this cause i saw other people saying not to order used from amazon. Once i looked at the card i saw that the serial was for a rtx 2080, not a rtx 2080 super. Then when i installed it and checked it out on my computer it was confirmed to be a standard rtx 2080 and not the super version. Amazon will only refund money and not do a replacement of the card since its a used card i purchased(understandable)but amazon should have picked that up cause it was inspected by them it said. What is happening is people are returning their non super cards to get a free upgrade, in some cases people are returning 2070 cards for 2080 super cards, and 1080 ti cards for 2080 ti cards. ( thats a big difference in price and performance)My lose is not to big since it was still a 2080. This happens cause the cards look the same,and amazon doesn't check the serial number,or see if the serial numbers have been swapped. The 2080 still performs good and is a solid card,but was expecting a 2080 super."

So, I sent that card back (they gave me a prepaid label for this one but all the other times I had to pay shipping). I finally get a working refurbished card. Now two weeks later the card is starting to have problems again. I tested theses cards on two systems and ran them fine with older cards. I guess I’ll keep RMAing it but the 3 year warranty lifespan is not what I expected when I paid over $700 dollars for this.

The noise on the graphics card fans is virtual non existent. The only time you’ll hear the fans is when you activate the cooler boost in the dragon center.

Gaming
The Gaming is flawless. No matter what game, graphics settings, or whatever. Do not expect less than 60fps ever unless your really rampin things up.

Important notes:
The Graphics card came with a GPU bracket, a super cute cartoon like manual that explains everything clearly, it’s well wrapped and ports are protected.
I’m also very please with the RGB on the card however, I’m kind of disappointed I can’t see the RGB on the fans since they’re facing downwards.
Downside: The 2080 Super isn’t actually worth the price when it comes down to frames/performance to the dollar."
44.0,ZOTAC GeForce GT 1030 2GB GDDR5 64-bit PCIe 3.0 DirectX 12 HDCP Ready Low Profile Video Card ZT-P10300A-10L,Zotac,Nvidia,6000 MHz,2 GB,$84.99,4.7 out of 5 stars,It's truly a single-slot card,"After buying the Acer TC-885 mini-PC, I found that the built-in Intel UHD graphics controller is only capable of 4K at 30Hz, which causes a fair bit of tearing such as when large windows are dragged across the screen. The built-in controller also uses main memory rather than dedicated GDDR RAM.

Because the TC-885 has two PCIe slots (spaced at standard distance) and I was going to be using both, I needed a 4K60-capable graphics card with HDMI 2.0 in a single-slot form factor. My first choice was the MSI GT 1030 2GH LP OC which is the only NVidia 1030 card with HDMI and DisplayPort, but alas the heat sinks are too thick and the card occupies 1.5 or 2 slot widths. I returned that card and purchased this, despite having to give up the DisplayPort.

But I have no regrets. This card fits entirely within the envelope of one slot and still leaves a gap between it and a PCIe card in the adjacent slot. At 4K60, the screen tearing issues are resolved, and the combination of a Pascal core and GDDR5 graphics memory produces a significantly better viewing experience."

It takes up very little space, it runs cool, it runs quiet, and of course brings with it the excellent functionality of the NVIDIA control panel. It won't be rendering demanding games at high frame rates, but for basic gaming it absolutely gets the job done. It also draws all power from the motherboard, with no additional connectors required.

If you're looking for a proper gaming card, you'd be better served by stepping up to a GTX 1050 ti, but if you just want to give a cheap older machine a little oomph, need a nice solution to a build without integrated graphics, or just want to fuss around with light gaming, this is your pick. You also cannot go wrong with Zotac. They are hands down my current favorite GPU manufacturer, and I go with them for every one of my purchases.

One thing to keep in mind is that this card does not support NVIDIA ShadowPlay, so I ended up having to return mine once I'd realized that. Outside of that one problem, it suited all of my needs."

I did run into an issue where my mobo wasn't seeing the card but a quick update of its BIOS fixed the issue. The card runs relatively cool and quiet in a case with poor airflow.

I ordered the card, received it ... I think it was four or maybe five days later. I installed it right away, and was instantly pleased. Framerates went up tenfold with no change in settings to the game I bought the card to play. Where I was able to get 25 fps with only the lowest most basic settings and resolution, I now could get 50 fps with everything at least in the 50-75% range, and several settings at their maxima.

Then about two weeks later I noticed the odd occasional glitch. Chalking it up to possible overheating (I have this in a SFF machine), I checked the temperature readings and they were right at 60 degrees Celsius, WELL within the operating range of the card (I don't have exact specs but according to my research, 85 degrees is considered the norm for a card of this type in an SFF machine when under load). For good measure, I opened the case and kept a fan blowing on it, which kept the temps a degree or two lower, but that's it, and the glitches continued to get worse. Highlights, specular effects, details of 3D objects like clouds... eventually even individual characters of text displayed on the screen in-game were missing. Clear and obvious signs of progressive failure of the hardware.

Finally I went to the Zotac website to request an RMA -- this was three weeks ago if memory serves -- and I never heard back. Fortunately, Amazon agreed to a return and full refund, so I've sent the card back in to Amazon. I'm awaiting a refund of the full purchase price to my original method of payment, and then I'll be replacing this card with a similar model of a different brand.

I'm sure I'm just that one person out of ten thousand who had a problem, though. Right?"

First you can't dial the speed down below 85% even when using the GPU for everyday non-3D 'office' use. Secondly even at 85% the fan has a high-pitched whine that wasn't ""loud"" but was definitely annoying and could be heard over everything else in the room.

I've since replaced this with the MSI version and it's whisper quiet. Can't even tell if the fan is actually on. Lesson learned! Only removing two stars because the core functionality (GPU) was OK, even with the highly annoying fan noise. For reference, this was installed in a Dell Optiplex 5050 SFF computer."

So most systems should be able to use it. I play mostly older less demanding games in 1920 by 1080. The games I have tried on this video card so far. Euro Truck simulator 2 a lot of settings are either high or medium at 100% scaling. I got a steady 60fps. The next game I fired up was Grim Dawn. Medium to low on some things to get a 60frames per second. The video card is not powerful but it does a good job of keeping playable frame rates in my games.

I think for more modern games that are graphics heavy it might have trouble getting 60fps unless you drop the resolution to 720. The card is very silent or at least mine was. So if your looking for a card that can play games at playable frame rates then this is a good choice. I tried using my onboard graphics card to play games. Its a Intel HD530. This is a much better choice. Grim Dawn with everything set at low or off 20 fps with the Intel HD530.

So I downloaded the over clocking software from Zotac website. I then fired up Forza 7. I did have to set the resolution to 720 and I got a steady 45fps everything set to low. So this video card will play Forza 7. This video is like owning a gtx 750. So far its been a solid buy."

Fits perfectly in the SFF chassis and I can now play HEVC 4K at 60hz on it beautifully, with the stock PSU which I believe is rated at 240W. I don't do any gaming so I can't speak to that but if you just want to watch 4K content and have a media pc that is struggling with 4K HEVC- buy this card, you won't regret it."

Installation was easy. The ONLY issue I had was that as soon as I booted my Windows 10 box, it took a bit of time to download the Nvidia drivers--my PC looked stuck on the bootup screen, but it wasn't. After I waited for windows to boot, the card just worked.

It's not the most powerful video card, but it's power consumption is very low at 30 watts and is small enough to fit in any SFF desktop. The ZOTAC Firestorm utility is useful for controlling fan settings and overclocking (although I don't personally overclock) and is useful for displaying temperature of the GPU.

This is overall a great buy for anyone looking to upgrade a poorly-configured prebuilt without upgrading any other components like the power supply."

It's easy to install. I had no problem with drivers when switching it out. It fits low profile and regular, though you do have to set the phyical end stem (not at all sure what's it's called) in the correct position - very easy to do. If your pc can handle a beefier card, you might consider doing that, but if you're playing games that are not resource hogs, this should work just fine."

They work well, but I had some issues during the first boot on both Windows 10 machines. The machines were mostly unresponsive to the point that I nearly removed the new card on the first one. It lasted at least 5 minutes, maybe more. Perhaps it was due to huge Windows update driver downloads in the background. In the end, both systems work great and can play games that weren't playable at all before. I'm only a casual gamer. The benchmark for these was Red Faction ""Re-marstered"" from Gog."

Am Anfang war ich durch die negativen Bewertungen etwas abgeneigt, habe mich dann aber dennoch entschlossen die Grafikkarte für rund 300Euro hier bei Amazon zu bestellen.

Die Lieferung war schnell und es ist alles wie gewohnt heile angekommen. (Leider etwas wenig Verpackungsmaterial Amazon, der Karton der Karte war recht lose im Umkarton) bitte beim nächsten mal nicht am Papier sparen!.

Weiter im Text, Karte ausgepackt, eingebaut, und Tadaa wir haben Bild.
Alle meine Spiele laufen 1080P mit mehr als Knapp 140FPS bei Ultra Settings.
Der Takt der Karte wird stabil gehalten und die Lüfterkurve ist ebenfalls super abgestimmt.

!!ANMERKUNG!!
Falls ihr ein System mit Windows7 nutzt rate ich euch auf Windows10 zu Upgraden! Der Optimate Treiber der RX580 steht nur windows 10 zur verfügung und somit ist auch die Leistung unter windows10 besser.
Des weiteren erkennt Win7 auch nur 4 von 8GB der Grafikkarte.

Habe hier einiges gelesen von (""nach einem Monat Defekt"" bis hin zu ""schwache Leistung"") und das mehrfach, dem kann ich mich NICHT anschließen! Der Takt wird stabil gehalten und die Karte bleibt selbst bei vollauslastung schön kühl.

Die Optik ist wie bei meiner vor einem Jahr gekauften Strix 1060 wiedermal super.

Es gibt nicht DIE perfekte Karte, jeder muss für sich selbst sein Pixelmator finden.
für mich war es eben die Asus Strix, und diese kann ich mit bestem wissen und GEwissen empfehlen.

1-10 wobei (1) für sehr schlecht und (10) für sehr gut steht.
Optik: 10
Sromaufnahme: 9
Lautstärke: 10
Leistung: 10
Haltbarkeit: 10 (wobei wir das nach der Garantie erst wissen)

Kurz und knapp, für 300Euro eine sehr sehr schöne und Leistungsstarke Grafikkarte mit zeitgemäßer RGB beleuchtung und genügen Vram sowie Leistung fürs Spielen der nächsten 3Jahre in 1080P!
Falls die Karte aber wieder auf 350Euro steigt würde ich eher abstand halten, da man für 50Euro mehr eine 1070 bekommt welche nochmal ein drittel der Leistung mehr bietet.

Hoffe ich konnte bei der Kaufentscheidung helfen."

Si destaco 4 estrellas sobre 5 es porque AMD como siempre tiene el tema de los drivers un poco a su manera, dando algún error el software ""Adrenaline"" cuando le viene sin motivo aparente, pero al menos, sé por experiencia que con el paso del tiempo terminan mejorando tanto el software como el rendimiento."

45.0,Asus Radeon RX 580 STRIX 8GB GDDR5 Graphics Card,Asus,AMD,8000 MHz,8 GB,$24.89,4.6 out of 5 stars,No-signal issues,"I had major no-signal issue few days back. No signal whatsoever from DP ports, however, the HDMI ports worked fine (tested the card on another Intel PC via HDMI, and it worked great, after that tested via HDMI on my machine, and it worked). Using Intel CPU. When installing 18.11.1 Radeon drivers, during installation, the screen suddenly went PINK (yes, 100% pink color, no text). Then after restart, no signal. Even ASUS MoBo refused to start and only lit the white VGA LED. When booting only with MoBo display adapter connected, it failed to boot with this card connected.

Theories:
- DP connector touches to computer chassis, I changed the X580 card position slightly so that there was more room around the DP connector
- some other connection poorly connected, maybe the 12v additional cable connecting to X580
- for some reason having both HDMI and DP connected causes issues
- Recent Radeon drivers v18.9ish + are doing something to cards
- my freesync AOC monitor (G2460 something) causes some electrical spikes via DP cable

I did have the exact same issue with RX480 ½ year ago, but did not send any signal out (no DP, no HDMI) on any of the 3 PCs I tested.

For both RX cards has always been intermittent no signal issues. I've usually resolved them by pulling DP and power from monitor, pressing power button on monitor to purge out all capacitors, then replugging everything. I've blamed my AOC monitor for this, but not sure of it anymore."

Auf der Rückseite ist eine wertige Back-platte vorhanden, die ein ebenso beleuchtetes Logo beinhaltet, wodurch im normalen Einbau dies direkt hervorgehoben wird. Seitlich kann man den beleuchteten Schriftzug sehen. Die Karte bietet drei DP-Anschlüsse und einmal HDMI nach 2.0b Standard, hier hätte man evtl. einen HDMI Anschluss mehr anbieten können oder auch auf 2.1 Support gehen können. Für die meisten wird es zu verkraften sein, da man meist DP verwendet.

Der Kühlblock ist sehr üppig dimensioniert, was auch am Gewicht der Karte zu erkennen ist. Dies lässt bereits auf eine starke Kühlung schließen. Die Kühlfinnen sind vertikal angeordnet, sodass die Luft im normalen Einbau Richtung Seitenpanel und Mainboard befördert wird.
Asus bietet auf der Website ein Bios für diese Karte an, dass man installieren kann.

8Kはまだ時期尚早な感じがしますが、4Kならば大体のゲームで快適にプレイ出来ます。FHDで高フレームレートを狙う場合は、CPUも重要になってくるようで、私が使用している9900Kでは3090の性能を活かし切れませんでした。ここは今後発売予定の新しいCPUに期待したいと思います。

冷却性能は最大まで負荷をかけた状態で、デフォルトの設定だと70度ぐらいまで上がります。ただソフトの方でファンの回転数を軽く上げてやれば、60度台をキープする事も可能です。ファンの音も静かなので回転数を上げてもあまり気になりません。冷却性能はかなり優秀だと思います。"

Perfect size and fit. Noiseless. Needed better graphics card for 4k editing ... so I upgraded from a R7-250/2GB on a 2014 system with gigabyte Z97 mb + i7-4970k CPU and 32gb DDR3 RAM. This brings new life to my system for far less cost than the cost of a completely new unit. Paid about $15 more for the ASUS TUF model than either a ZOTAC or Gigabyte but believe the ball bearings in its fans will more than make up the difference.

I used it on my old system with a FX 8350 cpu and 32gb of ddr3 1600 ram, Asus mobo old system was M5A97 and it was great. It wouldn't surprise me if I had installed it in my new build (Asus B450-F mobo, ddr4 ram) for a test that it would have held up quite well.

The GPU temps run idle at around 30c, and the fans are super quiet. The best part was that the card is smaller than my old ASUS STRIX GeForce GTX 970 Overclocked 4 GB, so lots more room in my mATX case.

I game on Linux Manjaro, and wish Nvidia worked with the open source community more, my only negative towards the company, not the card. Still, they do release proprietary drives to linux, and they run just as smoothly on linux as they do on Micro$oft. Love the card...buy it!!"

I had to replace a Radeon card, the card was good but the software/drivers were janky and were so fussy with various video playback that I couldn't take it. I went to this 1660 Super, for about $200 shipped and it works perfectly right out of the box, no fuss, it's a smaller card, fits in my tiny case in my living room for the HTPC/Gaming box there, so compact cards win big time there. This card is fast and cool and quiet. Drivers from nVidia these days are great, you can choose to just do the driver or the geforce experience, but HDMI scaling works perfectly even with HDCP enabled. This is why nVidia wins for me. I needed a good gaming card that doesn't make it a fuss to get good media playback (cough, Radeon software, cough). Overall great compact fast budgeting gaming 1080p GPU at the $200 price point!"

I can only go 4/5 because the current GPU market is overall overpriced. Another plus is the low power consumption of the 16 series, that can save some money in the long-term. Compared to other 16 series cards, the 1660 SUPER is clearly the best option... the 1660 Ti has minimally better performance (3-5%), and the 1660 performance is significantly lower (-10%) due to older GDDR5.

Gaming 5/5 - For 1080p, I consider the 1660 SUPER to be the sweet spot. You can easily play everything on high settings, and my guess is it will be this way for at least 2-3 more years before lowering settings is a regular necessity. 1660 SUPER is a passable option for 1440p and high framerate gaming, but 1080p is for the majority of gamers.

Noise 4/5 - The fan is audible with this TUF card, more than I've heard with previous cards I've owned (RX580, GTX470). It's not terribly loud, though... and with the low power consumption of the card, you really have to try pushing this card to get the fans revving up high.

This TUF GPU size is compact and should fit many cases. Sag shouldn't be a problem, unlike with larger cards.

I recommend the 1660 SUPER for 1080p gamers. If you're more casual and not focused on the newest games, maybe the 1650 SUPER or a used RX570-580 may be more within your budget."

It took me a long time and a bit of research to finally decide on this card, but ultimately I'm so glad I did.

This card is a beast at 1080p gaming and hasn't stuttered on anything that I've thrown at it. Overwatch, The Witcher III, Crash & Spyro Trilogy, MGSV, Batman Arkham Quadrilogy - all run buttery smooth at high graphic settings on this card coupled with a Ryzen 7 2700x. My PC runs whisper quiet with normal temps.

For the occasional gamer who's still running an older 1080p monitor, I can' t recommend this card enough."

I always believe that in a review should be about the product, because that's what we are reviewing and not the service received. That said, I was a little disappointed about the number of stickers stuck all over the box. Thankfully this doesn't affect the quality of the card.

The card is a really nice fit, and is smaller in size to what I am accustomed to. The card looks really nice, and is an ideal fit for any build as it is black in colour, so it will fit nicely in your case no matter your colour scheme. So far the card is performing pretty well, even though I haven't put it through any rigorous stress testing as yet. This I will do once the Sea Cables have been repaired and I am able to run at full performance without any other complications.

My 4 year old AMD r9 390x scored comparable to a brand new card. I'm running a zenith extreme motherboard with AMD 1950x , 64 GB ddr4 gskill , 1 tb Samsung 980 nvme... somethings wrong with this card . I'm checking through everything on my PC to make sure I didn't miss anything or need any bios update . Nope all good. The card is trash. Update . A few days after this the card must have cooked inside my PC as I smelled some burning electronics. Keep in mind my PC has 14 high pressure fans inside so I know it was not hot as my average temp was around 48c . That was usually hot inside the case because of a lot of rendering. Called Amazon for support and it was a insult talking to their rep as they told me that it must be the PC. Time to reboot it. Ok lol guess what. Tried a different setup with windows and it was the card. Next try . Amazon says we tried calling nvidia for ""help to you but they are close now"" great. I can tell I'm speaking to someone from scammer revolts YouTube now. End result. The card is dead. I'm sending it back to Amazon and I have unfortunately ordered a lower end card to replace this.

49.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,Nvidia,7000 MHz,24 GB,$24.89,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Great for Deep Learning, not gaming","This card really only makes sense to buy for one kind of person. The kind of person that needs more gpu memory. I work with huge deep learning models that even with a batch size of 1, still go over 12gb of gpu memory usage. So i was thrilled that this card was released. It is a bit disappointing to not be able to stack them together in one system due to cooling issues, but I'm happy none the less.

Please don't buy for gaming. SLI 2080ti's will work way better for the same price. And one 2080ti will give you about the same performance, but at half the price."
49.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,Nvidia,7000 MHz,24 GB,$24.89,4.5 out of 5 stars,"Great Card, not just for gaming though.","Initially I had wanted to buy two 2080 TIs as they came with 11 GB of VRAM and would be twice as fast as their 1080 counter parts. When the RTX Titan came out, the 24 GB of VRAM caught my eye and knew it was the card for me. When i got the card, it took me an hour or so to get it working with it's slower brother, the 1080, but once I started playing around, it did not disappoint.

My iray renderings come out much quicker, twice as fast as before. I'm getting double the framerate on every game i play- the card is so powerful that all games just go to maximum.

While it's a little expensive, the card performs very well, it being hooked up to two monitors while my 1080 is connected to four, giving me six total. The only major draw back on this card, which can be negated by tuning the fan profile, is the heat. I had to use third party software to crank the fans up to near maximum when the card is under full load.

Other than that, i've maxed the card out once with a single iray scene. Other than that, it's a solid buy.

EDIT/UPDATE: So I've been using this card for almost a year; games, CAD, Daz Renderings. It's a solid card at 24 GB of RAM and i've managed to max it out several times on RAM. it's a champ to say the least. I managed to render 5 different 300 DPI 6 x 9 images in 5 hours - simultaneously.

I definitely plan on getting a second card when the wallet allows. Please note the card's speed drops 200 mhz when it breaches 84 Celsius. a custom curve in MSI afterburner keeps it at 84 c or just under.

If you purchase this card- there will be a delay for funds verification. so that 2 day becomes 3 or 4. Signature required. As for gaming- it utilizes about 1/5 of it's total processing power to deliver (I cap at 60 fps)."

49.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,Nvidia,7000 MHz,24 GB,$24.89,4.5 out of 5 stars,Great Performance; Very Expensive,"Hands down a powerful beast for a consumer card. Handles pretty much anything thrown at in like a champ. The 24GB VRAM helps a lot for rendering and high use applications (of which I almost exceeded at one point). There is some coil whine when under heavy stress, but I noticed it actually got quieter the more I used it. Fans are decently quiet and you can keep it under 84C it in most applications. Price tag is mighty hefty and is definitely overprice by at least $500, but the performance is there."
49.0,NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card,NVIDIA Corporation,Nvidia,7000 MHz,24 GB,$24.89,4.5 out of 5 stars,I like the NVIDIA Titan RTX Graphics Card.,"I hope to purchase a second soon, if I need it. I am using this card on both Windows 10 and Intel Clear Linux OS, and using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers on both. Intention is to code both for machine learning and RTX. I have tested it lightly on some games, and it appears to be an impressive improvement over my older model 1080 Ti. I did not buy the Titan RTX primarily for gaming. My rating for value for money is not scientific, but a seat-of-the-pants feeling, for how it cmpares to my 1080 TI experience. This is an expensive card with lots of memory that is useful for neural networks and compute shader algorithms, but it is an entry-level platform in this respect. You can double this with two Titan RTX, for 48 GB, but before you think that is a lot, look at the NVIDIA site for full-on solutions that cost much more. One thing to consider is that the twin blower fans pull air from one side, and exhaust top and bottom through a heat sink running the length of the card--these do not exhaust out of the backplane like a commodity gaming rig does, they exhaust internally on most cases. This means that you need to consider your chassis cooling design differently, especially if you plan to use two cards. I like the design, it is actually more flexible. Use an appropriate chassis, maybe not your old GForce GTX chassis. My ambient room temperature is 75 F degrees, and I have six fans exhausting from a 6U case with lots of room around my single card, which is on a Thermaltake 16x riser. The card is cool to the touch while writing this review, and warm for the 3D I have tried so far. Hope this helps someone, ok, now I must get back to work!"

No game manufacturer is going to waste time targeting this card's resources.

This card is for deep learning and maybe other sci/tech applications. It's not even good value for mining crypto. Almost the only reason to get this card is to fit a large model (probably a neural net) into its spacious 24GB of vram, and for that purpose it works fine.

Don't think of it as an RTX card. Don't think of it as a Titan card. Think of it as a Quadro 6000 with the 64-bit flops disabled. Because that's what it is."

I swapped my healthy and working 1080 ti for this and you can configure your work to make use of the extra memory to increase your batch size with great reduction on your total training time and if you use software that uses the special 576 tensor cores this card is more than double the power than 1080ti when used for ai

Motherboard: ASUS Sabertooth 990FX
CPU: AMD FX-4100 Zambezi 3.6GHz (3.8GHz Turbo) Socket AM3+ 95W Quad-Core Desktop Processor FD4100WMGUSBX
Graphics card: EVGA 01G-P3-1561-AR GeForce GTX 560 Ti
RAM: CORSAIR Vengeance 16GB (4 x 4GB) Model CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9
Power Supply: CORSAIR Enthusiast Series TX750 V2 750W
Case: Rosewill CHALLENGER
Optical Drive: ASUS Black SATA Model DRW-24B1ST/BLK/B/AS - OEM
Monitor: Acer S231HLbid Black 23"" 5ms HDMI LED-Backlight LCD monitor Slim Design

All in all they work amazingly together. It runs Rift and WOW really well with all the settings maxed out. Just to test its capabilities, I opened 3 or 4 windows in Google Chrome, had Itunes playing music, Excel and Word both open, 3ds Max running, Adobe Flash CS5 running, and had Rift running on max settings and I still got well over 25 fps on a crowded shard and the computer didn't lag or crash. Hopefully that helps."

What I was worried about was that EVGA (first time customer) would provide quality on par with the GPU.

I have been using this card for over a month now and everything just runs smoothly. I like how this card comsumes less power than the GTX 280 I had before, all while delivering even better performance.

Only complaint is about the mini-HDMI connector, you must carry the adapter around because nobody will really have one and it's just plain silly to put a connector that nobody truly uses, and it's not like a full HDMI port wouldn't fit (as in smartphones). There's plenty of space. I'm guessing it's the ugly DisplayPort's fault, and nVidia for that matter.

I found EVGA's PrecisionX software to be really good and reliable (not like other manufacturer's bloatware).

Oh! I almost forgot! This card can totally bitstream Dolby TrueHD and DTS-MA, I tried it myself. 1,000+ extra points for that!

Conclusion: nVidia is awesome, EVGA is awesome too, I hate DisplayPort (don't worry, it's personal)"

My last ""high-end"" GPU was a 9500GT that was never used for games. I heard about BF3 and was sold after seeing the trailer. I bought this card, and a G500 mouse, all for BF3. WOW! The card is great, the details are amazing. I am getting around 60FPS on 4 gigs of ram and q9550, running win7 64bit at High settings (not oc'ed). If you're not a hardcore gamer then I think this card will definitely be sufficient. I'm haven't tested this card on other games but I assume it would perform well since BF3 is very graphic intense.

The only negative thing I can say about this card is the drivers. Others have experienced the occasional crash of the drivers. However, recently a new version of the drivers was release and I haven't encountered a crash since the update.

To sum it up, this card is for the occasional gamer that cannot distinguish 1080p and 980p."

That's where the positives end. Compared to the RX 580 (at $185) this card is a rip-off in the FPS/$$$ department. Team Red's 580 matches the performance of the 1660, yet it costs $35 LESS. For the cost-difference in comparable GPUs, the GDDR5 1660 is a waste of your money. After owning both the 1660 and the 1660 Ti, paired with a 9400F, I can say for certain, that if you MUST HAVE NVIDIA, get the Ti. For the $60 higher cost, you get about 30% higher performance AND it can even play games on high setting at 4K very comfortably. IF YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT NVIDIA, go with the RX 580 at this performance margin and save $35 for the SAME PERFORMANCE.

This 1660 is a waste of your money. NVIDIA should be ashamed of this card."

This gave me a reason to upgrade, and I found 1060 to be the current best ""bang-for-the-buck"". I just wish the video card market was better now (I really don't like cryptominers).

This is the first time I purchased a card from with the ZOTAC brand. Once I chose the 1060, I based the purchase of this brand on the price and size of the card. I'm very happy with it. It works perfect with DP connections to dual 1440p monitors. I noticed that both monitors now show up as audio devices too, and it works, but the monitor audio is not very good, which is to be expected. I think I'll stick to my external DAC/AMP with headphones, but I thought that was cool.

The fan is quiet when not under load, but does get louder, but not super loud, when under extreme load. The only thing left to do is test how long it lasts. I'll update this review if I have any issues."

Works great with Ubuntu 18.04,"I needed a decent card to drive my 27” 4K display on my Ubuntu Linux system while working from home that would also give me decent FPS in Steam (and would be delivered in a reasonable amount of time). Against my better judgement, I’d tried a Radeon-based card beforehand and it was an incompatible nightmare.

There are cheaper cards out there, but the ZOTAK had the GPU I wanted and a lot more RAM than some of the other options.

Installation was overall pretty simple. Pull the old card, drop in the new one and hook up the PCIE power cable. I highly recommend that you use at least a 650 or 750 watt supply. I had a Corsair 750 watt supply on my parts shelf that I installed at the same time and when I fired the system up, I was impressed that I didn’t hear a lot of fan noise.

I like to use the official Nvidia drivers since they usually have better management utilities and better performance. After setting the system to use the “multi-user.target”, I followed their installation procedure to blacklist the nouveau kernel modules and installed their drivers.

After rebooting, the system went back to the default “graphical.target” and things just worked from there on.

I did some testing with Kerbel on Steam and the display was crisp, clean and had a decent frame rate. I didn’t notice any extra fan noise and verified that the card continued to run cool. The two large fans do a nice job moving air while making minimal noise.

Overall, I’m pretty impressed with the card. It gives a reasonable balance between price and performance and has been trouble free so far.."

I was originally shopping for a 1050/1050Ti but when I finally got around to buying one I decided to go with the 1060 and just pay an extra 50 bucks. It was VERY worth it. The performance on the 1060 (not event he Ti) really just doesn't even compare to even the 1050Ti and its only a bit more expensive. Like all PC gamers I'm still fuming over the prices of GPUs due to (it almost makes me vomit trying to say it) ""Miners"" so that is a MAJOR downside because no one should have to pay this much for a video card these days. Anyways most things about this card are good so I'm not going to list them all but the main ones is that it was easy to install and get into my PC and I've had no issues with it since my first use about 6 months ago now. Some downsides is that it runs hot so just be careful with that and the 3GB model is somewhat lacking on performance. So if you're looking for a bit better performance when running games I would grab the 6GB model or the Ti (they might be the same idk). Defiantly get this instead if you're looking at a 1050 because I would still consider this a 'budget' card but it just runs way better than a 1050 ever did. BUT if you wan't serious performance it's not even a competition the 1070/Ti/1080/Ti are WAYYYY better especially if you're looking into streaming. Zotac makes them very well and I'm very happy with it but I have to say EVGA is probably the better manufacturer as they don't run quite as hot."

This is an amazing GPU. I never used ZONTAC before, always bought MSI for my products on my PC. But I had to replace a 1060 that lasted 3 years (founders) and for the pricing this seemed like a perfect fit, while slightly upgrading my system for a tight budged. I must admit, compared to my MSI founders 1060GTX this is a lot noisier, but not by much. Since its a smaller form factor that my HUGE 1060 (which had 2 fans), this one is considerable smaller (half the size) and only 1 fan, so it has to work a little harder to cool of the card.

Besides that, installation was basic, plug and play basically. Download the nvidia drivers and you are good to go. I play mostly MMOs, like Black Desert Online, Tera, GW2, and I run all at max graphics. Also aRPG like Pathfinder: Kingmaker, D:OS2, and Pillars of Eternity 2. Also at max graphics. Again this is no 1080 or 2080 card, this will run perfect at 30 fps to 45 fps most high demanding games, but try to push it and it will stagger. Keep in mind a good amount of RAM is needed for many games; so if you are having problems it may be because of RAM available on your system.

I'm posting this review to give people a heads up. It's a much cooler running card and it is mostly silent. The installation requires an 8pin while my first card was 6. Fortunately Dell has an innovative little attachment that lets you add 2 more.

It was the Nvida software that held me up. Not being a fan of that 'Experience' I just wanted the drivers and after downloading the game ready drivers it kept telling me it couldn't install in my version of windows10. Which was a first for me. Ultimately I was able to install the 'studio' drivers by installing on a peripheral drive. The card itself can now play games like Red Dead Redemption at Ultimate settings without a hitch. For around $200 as a gaming card it seems like a solid purchase and something to hold you over for a couple of tech cycles."

To be honest you can get a used 1070 for roughly the same price (or possibly even cheaper) and the 1070 will give better performance and more ram, but if you want a warrenty and piece of mind of a newer video card, I highly suggest this.

For streamers, I can't say enough about how awesome the new turing NVENC is. I used to use my 5960x on X264 Medium for a 1080/60fps 6000bit rate stream. Those settings normally hit the pc at about 60% usage. Now on High Quality NVENC (version2) at 6000 bit rate at 1080/60fps, my cpu usage is always sub 3%. Even though I don't game on the 5960x, I've found the nvenc streaming literally perfect. People have said my stream quality is top notch. I can't suggest it enough to those interested."

I graduated from the dinky upHere bracket and this is, no doubt, a million times better than that one.

I use the Lian Li O11 Dynamic case and the screws are compatible with it. Due to the thickness of the bracket, once you tighten the screws, it’ll automatically straighten itself. All you need to do, then, is to adjust the small portion of the bracket. Adjust until your GPU is level and tighten the screws using the provided Allen key.

Unfortunately, the screws that attach the bracket to the case are not black. It doesn’t affect the quality whatsoever so that’s just me nitpicking."

There's a lot of wiggle-room for placement, height...etc. and it actually props up the GPU (whereas a lot of other braces look to only limit sag). I'm happy with the purchase and not worried about an off-kilter GPU anymore.

It took me some time (more than anticipated) to install, mainly because I forgot to factor in my PCIe wifi adapter. So it took me a little trial & error to figure out how the right combo of positioning to get everything to fit right. An unexpected bonus of this brace is that it kind of obscures the wifi card. I have an ATX mobo, I think smaller ones might struggle more w placement and may suffer from some connector obstruction...but there are a lot of ways to fudge around w positioning/height so maybe not! I included a pic of brace/support in my case (excuse the terrible photo quality, my PC is the only place where good graphics happen lol).

The main thing to note (IMO) is that the support may interfere with your GPU fans. This is probably GPU-dependent, but mine (ASUS ROG STRIX 2080 super...etc.) has 3 fans and they cover most of the front-face. Regardless of where I positioned the support along the brace, the padding on the top of the support (where your GPU should rest) extended into the path of 1 fan. I remedied this by trimming the padding on the sides (basically, I turned the rectangle of padding into an isosceles triangle lol) AND by manually reposition the brace once the case was upright (literally just moving it so it's straight/as close to the GPU edge as possible). I included 2 pics that do a somewhat terrible job of showing the current set-up wrt support & fan space. I tested it out a bunch to make sure the fans weren't hitting the support/padding, and I didn't/don't hear or see any friction. So far, no friction/detritus fires! And no notable effect on case temps, so it doesn't seem to be obstructing air flow either."

That's it; no booklet and no drivers.

The card is sold as low profile but comes with the full height bracket installed, secured on the card with three bolts. See the three green lines in the attached image. The two are the bolts holding the DVI connector. The third is covered by the fan shroud?!

Contacted the 888 number on the box. Reasonable wait; under 8 minutes. First guy insisted the full height bracket was held in place only by the two DVI bolts. When I told him, I was disappointed with the lack of product knowledge, he said I had an attitude and kicked me to the attitude queue.

After another 8 minute wait, I was told that indeed the third bolt can be removed only by removing the shroud assembly of the cooling fan. This required removal of the four bolts mating the fan assembly with the card. See the four red lines in the attached image.

The shroud removal also forces you to separate the heat conductive surfaces from the chip to the fan. DO NOT WIPE the grease between the two.

Was able to put it all together.

Even if there are no heat conduction problems and the card's performance is just about where a 2 GB GDDR5 GT1030 ought to be, I am disappointed with the design and the attitude of the first customer service person.

It was ridiculously easy and I see no reason to complain about it even slightly. Just use a smaller Phillips screwdriver and unscrew it...it's like 3 turns or so. Tiny screw.

You also need (I recommend) needle nose pliers to unscrew the bolts around the DVI port. After that the full length bracket comes off, and you put the low profile one on. It only uses the bolts from the DVI port to hold it on - so you don't even have to put the screw back in after that is apparently so hard to take out for some.

The DVI port is Single-Link as well and I'm just using QHD and 4k monitors these days. The power consumption is only 30 watts and I'd guess that my setup uses a lot less than that. I was able to hook up the second monitor using a GoFanco USB to QHD HDMI device.

It's a quality card and is far superior to the two prior cards I had previously mounted in my old Dell 980 (EVGA Nvidia GT 610 and GT 630).

I purchased the GT 1030 card because I wanted to eliminate the digital breakup I was experiencing whenever I streamed movies. But once it arrived I ran into a big problem. It would not fit into the mounting slot on my PC. Why? Because the heat sink for the CPU and the PS2 connection box were getting in the way. However, after studying the problem for a while I realized that if I modified the plastic casing on the card I could get it to fit.

Luckily, this card was a return that I purchased from Amazon at a great price. So, I decided it was worth the gamble, knowing full well that if something went wrong I wasn't going to be able to return it.

(Please note, this modification will void the warranty for the EVGA Nvidia GT 1030 — do it at your own risk.)

HOW I MODIFIED THIS CARD TO FIT MY DELL OPTIPLEX 980 MT

I knew this video card would work in my Dell 980 Optiplex MT, but I had a problem, the plastic case covering for the card kept it from fitting in the mounting slot.

The head of the card would not fit because of the PS2 connection box on the motherboard. On the other end, I had a similar problem where it was striking the heat sink for the PC's CPU. My solution? Modify the plastic casing on the video card by cutting it and the card's heat sink aluminum blades.

How do you do the modification?

First, you need to remove the four screws that hold the plastic casing to the GT 1030. They are located on the backside of the card (see pictures). Once you remove them, the case will come loose except for the power connector for the fan. Be careful with the fan's power plug, it's hard to disconnect from the card but can be done if you use a jeweler's slotted screw driver to release it from the mount by pushing on the plastic spring holding it in place. Once it's disconnected, you are free to work on the case.

You now need to remove the seven screws that hold the fan and the heat sink to the casing. With the plastic case released from the fan and heat sink, you can cut the case in two places removing about two inches of the plastic on each end (see pictures). I used a fine toothed hacksaw to cut the plastic case. I then used a Dremel (rotary tool) with a cutting disc to shorten the heat sink's aluminum blades on the back end by about 1 1/2 inches. Cosmetically, the card won't look so hot, but the important thing once reassembled it will fit.

Reassemble everything in reverse order and then mount the modified case and heat sink back to the card. Once everything is back together mount it in your PC, boot up your computer and update the drivers. Windows automatically updated the drivers to version: 23.21.13.9135 dated: 3/23/2018. I also downloaded and tried the latest drivers from Nvidia, but they caused problems so I just stayed with the ones I had.

Important Note:
1. The bottom of the aluminum heat sink has ""thermal heat sink compound."" You'll need to have some just in case you accidentally remove it as you do the modification. It's available here on Amazon. It's cheap. When I did this modification, I decided the easiest think to do was to remove the compound and replace it afterwards during the reassembly process. Thermal heat sink compound is used to transfer heat from video card's CPU to the aluminum heat sink where the heat is dissipated and cooled by the internal fan.

2. The 7 screws you remove from the fan and plastic casing are tiny. You will need a jeweler's set of screw drivers in order to remove them. Also, be careful not to lose them as they will easily roll off your work surface.

3. The power plug for the fan is difficult to disconnect from the card — be careful when you pry on the tiny plastic spring. If you exert too much force on the connection point you can damage the mounting slot on the card.

The GT 1030 has been in my PC for almost a week now and it's working flawlessly. I'll try update this review in six months."

It had served me well at the time, but over time, I found an increasing number of video games that I wanted to play that it wasn't capable of running. I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to a new video card this year. After a very long search for a video card that was superior to the 740, but that still cost under $100, I decided on this GT 1030.

I used websites such as GameDebate and PCGameBenchMark to help me make sure that it would run the games I like best. This is highly recommended because it saves a ton of time over searching for sites about each individual game to read the system requirements.

Will it run the very latest games that just came out? Not all of them, but it will run a few of the ones I'm interested in. For example, it'll run Valorant and Fortnite, even on recommended settings, which came out very recently. It'll run almost anything made before 2018 except for notoriously high system requirement games like the Far Cry series (which it can kinda handle on low settings). Most of the games I enjoy the most are older games anyway, so this is a good choice for me.

The card itself is surprisingly small for something that's more capable than the bigger GT 740. It is thinner and a little shorter than the GT 740. It also doesn't need you to plug in a power cable into the end of the card itself as it is more energy efficient and gets all the power it needs through the PCI express slot provided that you have a good enough power supply. You need at least a 300 Watt power supply for it. I have a 650 watt PSU, which is more than enough.

The small size gives it more room for air flow in most cases. Some video cards today are so huge that they'll barely fit, even in a big ATX mid-tower case. This card has plenty of room in my Antec Nine Hundred case (which is excellent by the way, if you can still find one). This video card only takes up one slot on the motherboard, so if you want to install another card such as a sound card, in a PCI slot near the video card, there's plenty of room for it.

The GT 1030 runs very quietly and coolly. It doesn't increase the fan noise of my computer at all. I use Piriform's Speccy program to monitor my PC and even when I've been playing a graphics intensive game like Diablo III for an hour or two, this card isn't even close to exceeding its maximum temperature threshold of 96 degrees C.

It sports two DVI ports which let you hook up monitors and display at up to 7680×4320@60Hz resolution. I use it on twin Acer K202 HQL monitors running at 1600 x 900 @60 Hz resolution with no problems. Just be sure to get DVI cables with narrow frames around their plugs. If you can't find one that has narrow enough plugs, you can trim off the plastic frame on either side of the actual metal male DVI plug to make room without damaging the cable.

It's not the prettiest video card I've ever seen, but it is quite capable for the price range and is a great choice for computer cases that are not very roomy."

Aside all things below, this card started to glitch (complete loss of output signal) more often and more severe. Goes off and stays that way. have to hard-reset the computer for the screen to come back up. Oddly, this happens only when watching Amazon Prime movies...

Well, it seems to work well. Running ECO, Minecraft, Fortnight, near max settings at near 100 FPS. Doom, Counter Strike, Quake and such on maximum settings, no issues.
(added on 3/12/2020 - Several times since been installed, when starting Amazon Movies, the video completely drops out and get the fuzzy screen. The first two times it came back up after about a minute, but last time this happened I ended up having to Force-Reboot the PC to get anything to show up. This never happened with my old card. Everything else seems to work just fine!)
Installation of hardware was difficult. It came with full size bracket attached and I have a low-profile setup so swapping for the low-profile bracket is difficult because the it requires the fan cover removal, which is attached to the heatsink, so that had to come off. So 7 screws later and risking damage to the electronics it was done.
Had to permanently remove the fan cover as it adds too much to the thickness of the card and would not fit in my small tower.

Now, this GPU is much better than my old gt 635. I can play every game I have at 60fps@760p, TV limited. It's great when it works.

The bad: sometimes when I start my computer after work it will not recognize the GPU is installed. It has picture, but it doesn't come up in any benchmark programs or task manager. Some games will say GPU not detected. I may have to restart several times before it will recognize the GPU is installed.

I'll usually shut the computer down and reseat the GPU, but that doesn't always work. After testing the first time this happened, I used my old GPU and it came up right away, every time. I'm not sure what the issue may be, but it doesn't seem to be related to my motherboard. I've never had or heard of this problem before that wasn't solved by simply reseating the GPU.

If it continues to happen, I'll probably start a return on it."

It started out life, about 6 years ago as a very low end office PC , it's an HP 6305 SFF that came with an A4-5300B, 4GB RAM (single channel), and a 500 HDD. I intially upgraded the CPU to an A8-5500, added another stick of RAM (8GB dual channel), and a low profile Radeon 6570 so I could mess around with AMD's ill-fated Dual Graphics (APU + discrete GPU) tech. That setup served me well, it did everything I needed to do, and could even handle some light gaming. Given the age of the unit, I figured I was due for a replacement sooner rather than later, but unfortunately, I was informed that desktop replacements were not coming for the foreseeable future, and what we got is what we're going to have for a while now. Another round of upgrades were in order. I considered the RX 550, but the low profile models were $30 more than the GT 1030 and it's performance is about the same, a low profile GTX 1050, which was significantly faster, but nearly double the price, and the RX 560 which was also more expensive (and faster) but whose power draw made me nervous (60-80 TDP against a 240 watt PSU). So the 1030 GT it was, very low power draw, and a big performance upgrade over the old 6570. I also added an SSD, along with another 8GB (2x4GB) of RAM from some discarded desktops and now I've taken this thing about as far as it can go for the most part. The GT 1030 is about as fast as old GTX 460, which isn't much by today's standards, but it handles most older games and Source-based games just fine, even at 1080p.

Installation is like any other card. Card is quite big so make sure to measure your case to make sure it can hold it. For me the card while playing games like the new Modern Warfare I average 130fps on max setting with a Ryzen 5 3600 cpu. Tempatures are great while under load. Haven’t seen the temp go above 65c very often.

Card stays cool and runs quite. RGB is a plus as it pairs perfect with my Asus ROG Strix B350F motherboard."

With so many different variations it's hard to choose one! So here it is, straight and simple. I had narrowed down my choices between two, the MSI GTX1070 and the ASUS GeForce ROD STRIX OC. Now I am not a benchmarker, so if you are looking for someone who will tell you the in depth details of the temperature, and the clock speeds scroll along. However, here is what happened. My buddy Purchased the MSI, I purched this one. They Run identical. noise level is the same, however the only thing that stood out the most is the rear connectors are different as mine has two HDMI and the MSI only one. AND the Geforce is alot bigger. Those Three fans give it some definite girth, so be prepared. Other than that, From a casual gamer who just wanted an upgrade, this card kills everything I throw at it on max graphics.

My Games tested on max are:
Arma III
The Witcher 3
Star Citizen (The only game to truly test this card and doesnt let it go MAX everything)
Skyrim
Total War"

This card ran perfect out of the box, I can run all my games in ultra in 1080p. the LED lighting is annoying in my opinion, i bought this card on a performance base, im glad i went with this over the gigabit OC version. Asus out did themselves. it runs the new tomb raider, gears of war 4, and ARMA, in perfect quality. my FPS doesn't drop down under 60 now. i upgraded from a crossfired AMD 6970s, and jeez, im impressed. this one takes the cake, worth the extra money. id write a full review, but there's enough yu can look at. doesn't get hotter than 65C, the fans work perfect, the GPU tweak is okay, MSI is better i think. the gpu tweak WONT SAVE MY DAMN FAN SPEED SETTINGS, so i go with msi, the gpu tweak looks, runs a lot better. but MSI saves my s***.

unless you have a 1080, just buy it. plug it in, bump your stuff to ultra, and enjoy. im not useing a high quality monitor, so i cant say for its FPS in 1440p or 4K, but for 1080, it works more than well."

Let me just say I'm glad I didn't fold and buy other cards. MSI, Gigabyte, EVGA I've heard most have poor QA and some of the parts feel cheap and or not worth the price.
It is the total opposite with this Asus 1070. As soon as you take the card out of the box it feels RIGHT. From the cooler, to the backplate, RGB lighting with the custom Tweak 2/AURA tools included this card is a beast. I must've spent a good 20 minutes just playing with the colors.

Pros:
RGB lighting
Tweak 2/AURA tools
Custom cooler
Overall design and backplate
Competitively priced(Got mine for 439.99$)
Best OC 1070 out there as of right now.
Cons:
Size(very large, need a big case for this(current 900D)
Drivers need install from Nvidia website as soon as its installed(1070 didn't show up in my system until I did)
Out of the box, the fans don't turn on until a certain heat temp is reached 30C I believe it was (I thought mine was defective until I used Tweak tool)"

I was really struggling to play Playerunknown's Battlegrounds on my GTX 770. I have an i5 3750k overclocked to 4.0mhz and 16gb or ram, but PUB bought my system to its knees. I ran the Valley benchmark before the upgrade. With my GTX 770, I scored 1450. Then I slapped this bad boy in and did a clean driver installation. Wow! 3650 points on the Valley benchmark! So don't let anyone tell you ""U r gunna bottlenek ur CPU!"" This card is massive upgrade!

In Battlegrounds I averaged 30-55 frames per second on low settings with my old GTX 770
With this GTX 1070 I can run the game on high settings and never dip below 60 frames per second.

Pros.
Its a beast
Its quiet
Its total overkill for 1080p gaming (and I like overkill)

Cons.
None that I can think of. I was expecting a performance boost compared to my old graphics card. What I got was a card three times more powerful than my old card, so you'll have to forgive me if I can't find anything to complain about."

Updating the bios was easy as downloading it and double-clicking. No issues. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that (in windows 10) gamma/color settings don't load automatically, and I have to open the app everytime I boot up. Settings are saved, but don't load for some reason. (Install was from a safe mode-- uninstall an older GTX 960 & install drivers/app for the 1070.) Once I get into a game though, it's been able to handle everything I've thrown at it with just default OC. Really nice!"

Playing Civ V had become torture. Once a fair portion of the map was open, it literally took minutes for the a turn to end. Trying to play Civ VI was just plain insane as it was crawling from the start. Now movies play without any problems and in Civ V, even playing a huge map the turns end quickly as there is NO video delays. This card is proving to be a god send. Love it!

Temps don't go above 45C when under load and using the bundled software to overclock. I will point out however, that a portion of the price is really for the RGB and ASUS ROG branding. If you're seriously into overclocking, you will be better served looking for a cheaper GPU that is also binned and watercooling that. For people who just want to plug and play or aren't familiar with manual overclocking this is a good GPU.

Also, the RGB lights can be turned off or changed. No, the Aura software isn't feature packed, it's very basic. No, there is no zone lighting. Yes, you'll have to change the speed with the GPU Tweak II software if you want to use presets or manually overclock. The default, however, is the gaming mode which is plenty fast.

I don't play a lot of pc games, and mostly open world games. This card can handle 1440p on ultra on most games. The card stays cool, so far only maxing at about 65 degrees for me. It stays silent up to 55 degree, but even when the fan starts to kick in, it's still decently quiet. I'm super sensitive to fan noise, and these don't really bother me. The one concern I have, and this applies to all nvidia cards, is that if you're using 3 or more monitors then this card idles at 55+ degree and clocks at about 1000 MHz, causing the fans to kick on. The Strix has 2 additional pwm fan connections so I put a fan under it and set it to always be on helping with the idle temp a bit. It's also a beef card so it'll sag a bit."

I can play all of my games on high-ultra settings with no problems. Aesthetically, the card has lots of RGB that works well with my ASUS motherboard. Highly recommend if you’re not wanting to spend a ton of money on a GPU.

My only complaint is that this card has really bad coil whine when playing games. Not a big deal though because my headset filters out the noise anyway.

My next investment will probably be a GPU support bracket as this thing is massive and sags a good bit."

Satisfied with my upgrade choice,"After saving up and holding out for the past two years I finally saved enough to upgrade from a potato PC to a new rig.

My new build features this GTX 1660 and a Ryzen 2600 and a B450 motherboard.

I'm able to play all my games at 60+ FPS on ultra settings with my 1080p monitor. Turning down graphics to medium/high with flashy graphics off I'm able to hit 100+ FPS in some games. I'm fine with 60FPS ultra because I currently do not have a good monitor. So far I am very satisfied with this graphics card. it looks amazing with a black/gray color design. The RGB is a little extra and I really do like the backplate for this card. This is one of the pricer GTX 1660 but MSI has proven to be worth the extra $20 with their design and cooling. Hopefully I do not have any issues to report. For now this is definitely a nice upgrade from my old GTX 750 Ti.

I saw no design to go for a RTX 2060 because I did not see myself using the Ray Tracing feature. If you're looking to upgrade from a old video card this is definitely worth considering.

PS - If you're playing APEX LEGENDS this card will handle it without a problem :)"

Went to the manufacturers website to obtain the driver and I did but It did't recognize my version of windows when I attempted to install it. Scoured the web for solutions but finally realized my version of windows needed to be updated by going to Microsofts website because windows update apparently doesn't update the operating system but just applied basic fixes.

This went into an older Intel DQ77MK motherboard with a Gen 4 core I7 processor, raided SSDs for the OS and raided mechanical drives for data. It replaces a Nvidia GTX 650.
This card barely fits the motherboard but it did fit.

I had to change the SATA cable for the 5th connector from straight to 90 degrees at the mother board because the end of the card falls over the connector. There will be no replacing of motherboard memory without taking the card out as the card sits flush against end of the memory sockets with them locked in, no room to swivel the locks.

I also replaced the power supply, as this card requires an 8 pin VGA connector and the old PS only had a 6 pin. The old PS has quite a few miles on it and the odds are that electrolytic capacitors will eventually become problematic, so I didn't mind springing for a new supply.

The change in performance is very noticeable, streaming video is smoother, pages and photos pop faster, the fans are nicely quiet. Based on the Passmark comparisons with more expensive cards, I would agree with other comments that this card may be one of the best at Bang for the Buck.

Mileage will vary if the software will work for your system. I have another system that is an MSI, and it works well.

As a result, I had to switch to USB Wi-Fi and reinstall the OS as uninstalling the software doesn't fix the Wi-Fi issue. This time, I just defaulted the RGB to stock settings. Once my PC install all the updates, Wi-Fi works again.

Switched back and forth a few times with same results. Turns out, many modern GPUs require the newer (2012 and later) UEFI BIOS to function, and the Dell BIOS was last updated 2011. Nvidia the support said last GPUs supporting legacy BIOS was the GTX 700 series. So sent it back and will hobble through with the old R9 270 until I can build a new PC."

I am by no means an expert, but I did my research and found that the 1070 was probably best suited for my needs, and having used several EVGA components in the past I decided to stick with what I felt was the best.

I am so glad I did.

For starters, I built my daily driver PC roughly 1.5 years ago and it started life with an EVGA 750 SC TI. For what I was doing at the time it worked well. It handled most games I played in the medium to high range with some settings adjusted, and I thought I would be happy. I thought wrong. The FTW2 model I purchased was and is as the kids put it eloquently ""Off the chain"". Now, all current games I play are ultra settings, and it just churns out those precious FPS. I paired it with an i7 4790k and it works like buttered toast. Wait tastes like buttered toast. no... erm.. Its just great.

Installation was a breeze, although I did end up pulling my system apart to clean and perform some wire management. This card is long, so make sure you check specs and measure before you purchase so you aren't stuck needing to buy a new case or move other peripherals around. I only had to move my HDD to fit it. It does require two (2) eight (8) pin power connectors, so make sure you have those available. I currently use a fully modular 650watt PS from EVGA, and it works just fine.

Running the card was as easy as booting my system, ensuring settings in BIOS read everything correctly and then booting to windows. I found on initital startup the login screen was not nearly as harsh on the reds. Don't know why it changed, but it changed for the better. Currently I am running three monitors with this setup and configuration was already set. I downloaded the precisionOC from EVGA (protip: make sure you have your cards serial number ready, as its needed to download) and fired it up. The interface is clean, with each item able to be hovered over with the mouse for a small description of that item. I have not messed with the overclock functions yet, but it is as easy as moving some sliders around and letting her rip ( did I just assume your GPUS gender?!?!)

I am super super happy with this card, and feel pretty confident that I won't have to upgrade any time soon (we all say that, right?)."

I have it in one of my secondary computers now which I am giving to my nephew. It still can run new games in 1080p at high to ultra settings. I have a 2080ti in my main computer now, but if you can wait for the RTX 3080 to be more available, do it because it retails for 700 and is way better than the 2080ti. But if you are cool with 1080p, you can still stick with this GTX1070 for a while.

I spend a lot of time building/fixing desktop PCs. I have several I have built that I use at home, and at work. It has been a hobby since about 1994. I used to surrender to the urge of getting the very best component you could possibly get when building a PC or whatever electronic system. And if that is what you want, there is nothing wrong with that. But in the last few years, I have made it a goal to make the best desktop PCs for workstation, and gaming at the lowest possible price. This card is amazing for how cheap it is (yes 380 dollars plus tax is cheap). I spent $400 on a card back in 2006/2007 just on the cusp of AGP going out and PCI-E coming in, and that wasn't even as much as I could have spent back then.
The processor in the card is pretty decent. It can run the best games at high graphics (and with 8gb of ram it has no issues there). Where you may run into trouble is if you want to play the latest game at high frame rates on ultra graphics... say you have a 144hz 1440p monitor and want to sync the FPS with the refresh rate... I don't think that will happen for you at that high of a refresh... so if ultra frames are important to you (if you are a competitive gamer playing in tournaments or even just for fun against others) that may be more important to you... but for most gamers I do not believe it is.
In this range of cards, the 1070 is in a sweet spot. So unless you plan on spending 1000 or more, this card is the best for the price in this range."

While it's not totally necessary as of this writing, future proofing your system when you can afford it is always a good idea. The SC2 is totally identical to the SC in clock speeds. The difference is the cooler referred to as ICX. EVGA has effectively rectified the issues that some SC and FTW cards (ACX) had with lack of thermal pads and overheating with this card. The FTW2 card also has the ICX cooler upgrade. Onto the performance itself, this bad boy has run everything I have thrown at it without a single hitch. I mainly play Overwatch, CS:GO, BF1, LoL, Prey, Dishonored 2, and Gears of War 4. I'm sticking with 1080p for PC gaming in the long run, making the 1070 perfect for me. Anything greater for 1080p is considered a waste a money. Overall, very highly recommended!

Quite the upgrade! Firstly, this is the biggest card I've ever had, I had to squeeze it in my Lanboy modular tower which is a full size tower. There wasn't any room to spare after install, so keep that in mind when buying. Once in and all hooked up, the RGB lights come right on with a customizable interface for different effects and colors. I really like the look, and they are bright enough.

On to game play: (I play on a 32"" 1440p monitor 144hz) Star Wars The Old Republic can be run on ultra with 100 - 175 fps depending on environment.
DCS World 2 on Ultra 55 - 100 fps. On the 1050 SSC I could barely play the game on medium / low settings without it lagging out on a smaller low res monitor.

The card is louder and warmer than my 1050 ssc was but nothing too bad and is expected with the big performance jump. I could probably get even better performance if I upgraded my old Crosshair Formula V mobo and AMD 8320 cpu. Also running 16gb of Corsair ram 2400mhz for reference.

Side note, this card goes on sale at times and I snatched one for $399.99."

This is a great card and generally evga has a great reputation. However, evga did not initially install necessary thermal pads as laid out in nvidia's specification which led to serious overheating issues that could potential damage your gpu. EVGA offers free services to fix the card, but you have install the thermal pads yourself. A decent solution for those who already bought and installed their card, but I will not do that on a brand new card.

Cards sold after Nov 1 are supposed have this issue fixed. I purchased my card on 1/11/17 from amazon and upon registering the serial # I found my card contained the defect. Its absolutely unacceptable of amazon to continue selling defective versions of this product. There are reports of the card catching fire. If you plan on buying this card, do so from another website. Or buy a different manufacturer's version."

I don't understand why EVGA doesn't active these LEDs from the factory. I thought my 1070 doesn't have this function until I figured this out."

Only switched because a SC Hybrid 1070ti went on sale and its a way better deal than this one is.

In terms of performance, I was doing some minor gaming while I was setting up my new PC and testing mods in FO4. 1080p on ultra. Unlocked FPS ranged from 99 lowest to 150 outdoors and about 200-300 indoors. Temps seem to not be too bad, average after about 30-40 min gaming session was about 65c.

That's the card review. Now the horrible part.

First, there's no included software, you have to go to EVGA to download the drivers but other than that nothing as far as I can tell. The box contained the GPU, a sticker, and a pamphlet showing off utilities that aren't compatible with the card.

Second and most annoyingly, when I ordered this I saw that little ""notification"" telling me that amazon will share my contact info with 3rd party companies and more or less ignored it since I assumed it wouldn't be anything too bad.

I don't have much time for games, but I've been playing Grim Dawn recently. It was an exhilarating feeling to max out literally every single setting in the game...except resolution. I haven't made the move to 4k yet and really don't see any need to any time soon.

I docked a star because the dual 6 pin to 8 pin adapter was not in the box. I had to wait another week for it to arrive, but EVGA was great about it and sent one right out. I wish I could only dock 1/2 a star for this, but that's not allowed so...there you have it.

Part of the star dock is Amazon itself. I had left 2 reviews for this product formerly. They were 2 star and 1 star reviews respectively. And...both magically vanished or never got published. I don't see them in my review history. My intent was to update the review once I received the missing power adapter for the card. I noted this fact in both reviews. I even specified my EVGA account in BOTH reviews.

This is immensely worrisome. As a consumer I should have the right to write a review, good or bad, so long as it's honest. My reviews were.both honest and clear, yet, they never showed up. I'll leave you to draw you own conclusions."

-Amazing card for the price
-Very reputable company
-Stays cool!
-Runs any game I throw at it at about max settings at 1080p (probably an overkill for 1080p)
Cons:
-Fans are slightly louder than wanted, but you can’t hear them with headphones on so it’s not a major problem

Other thoughs: Upgrading from a PC with integrated graphics, this was amazing. I dumped my summer into a job to pay for these parts, and it runs amazing. Any game I throw at it, it runs with ease, when I could barely get 60fps at low settings beforehand. It’s worth every penny and is one of the best purchases I’ve made so far.

The coil whine is extremely annoying as I don't use headphones most of the time but the horizontal lines are more concerning.

Still, I wanted to put in a 5 star review for EVGA. Their cards are reliable, and of all the customer support experiences I've had, EVGA has been the best. I have terrible luck with parts failing, and when I have to use the warranty, EVGA follows through. Diagnosing a problem? I actually get a person who doesn't sound like he's miserable.
This card in particular has been going strong for 2 1/2 years, but I've never feared it going out thanks to my past experience with EVGA. I'm looking to replace it when something with the power of the 2080 ti comes around that's not stupidly overpriced, and I'd like it to be Nvidia only so I can opt for EVGA again.

Now, I'm sure EVGA aren't the only really good parts maker, but they're the best I've had to deal with."

A card to push most modern games maxed out at 120hz at 1080p. I upgraded from a gtx770 and can report the gpuboss comparison score was accurate, a 40-50% increase in performance and fps. Even better are the thermals. Evga's cooling solution right out of the box kept temps at 66/67c for a 15min heavenbenchark test with everything maxed out (91fps on average). I can't wait to see its OC potential.

This card is performing very well for being bottle necked by 16gb ddr4 1333mhz and an i7 3770k 3.5ghz. I can't wait to see how it will perform when I match it with a mobo, ram, and cpu from a more current generation. Despite paying about $120 more than the original msrp, given the current state of gpu hardware/pricing, I feel this card also gave me the best bang for my buck at the moment and don't see prices falling anytime soon, so I don't regret my purchase."

I have been very pleased with my EVGA 1070! It has been quite stable and a great performer these last 4 years. It's a good looking card without any extraneous RGB lighting and clean, solid styling to the shroud.

The only reason I am looking to upgrade, Hopefully to another EVGA Nvidia card, is because I'm a professional artist in the video game industry and technology has moved on. My clients and work require the newer RTX technology present in the latest cards, and I REALLY need more VRAM.

Sadly, like so many others, I have been unable to acquire a 3000' series RTX card, despite herculean efforts.
So I'll continue to enjoy my 1070 for the performance, stability, and value it provides until such time as I can transition to the latest generation. Even then, this card will live on in my backup workstation.

(I gave 4 stars for tech support only because...I've never had to use any! Its been great. I'm assuming tech support is good, but dont know, so...4 stars for uncertainty)."

I've toyed with the overclocking but don't see any real improvement on FPS and since my FPS is hanging in around 100+ and never drops below 70 I don't really see a need to unnecessarily over-stress the GPU. The RGB LEDs are kick ars though!! I went with a red theme on this build and having the programmable LEDs added that extra touch of nice. I recommend this card to anyone...

I was quite frustrated with the lack of AMD Crossfire support for the R9 390X in Crimson software, and as of this writing, Team Red has nothing to offer at the ""high end"", although I know Vega is due out shortly. Since I recently purchased a new 32"" 2560 X 1440 VA Panel Monitor (for all purpose, including some FPS Gaming), I needed some new Graphics Horsepower.

The GTX 1070 offerings are many, but I chose this particular Card due to the high quality of construction, EVGA Customer Service and Support, and I received a significant and stable overclock out of the box. The Marketing was not just hype, but the performance is truly there. With no adjustments, Nvidia Boost 3.0 has my Card running at 2012 Mhz in Game. I did apply a custom fan curve through MSI Afterburner, and my fans start up at 45 C. I never saw the temperature go above 65 degree C., and the fans are quiet. I am not getting any coil whine, and everything just works. My results at 2560 X 1440 in CRYSIS 3 and Metro Last Light are on Par with what the major reviews have already benchmarked for this Particular GTX 1070 FTW Card. I also like the 10 phase power, and the larger fans over the SC version. I have not Overclocked any further than the out of box settings thus far, but since I already have a significant overclock, I am not strongly compelled to test this further to obtain very small FPS gains. I would rather just move up to a GTX 1080 for that.

I can't comment on the EVGA Precision XOC Program, as I am not using it. I will stick with MSI Afterburner for now. While I think the idea of RGB lighting is pretty cool on the Card, I am personally satisfied with the pale blue color of the default LED color, and I am more satisfied that I do not have to run Precision XOC software just to fiddle with the RGB lighting. I am also staying away from the Nvidia Experience Software. I just do not need it.

I would like to add that I purchased this card, well aware that there have been some expressed concerns about the VRM cooling. As VRMs do run hot, (VGA Card, Motherboard), I do believe that cooling is important. I did go ahead and order the free thermal pad kit available from EVGA, and I will go ahead and install them. EVGA is also offering a BIOS update to address and remediate these concerns. I am pretty comfortable tearing down my PC equipment, and I build my own custom computers. I really like EVGA's approach to this concern, and it is one more reason why I am buying this particular video card from EVGA.

So, for me, it is EVGA FOR THE WIN."

It is absolutely stunning! Something you need to keep in mind is the fact that, in online pictures and videos, the card looks like it has a dark and light grey colour scheme. However, in person, it actually has a black and dark grey colour scheme. In my opinion, pictures and videos of this card simply don't do it justice. It is a stunning and stealthy card that has quite the presence about it. If you are concerned that this card has a 'plastic' look to it, don't worry, in person it looks more like metal and immediately gives you the impression of quality. The RGB is a great touch and brings a lot of extra style to this card. The LED's are a very nice brightness and their colour accuracy is spot on. One thing I will make note of are the RGB animations. Some of these animations are not quite as smooth as they could be, however, I think this might be a software issue and will possibly get smoother out in the future.

Performance is phenomenal! I can throw any triple-A title at it and it remains cool and virtually silent, all the while cranking out frames like nobody's business. I won't say too much more about performance as you can find many tech YouTubers who will give you all the stats and graphs you will need. I will say, however, that coming from a laptop that would practically have a stroke if I opened anything beyond MS Paint, the 5700 XT Red Devil is an amazing experience and has been well worth every cent.

I also want to make a quick note of PowerColor. You see, because of the high demand for these cards, as well as other circumstances, PowerColor was not able to keep up with all of the orders being place (particularly in the US). So, like many others, I had to wait over a month to get my card. However, during this time I came in contact with three PowerColor representatives (one on Twitter, one on Reddit, and one via email), and they were all fantastic with keeping myself and the whole community (especially those on Reddit) up to date and informed about the situation. I'm going to be honest here, I had several opportunities to order a few different 5700 XT's and have them at my front door within a couple of days, all the while I waited for the Red Devil with no word. But it was because of the openness, honesty, and sincerity of PowerColor and its representatives that I stuck with my order and waited it out. One thing is for sure, PowerColor has made me a very loyal customer."

 Finally received mine last week and I was impressed by how fast this thing runs. I am very pleased that this ran close to the msi gtx2080 trio I sent back to Newegg, which btw I would tell others to avoid like a plague due to terrible customer service.

This card runs cool and ran smoothly with the updated drivers that so far I have not encountered any hicups.

The card is huge so be sure your case can accommodate this, but the plus side is that you don't have to worry about the card sagging.

Overall I am satisfied with this card because it offers the best bang for the buck. You wont go wrong with this.

- Phenomenal performance. I was shocked when I launched my games, switched to 4K, and remained at the same 60FPS. I can't play every game at 4K, but I can a lot more than before.
- It looks so NICE. The RGB illuminates a soft light. The backplate is all BLACK. Fantastic design.
- Lights on the ports. This is the future.
- Almost absolutely silent. I hear my CPU fan over it. The most it has gotten to is 50% fan speed, and that was nothing. It sounds like it should be idling at 50%.
- Stays very cool.
- No crashing, blue-screens, or any technical problems so far.

Cons:
- It's pretty big. I had to remove my two front fans to get it into my case which was a big hassle.
- The RGB software is a bit disappointing. The only one worth using is the solid color.
- The ""Red Devil"" text is upside down on the port side.

Other thoughts:
All of the RX 5700 XTs have similar performance. What you should look for then is the temperatures and noise. According to the benchmarks, the Red Devil has one of the best temperatures and noise. The only real rival is the Sapphire Nitro+. I chose this over the Nitro+ because of the design. The Nitro+ is covered in a lame white while this is all black. Plus, this is actually for sale, so.... I'm pretty happy with it."

This card is a monster literally it will crush every game you throw at it, I haven't tested the card to it's full potential but I've been playing Assassins Creed Syndicate, World War Z, Fortnite and Watch Dogs in 1080p 60ghz everything ultra details witch is like a walk in the park for this card, always pushing past 100 fps.

I installed my last drivers and I had no problems, the only thing I can say about this card is that it is powerful man. I upgraded from a RX 580 8GB and I can feel the difference.

Physically this card is so big and it looks aggressive, I feel like if I throw it at somebody I might cause serious injuries you can use this thing as a weapon. It has RGB lights and those are bright, look really nice. The backplate is awesome it has a bull craved on it and it lights up, also the back ports are lit in red. There is a software Powercolor devilzone that let's you configure the lightning of the card, you can configure the lights to do all sorts of things like pulse, flash, blink but the coolest in my opinion is smart, this lightning mode varies it's intensity depending on the load or temperature of your CPU or GPU. You get 1 hdmi port and 3 DP.

This card has a switch that let's you configure the card in two modes: overclocking and silent, of course I have mine in overclocking.

Also the card makes no noise and it runs cool the most hot it gets is 70c under load.

I'll continue to update this review as time passes and I have the chance to push this bad boy to it's limit to see how much performance I can get out of it. I'll buy a 1440p monitor soon and then I'll be able to test 1440p resolution and see if I can play everything on ultra and keep at least 60 fps.

I also play Detroit become human everything ultra, graphics on this game are incredible.

I dont think there is a game I can't play on ultra 1080 60fps. If a games comes out that I can't play I'll let you know but until 2023 or 2024 maybe there will be one.

Was going to return this but gave it one more shot did a complete clean of my windows boot SSD and ran DDU to remove anything left again by Nvidia then put the card back in this time I ran the installer directly from the AMD software on the disc included in the packaging then updated the drivers/software after that and so far it seems to be stable for now. Card does look beautiful. It is massive though so make sure you have a large case. I also dropped it down an additional star because it said it comes with a game either BL3 or new Ghost Recon and I should get a code by email if you ordered it through Amazon.com seller. Never got the code and now in my order details it’s not showing up there that I should be receiving that “gift” anywhere. Pretty shady. I’ve ordered cards through other sites for other builds and had no problems with that before and got the code within a day of purchase. I’ll update ta star again if that gets worked out but not holding my breath.

Update 10/22/19: I updated it 1 Star I got the game code and am impressed by the card. I like it better than the 2060 super thus far."

This card offers exceptional cooling and acoustics. Even in the performance BIOS mode, it is not audible to me when at full load. The performance is outstanding for the price. Upgrading from a Vega 64, there is a noticeable increase in FPS. I game at 2560x1080 and I hope to upgrade to 1440p soon. This card will easily handle the increased resolution. Features such as Radeon Image Sharpening and Freesync work great when enabled. I've had no issues with AMD's drivers as some reviewers have stated. I have not experienced any crashes. Because Navi is being used in the next gen consoles, I am looking forward to seeing how developers will leverage the architecture's underlying features. I am hopeful this generation will age like the fine wine of AMD's past.

One thing to note, this card is massive. If you have a small case you may find fitment difficult. If I could change one thing about this card, I would have utilized a PCB cutout for the PCIe 8-pin power connectors. Not that this will be a problem for many, but I feel it is a little more elegant to have the connectors recessed."

The card is beautiful! No problems get it going at all. It's quiet and I have it on my desk, about 2-3 feet away from me. I replaced my old R9 390 Gaming from Gigabyte which was phenomenal for about 3 years and I wanted to try something new. The first game I wanted to try was GTA V and Watchdogs. With all settings Maxed on both of course. I felt I gained about 20 or so FPS on both games, nothing earth shattering, but I was expecting more. But maybe my system is creating a bottleneck somewhere I don't know.
I tried to do a benchmark and it failed every time with an error that no 3d device was found or something like that. I spent most of the weekend researching, but nothing seemed logical. At first Watchdogs wouldn't run at all and that took hours of research as well, as most posts are from 4 years ago or so. I contacted Uplay and they told me to do the usual stuff, check for drivers, .net stuff, etc. Nothing worked.
I then contacted Power Color and it took 2 days to get a response. I got a one sentence response from what seemed like a human being and the rest of the email was a generic tank response about trying different things. Yes, even checking into my power supply to make sure it is on the list. And yes, even do a fresh install of Windows 10. I replied back that their instructions were ridiculous and I got a response right away to call a phone number.
Then I just happen to get an email from AMD today about the new driver that came out today. I did a clean install of the driver and boom, Watchdogs started working. I haven't done a benchmark yet to see if I get an error, but my advice is if you have issues, wait for AMD drivers as they are coming faster and more frequent.
I would give this card a 4th star, but like I said so far I am getting about 20 or so more frames than with my old card that is 3 years old, 4 if you count release date. If I were to get maybe 35+ FPS, I would give it a 5 star review despite my initial issue, which frankly I expected bumps on the road considering how new this card is.

I bought this card to test out due to curiosity. I was using a EVGA 2070 Super.

Noise - Very little noise. Zero coil squeal. Obviously, if you overclock the card, the fans will produce slightly higher amounts of noise. I game with headphones, so this is not a problem.

Performance - Excellent. This card is powerful enough to run all my primary games at high or ultra settings. I tested on AC:ODY, Doom Eternal, Far Cry 5 & RDR2

Thermals - I tested this card for 7 hours straight, and the temperature never got over 62 degrees Celsius. That is phenomenal.

RGB - Plenty options to choose from, all look great.

Bottom Line: I am not disappointed in this card. I think that if you are a true AMD fan, this card will satisfy your gaming needs. Coming from Nvidia, I was pleasantly surprised to see that AMD has finally released a stable version of their drivers and this card performed very well. The only negative I can think of is the size of it. this card is massive, and you should ensure that your case can fit it properly.

Setup:
1) Case: Corsai 220T
2) CPU: Ryzen 3700X
3) Mobo: Asus 570X Elite"

Powercolor went above and beyond for cooling with the triple fan and ginormous heat sink. The backplate is solid and does not flex. There are multiple RGB zones that you can set with Power Colors software, I personally stick with a rainbow wave to match my system. Something to note is that the card is long and heavy. If you have a smaller case (especially a pre-built), measure your space to ensure it will fit. It is a two slot card, and although for me it is well balanced, it could sag in cheaper cases due to it's size.

This card is currently paired with a Ryzen R5 1600, (OC to 3.9 ghz), 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. I've tested a variety of games, and this card is able to max out everything I've given it at 1080p, at 75fps. This includes, Witcher 3, Borderlands 3, GTA V, Overwatch, League of Legends, Diablo 3, and Cities Skylines. From a benchmarking perspective, it is a nearly 100% increase in performance from my previous RX 480.

Edit: Card has crashed with black screens nearly daily since I have purchased the card. Have worked with support from both AMD and Powercolor and no amount of driver uninstallation and reinstallations will fix it. The performance is incredible when it works, but that is few and far between. Would not recommend buying the card."

Yes I know reviewers have seen higher temps but for the few games I do play it is perfect. Sadly Amazon doesn't have the associated games other sellers have but in all honesty it doesn't bother me at all. Great value card for the price with same performance as the 2070 with 100 dollars savings.

Worth the money now that prices have stabilized on the market."

I researched graphics cards for a while before deciding to go with this card. Graphics cards are so expensive, and I aas concerned I would be disappointed going away from NVidia and I read many reviews on these cards where people had issues with the drivers, and games were crashing. Its always hard to tell when reading a review if the product is at fault or the user is doing something wrong. This graphics card is huge compared to my last one but it did squeeze into my case. Installation of the drivers went smoothly. I installed the drivers that came with the card and then immediately did an update. I did the express installation and set my card to game mode in the AMD driver software. I have played a lot of games with this card for long hours and I have not had one issue with games crashing. I am usually maxing out my frames per second at 144 which is the max my monitor will do. Some games are slightly under 144, but I have my settings mostly maxed out so if I really cared I could lower my settings and probably max out my frames. I have been monitoring temps and they are right where you would expect under extreme load and at idle. On top of being a good performer the card looks nice and is great quality. I recommend this card to anyone who likes to game as much as I do and cannot afford the NVidia 2089ti."

 I knew this would be a big GPU but seeing it in person it’s no joke! It looks awesome! It so big that I cannot Vertically mount it in my rig due to touching my RAM.

I read all the horror stories of the driver issues and it’s only been one day so too soon to tell but no problems yet. I don’t feel I need to overclock this bad boy just yet. It’s fast enough for me. I hear I need to undervolt the gpu for better stability but I’ll worry about that if I run into any issues.

Fantastic GPU, comes out of the box as overclocked so you get the biggest performance you want. Pair this GPU with a high refresh monitor and you will love everything from it.

1440p is definitely the max it can do with great frames, you can probably push it more but I don't have a 4k monitor. All my settings are maxed on every game so that's awesome, I came from an RX 480 because it ended up dying on me lol.

Just as an FYI the power limit while it is on OC'ed mode is 225W so if it hits that it tends to crash (trying to see if there is a way to pass it without crashing, will update if I find a solution) but clock speeds hit 2100 Mhz or so. But if you crash often just turn off your computer and switch it to ""Silent"" mode, it just puts the normal clock speeds in with the boost clock being over 1900 Mhz. Also this is at 1440p, if you run 1080p just keep it OC'ed you should be fine.

Update (for OC mode crashing) (12/18/2020) : for some reason the fans didn't ramp up out of the box so it overheated... So I did a manual ramp up and the Temps are still in the high 70s under full load but that seems to be normal. Oh and power limit is not 225W its much higher, like around 300W. You can double check at Power Color site.

I highly recommend this card, it's fantastic for mid to high end gaming for sub $500 (at time I purchased was around $420 or so). Just make sure you have a high refresh monitor at 1080p or 1440p! You won't regret it!

P. S. : They are running a promo for Godfall and World of Warcraft: Shadowlands at time of review/purchase. It stops by end of year (or so).

Update (12/18/2020): tried doing streaming on Twitch but some reason I crash too often and it seems like it can't handle a game and streaming at the same time. Will update if I find a solution."

Build quality is great and card looks really nice, but I've had nothing but issues since putting it into my pc.

There always seems to be some type of hoop to jump through to get this card running right. Especially if you have multiple monitors. For the first month my second monitor would just blank out randomly. Would have to stand up and unplug/plug in the monitor and all would go back to normal until the next random black screen. This month (had the gpu for 2 months now) when I turn my computer on the resolution on my main monitor (34 inch ultrawide) would go right dead to the middle of the screen while the second monitor is fine. Nothing fixes this except for swapping the main monitor from displayport to hmdi for about 5-10 mins and then switching the cords back. No idea why this keeps happening other than bad drivers that AMD is too busy ignoring so they can get the next gen gpu's out.

I wish I had gone with Nvidia instead. Nothing will ever be perfect but maybe I wouldn't have to spend every morning switching video cables around.

Too late to send it back to Amazon, now just trying to get a refund from PowerColor.

Probably best to stay away. It's been out for almost a year and they still can't get the software right."

YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REGISTER YOUR CARD WITH MSI without this 3 digit CHK number. Also, according to MSI tech support, these cards are for ASIA only and my not be covered under a US warranty.

That being said, The card arrived on time in good condition. It was easy to install so long as you have an 8 pin power connector. Also, be sure to have one or more DP (displayport) cables. This card only has one HDMI out put slot. The rest are DP. The card runs quiet enough under load and it raised my Heaven Benchmark by nearly a 1k over my 1060.

In an all-out attempt to reclaim considerable market share from AMD, Nvidia releases a mid-range graphics card that is anything but. I came from an MSI GTX 1060 6GB that I had overclocked with MSI afterburner, so I wasn't sure if this was going to offer the performance that would justify the upgrade cost. After just one Benchmark, all my worries were put to rest. This card is an absolute Powerhouse and is only about two-thirds of the size of my 1060. It offers performance that at times beats a 1070, and has incredible overclock potential. My GTX 1060 I could overclock the memory speed by about 450 megahertz. The 1660 I have at the maximum overclock MSI afterburner will allow of 1500 megahertz for a total clock speed of 7500 megahertz for video RAM. The core clock can handle what appears to be about 120mhz overclock. I have yet to find a game that makes it fall below 30 frames per second on 4K resolution, with all Graphics settings maxed out. This card also handles virtual reality very well and I would highly recommend for anybody looking to have a cost-effective VR system. You can expect about a 50% jump in performance over a GTX 1060, sometimes more sometimes less depending on the game. It appears that newer games see more of a performance increase than older ones but still a considerable increase no matter what game. I am beyond happy with my purchase and would absolutely do it again and recommend anybody who's on the fence about upgrading from a 1060, to do it"
60.0,MSI Gaming GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 192-bit HDMI/DP 6GB GDRR6 HDCP Support DirectX 12 Dual Fan VR Ready OC Graphics Card (GTX 1660 TI VENTUS XS 6G OC),MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,8000 MHz,6 GB,$189.99,4.8 out of 5 stars,The World's Best Graphics Card under $300,"The MSI Ventus XS OC is a solid design at NVidia's MSRP for the 1660Ti. A two-fan, two-slot design with a backplate will fit in just about any system, short of an ITX system (pictures in my review are the 1660Ti installed in a Micro-ATX case build).

For under $300, the performance and capabilities of this card blow away any and all competition. You can pretty much expect GTX 1070-like performance (some games, it will run faster than a 1070, others slower, but on average, expect pretty-much 1070 performance at a cost that is less than the 1070 was when it launched). The #1 card people use on STEAM right now is the GTX 1060-6GB... this card is a solid 35%-40% faster than a GTX 1060 and will probably replace it as the #1 card on STEAM in the near-future (it's that good). In AMD's corner, at the same price point is the RX 590... this card is 25% faster than a RX 590 and uses half the power consumption, running cooler, quieter and playing games better than the RX 590.

Nvidia has also enabled AMD Freesync monitor support in their GeForce drivers... and it can be any Freesync monitor, not just one on their shortlist. Simply use the latest NVidia drivers, turn-on Freesync on your monitor choose ""Set up G-SYNC"" in your NVidia Control panel and turn it on (only works in Win10, btw). I am using my 1660Ti with an AMD Freesync monitor and it works just great!

There really is no other card in this price bracket that offers better performance, better power usage or that runs cooler for the gaming muscle this card provides. MSI's conservative 2-fan, 2-slot design in the Ventus XS is a well-rounded solid choice without strange gimmicks, too many or too few fans or crazy 3-slot designs seen from it's competitors... all this at NVidia's MSRP makes this simply the best graphics card under $300 at the time of launch.

One of the pictures is a GPU comparison using the Radeon RX 580 as a baseline of 100% tested on Assassins Creed Odyssey at 1080p (courtesy of Tech Deals on YouTube)... every other card listed is in comparison to the RX 580 on the same game and shows how much faster it is in comparison... so the GTX 1660Ti is 42% faster than an RX 580 in that test. Certainly there are faster cards out there, but you need to compare how much you are spending for the performance you are getting... the 1660Ti is a great card for the performance at this price point.

*Late 2019 update: my initial review was written launch week of the 1660Ti (Feb 2019)... as with anything in the tech industry, things change as time marches on. While this card is still an awesome card, and I have ZERO regrets having purchased it and enjoy it every day, if you're looking for a new GPU at the end of 2019 under $300, the only real competition to the 1660Ti is NVidia's own competition... the recently released 1660 Super. The 1660 Super's performance is nearly identical to the 1660Ti across the board... usually the 1660Ti will just barely edge-out the 1660 Super by a frame or two here or there, so the 1660Ti is still technically faster than the 1660 Super, but not anything that anyone would notice (literally only one or two FPS in any game)... the difference is the 1660 Super is cheaper than the 1660Ti... so you can save a good chunk of change and ALMOST get the exact same performance of a 1660Ti if you pick up a 1660 Super. If you already or recently purchased a 1660Ti, you still have a great card and the best of the 1660-series... if you're about to buy one however, I might suggest looking at the 1660 Super line of cards, as they have basically the same performance at a slightly lower price point (about $50 less).

I had to settle for an EVGA 1050 as everything else was far out of my price range. The card was ok, but was far too loud and only 4 gig. The 20 series nVidia cards are too expensive for me so when I saw info posted about the 1660Ti coming out I was immediately interested.

I've never owned an MSI card so I read a lot of early reviews when the 1660Tis were being released. Took a chance on this card and couldn't be more pleased. I flight sim mostly, IL-2 Great Battles BoX being my sim of choice. The MSI card handles my sim very well with very respectable frame rates at 1080p. I posted a link in the Q&A section to a YouTube video I created showing the numbers the MSI 1660Ti is capable of. It runs very quietly and it doesn't seem prone to overheating.

Good card. For the price I feel like I've gotten an amazing deal."

Replaced a gtx 1060 3gb EVGA card. Installation was easy but my PC cannot take a bigger card. I would recommend a 450 to 500 wt power supply at least. Needs 8 pin connector.

So after all that I installed the new one carefully taking my time after seeing how others did it online on youtube and was able to do this myself pretty easily. After I installed it and install the drives from online that I had download from nivida website beforehand, I installed them and that's it, it worked. Nothing more needed to be down. Just had to make sure i didn't accidentally unplug anything on the motherboard and make sure nothing was in the way of the fans. I keep my wires nice and tidy so its not one big mess, but other then that, I don't think I could of done this any better. Everything works, didn't get a bad gpu as far as I can tell and i'm pretty content with it. Thank you, I look forward to my next upgrade in the future... Although there was one strange annoyance I had with it and had discovered what it was online, something about a c-port drive that couldn't be updated because I think I was suppose to install some sort of virtual drives for a vr head set even though I don't own or use one. Anyways I found out what it was on reddit and was mention that it was okay to disable it since it wouldn't do any harm, so I did and haven't had any troubles since. So Just a heads up if your buying this or a higher end graphics card. Also I held down the power button for 60 sec's when making sure there was no more electricity after I had unplugged everything(to avoid esd)."

If you can find a GTX 1070 for cheap or at the same price, that's still a better option. I bought this to hold me over till Nvidia release the 3000 series next summer. It's a good budget card. I can plays games at 1080 way above 60 FPS in most games.
The color is silver, but it looks good in a white build. It's plasticky, including the back plate, and the fans don't stop when idle like on the higher end card but it's quiet and only get loud under heavy load.

One of the better graphics card for budget build."

I purchased this card for the GPU, 1660 TI after careful research. Although ATI has a cheaper card with good performance its not quite the level of this and this card in the price range smokes the competition. Although you could consider the 1660 also which is cheaper. Playing with games, it works fine and I haven't had any problems graphics wise.

This is my first MSI product, they used to have a reputation for poor quality but the card works fine, it has a nice solid back and it has the same warranty as the other manufactures. It comes with 2 fans and it takes up 2 slots. This is the main reason I bought this over the evga, the evga takes up 3 slots.

The reason I am giving this card 3 stars is because Nvidia has problems with its drivers. When I first installed this on windows 10 1607, a message came up "" This Nvidia Graphics Driver Is Not Compatible with This Version of Windows"". It tells you nothing else and at first I thought the card was broken. I figured out you have to have a more recent update of windows, although its not certain which one. I ended up updating to the latest version. Which is slower and it has extra junk I don't care about. There seems to be no substantive reason to have the latest version and is just a gimmick to make you update. I've never had to update to the latest version of a OS for other graphics cards.

I think if you spend close to 300 dollars on a video card, you should be able to install it on whatever version of Windows 10 or 7 or any other OS that you want. So I am giving this 3 stars. Hopefully ATI gets their act together and in the future I will buy from them instead."

I did have issues with the card lighting up displays at login (windows 7), and the solution was to put one of the AMD 5770's back in the PCIe lower slot. the 1660ti is too tight for the bottom slot on the MacPro. At some point I'll update the rest of my system with a PC Mobo and switch the card out but at the moment I have a great workstation for Blender and other 3D work. It runs very quiet and for CUDA intensive projects this thing is very impressive when compared to RTX cards that are way out of my budget. This is my first MSI card, I've used Asus cards in the past, the MSI feels solid and not like something that was built cutting corners. Any issues I had getting it started I blame on the age of the Mac Hardware that's hosting this GPU, not the GPU."

Would have preferred another brand since the previous did stop working, after all, but this one was available next day and production time yada yada. Arrived 14 hours later at 2:30 pm. Bit of a struggle for some reason to get the port end into the side slots but it did go in.
Card is, if anything, more compact than the previous 780 ti, and uses less power, with a better overall finish. There's a back plate to cover the fish and chips on the circuit board. Fans are OK noise wise but not the quietest (Zotac, for example, quieter under load).

I was dubious about the memory bandwidth and shaders, but, in fact, no worries, the newer design more than compensates. Playback and export in Premiere only uses 60-70 percent of the card, even with 4K clips with a ton of filters, so this card is fine for most people. You can step up to the 20 series but it is an incremental gain.
Using neat video, interestingly, the optimum frame rate uses *only* the GPU! That frees up the CPU. Getting over 6fps render in Neat video with 4K clips using GPU only. Not great, but better than what I had before. The 6GB ram seems OK for 4K, I doubt it will handle 8k but whatever. Has display ports and HDMI 2.0

MSI terminology for the flavors of these cards is confusing, and *Ventus* sounds like a coffee term, and you may have to install the USB C driver even if there is no port. Still, a solid card."

I stepped up to this after running a Crossfire configuration of 2 AMD R9 290. From 2014. So I have no bias one way or the other. With my setup of a Ryzen 5 3600, an OS SSD and a games-only SSD, this GPU and 16G RAM, I can play anything I have. Doom '16 gives me 110 fps at 1080p and 80 fps at 1440p. Even at full 4k I get about 50 fps so it's quite playable and that is at max settings. Fallout 4 is 60fps at 1080p and 1440p, max settings. Metro:Exodus- 70fps at 1080p, 55 fps at 1440p, max settings. Metro:Exodus is probably the game I have that most pushes this GPU and it still does well. It will play 4k but at 30fps, less sometimes. I consider that unplayable but others might not. The fans are quiet and the size is great. I recently moved to a mid size case in the Corsair ICUE 220t RGB which is a fairly compact case for being mid-size. The GPU fits it perfectly with a little room to spare. I think this GPU will last me a good long while until I step up to a true 4k/ray tracing big boy. For now, this card is a bargain for the price ($264 is what I paid in 11/2019)."

This card suits my needs, it has good performance for mid to upper mid games, and *was* the affordable card before moving into the RTX 20-- cards. Do not pay a hair above $250 for this card, it good but not worth 500+. MSI made a good product with this one, but again at this time this card is on its way out, now that we're into the RTX 30-- series.

Was a great buy for me, not only did I get it for less than 1/2 the price but it works perfectly. I put this card in my Lenovo ThinkCentre M92p 3209EK4 SFF. The card is a perfect fit and slipped right into the PCIe x16 slot without any problems at all and takes up only 1 slot location. Booted system and card was auto recognized and booted into Windows 10 Pro without any problems. At first it was recognized as ""Basic graphics card device"" but that was only for 20-30 seconds. Windows automatically downloaded and installed the proper drivers for Nvidia Geforce GT 730 and screen flashed a few times and then it was updated in the Device Manager as Nvidia Geforce GT 730. If need the proper drivers are on the Lenovo website for download, but not needed for Windows 10 Pro. Then installed the Nvidia Geforce Experience software and upgraded to the latest drivers. All flawless and very fast. Card is working perfectly in my system. Runs around 31-32 degree C at idle when not doing anything graphically intensive. Playing WoW Mists of Pandaria I can play on High and get 40-50 fps, or I can play on Good and get 65-80 fps. I have it set to a custom setup (mix between Good and High settings with a few Ultra on) and I get 60-75 fps. Card plays the game with PSU temp 55-60 degree C, and Fan at 23%-33% (fan is very very quiet, I have not heard any sound from it at all). Top of the desktop case still stays very cool to the touch - not in the least bit warm. I love this system mine has Core i7 with 16gb RAM and 240gb SSD and a 1TB HDD. Might not be a top end gaming PC, but it runs all the games I care to run with awesome speed and wicked graphics and the system is still cool as a cucumber.

Every game in existence bows before the power of this card (which is more of a brick than a card at this point, but anyway). If you're going to a 4K gaming rig, this is your card. I had Asus' GTX1070 in my setup before this, and while it performs admirably at 4K, you seriously can't beat the GTX1080. It's worth the extra money.
This particular card has some very nice bells and whistles. Keep in mind the fans don't spin at all while the GPU is idle, so it does run a bit hotter than EVGA's cards, but not to where it would cause issues. Actually it's able to stay around 40-45C while doing this, and it'll significantly cut back on dust build-up as well. There are 2 PWM fan headers on the side of the card. I have my front intake fans hooked up to those so they don't spin either until the GPU is under load, overall making my PC near-silent at idle (except for my HDD). You can use GPU Tweak II to manually set fan speed curves, but the automatic ones cool the card just fine, and GPU Tweak II is a poorly-programmed mess of bugs so I don't recommend it.
The Aura RGB lighting looks great, but for two problems. One, there are two bright white LED's on the power connectors (6pin and 8pin) that are always white. Really detracts from the look. Second, the Aura software itself, like GPUTweak is riddled with bugs. It actually caused a BSOD on login when I first installed it, and I had to do a system restore. Then, it took me a couple tries to actually get it to stay on the right color (My motherboard is Aura RGB too, so they're synced up.)
My advice: Tape over the white LED's with electrical tape (it holds up to the heat), set your LED's to the color you want and don't mess with the software again unless you have to.
One more quick note: The MSRP of this model is $650. Don't pay more than that for it. Let the scalpers die out."

This card changed that. Extra HDMI port, looks better than the EVGA card (Asus card has LED lit logo on the top of the card) since LED lighting on the fan side (bottom.) is pointless unless you mount the cards vertically. More importantly, FASTER advertised speeds. Don't be a jerk and buy multiple cards then send them back because they don't meet YOUR overclocking standards. If it works as advertised, you got what you paid for.

Both cards work without issue using the Asus software auto OC settings. Aalthough I personally prefer MSI Afterburner, this again is part of the advertised function, and it works as it should making setup faster and easier. While faster than my 2 EVGA GTX 980 ACX 2.0 cards, they're not as fast as NVidia would like you to believe..

With the OC profile enabled which gives me a max 2080MHz clock, during benchmarking tests (in particular I had Unigine Valley running for about 30 minutes) my temps reached 68*C despite an aggressive custom fan profile set to run the fans at 75% (50%@50*C / 100%@70*C) once temps reach 65*C.The side of my case is also mesh (Rosewill Blackhawk Ultra full tower), so these cards have little to no restrictions on venting hot air. That being said, most people to appear to be suggesting a custom fan profile anyway. It's easy to do, so do it!"

I'm running it in a Corsair Obsidian 750D case, an AX860i PS, and an i7-7700K, on a ROG Strix Z270E MB. 4 big case fans, plus a Corsair H115i liquid CPU cooler. I ran a double simultaneous torture test, prime95, and Furmark, and the GPU temp stays below 68 degrees C. It's overclocked to 1926 MHz (higher than the advertised 1810), voltage is +25%, Memory clock is +970 (10980), and power set to 120%. That torture test should have melted everything, but no matter what I do, I can't get the GPU much above 68 degrees C with this setup and fan speed profile. The GPU fans never even get to 50%. I think that's incredible. I can run X-Plane 11 Beta with details way high (Not max but plenty high enough), at 3840x2160 at 60 FPS (display port). Very happy with the purchase. I think in a year or two, when the price of this card coms down and I'm ready for an upgrade, I'll just buy another one and run SLI. My system is ready for it but no need to spend the money for a second GPU right now."

You only need one,"This card is so quiet and chews through any game you throw at it. At this point there is a wealth of scientific data to convince you, so I'll put it simply. This card is excellent. You only need one. It works great for Adobe apps and handles games in 4k, many on ultra settings. You can change the colors and the build quality is great. No issues installing or setting it up.

I made the mistake last generation of 1. going with EVGA and 2. getting SLI 970s. I bought one at a time as I could afford them, but you really need to save and get the best possible card the first time. While it could handle 4k gaming on medium or high, game support was annoying and the driver updates kept kicking it back to single card mode."

Quite a bit larger than I'd anticipated, but after re-wiring some cables inside my case, it was able to fit with no problem. The integrated LED lighting on the card looks incredibly cool especially when combined with all the other case lighting I have. It can all be controlled with the bundled software for lighting effects and overclocking. It's been able to handle every game I've thrown at it without missing a beat. I can run Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, Dishonored 2, GTA5, Fallout 4, Skyrim and others at maximum settings. 4K texture mods for Fallout and Skyrim? Not a problem. Running multiple monitors? Give it another one. Great card but don't pay more than about $680 for it, because if you pay more they're ripping you off."

Never a problem that I didn’t cause :-). This Card is beautiful and works quite well. I do not ( yet) have 4K monitors, so it is no surprise it drives those I have perfectly.
The card runs quite cool—36 def C at last check. This may well be because I’ve only been doing set up, etc. if problems arise, I’ll edit this review. My plan is to build a new rig with either Threadripper or 8th gen Intel and this Card will eventually migrate there.
The card is huge, and it is easy to get it misaligned when you think you’re right on. It is also easy to hit jumpers, etc and disconnect them. I’ve gone through multiple cards over the years, and this is the most difficult to install in that it is easy to get it wrong. Also, it requires two additional power inputs, an 8 and a 10 pin connector. It also has two fan controllers for case fans. Four conductor lines are necessary to take advantage of this feature.
Finally, do not trust the registration program that is installed with the drivers!! When I tried to use it, it picked up my motherboard S/N, , but let me type in the device description. It would not let me change the S/N and when ASUS came back with info that the device was already registered, I dashed on a supercritical review for Amazon, then went on the ASUS website to tell them the problem. They asked for the S/N, which I entered as the one the registration program found and my motherboard popped up! The program thought I was trying to re-register my motherboard and would not let me enter the correct serial number.
So here I am, back at Amazon, re-writing this review. It was only up for maybe an hour, but if anyone saw it, it is wrong. I did get a new card as ordered, Amazon did a perfect job, and I learned to check everything out before writing in anger."

I was hesitant on trying a new style of GPU but I am happy for the most part.

I will start off with the shipping and packaging section of the review. The GPU came inside of a well fitted box with room to spare so it wasn't smashed lowering the chances of breaking. Inside of the Amazon box, the GPU was surrounded with the air packaging around all sides. There wasn't any dents or scratches on the box or GPU itself and am happy with how it was packaged.

Opening up the actual box that held the GPU always puts a smile on the face. Everything was nicely inside and was obviously brand new. The GPU did not have any scratches or dents. The product was exactly how described in length and looks. One worry from other reviewers was the length of this GPU and if it would fit inside of their cases. I can vouch that it is very long and does need a pretty wide case to fit.

This GPU has 3 fans installed which help for the length and the power. I took off one star due to the fact of the noise it makes sometimes. I am hearing a small coil like sound coming from the GPU and as it is quite annoying it does not mess with performance. So far, I ran games such as Total war Rome 2 and Warhammer, Skyrim Special Edition, and Torchlight 2 for a smaller scale game, and the heat the GPU was putting out was very minimal.

Continuing performance, I can run any game on max/ultra settings and even customize the settings further to find the max potential. I also heavily mod my games with 50 + mods in Skyrim and this runs everything perfectly. I can't complain even about a hiccup in graphics.

I suggest everyone to add this GPU on their list when comparing which graphics card to choose for their next build or upgrade."

No coil whine on mine.
Super fast 4k no issue on any AAA title.
Lighting is cool, although I really couldn't care less about that kind of stuff.

If you're looking at a 1080, I would suggest this one. I waited since they came out to get one to see what issues they would have. I know some people have complined about coil whine at high FPS, but mine has none. I have tested it on a 3840x2160 tv and 3440x1440 monitor and it is flawless. If you have a 1920x1080 I wouldn't get one though, I could still run everything with a pair of 4GB 760s just fine. It wasn't until I upgraded my tv and monitor that things started to slow down and get choppy."

Other observations:
Installed in minutes with no issues at all.
Its huge. No seriously its HUGE.. Make sure you have enough room in your case... It was at least twice the size of the RX480 it replaced.
Big power supply is important... If you get random reboots for no dicernable reason like I was getting its probably time to upgrade your PS. I got a 1KW and it seems to do the job.
At idle in the default mode the fans dont run at all... This may mean it idles a little hotter than some other cards at idle but no where near a temperture to be worried about and its GREAT for people with pets and lots of dust as it keeps the entire cade from having to be cleaned out as often.
I have yet to find a game that doesn't default to max settings on my 4K TV. Thinking about some VR gear now just to find something that'll give it a workout.
Have not had the card long but the PC has been on continiously with one game or another running or minimized in the background and have not had a single glitch, crash or hiccup of any kind

For reference rest of the system is and i7, 16gb, 512 PCI-E SSD in an accient coolermaster case using a crappy rigged up liquid cooler that was designed to fit some processor they quit making a long time ago and modified with some sheet metal and drills and taps so the cooling block fit the i7... RAM is overclocked a little, i7 is running at normal speed. Havent messed with card settings at all... Can't imagine what the point would be given how it runs already."

So when putting together my most recent build I went with a known quantity and choose again, an Asus ROG Strix card. This time using the 1080 now that prices are more reasonable. These cards are awesome in performance as well as looks. Very quiet even when working that GPU for max FPS. My temps have never exceeded 70 degrees, even after running Unigen Valley with high and ultra settings at 1440p, for 4 hours straight. Fan noise, whats that? I could not tell except for my software reporting to me that they were running. These cards have some headroom left if you want to tweak the clocks a bit, come with a great software set and the RGB is an added touch to perk up any build but, even when turning the RGB lighting off they look great with that super sleek backplate. No ugly PCB here! The packaging of these cards is excellent. These cards are longer about 11.5 inches so, make sure your chassis can handle it and that you'll have the clearances you need. You want a mid size chassis at least. Especially, if you run a front mounted radiator. For this build, I used a Define S chassis and the Strix 1080 fits nicely with plenty of room with a front mounted rad with the fans in a push configuration. I could even do push pull configuration and still have clearance"

Picture yourself a tweaker of video game settings, a performance/visual quality conoisseur. You know exactly what settings to lower just a touch to get 10 more FPS with no visible hit, or such a small amount you still feel like a genius for getting that many FPS out of the game.

Picture yourself buying this card, as I did. Picture yourself saying ""Oh man, I can't wait to see which of my games I can NOW run at 60 FPS! Maybe I can crank up those settings!!""

It turns out, with this card, the answer is ""All of them"" and ""You always can.""
This card is so unstoppable, it was actually a letdown for a tweaker like me. ""But but... surely I can't max GTA5 with even those crazy AA settings enabled... I'll have to tweak something...""
Nope. It can do it. All."

However, whenever I went to place my order they didn't have it in stock and wouldn't for a couple of weeks. Seeing as how i was building a Gaming rig from scratch, I just couldn't see having a tower sitting there for two weeks with no gaming capability at all. This popped up and at the time it was only $100 more than the 1070 I had saved in my cart. I'm glad amazon was out of stock now.

I play some pretty graphic heavy games.(Ark, Metal gear solid TPP, Rainbow 6 Siege, just to name a few) and I had been playing on an asus laptop with a 970M GPU. I could barely play ark on a modified ""high"" setting. I had to lower several of the more detailed options manually. But this GPU... I have it running on epic with only ""Sky quality"" lowered to about half(and thats mainly because it can cause too much of a visual glare like looking into the sun) Now I haven't checked an actual FPS counter, But I can tell you I have no screen tearing, no lagging, no glitches! I run at 1920x1080 Borderless window mode and This thing can handle Ark with a breeze.

Using Asus Gpu Tweak II app found on their website I was able to create a custom profile using the base stock overclock preset and ramping up fan power that runs the GPU at 102%power at around 60 to 64 degree(Celsius) while playing Ark.

When playing Rainbow 6 Siege with a friend, I ran the in game benchmark and was getting 250+FPS(not sure how accurate it is). It was quite impressive.

And finally i use Uniging Heaven Benchmark to put a massive stress test on this GPU. I am happy to say that on the higest possible settings, It ran between 95-120 FPS without ANY Issues at all!

I may buy a second and run SLI one day but for now, This graphics Card has NO DOWNSIDES!!!. The RGB lighting isn't overkill either. I have an Asus z270F motherboard and using the asus Aura app syncs all the RGB LEDs up flawlessly and easily I just can't say enough about this GPU. I'd give it more stars if I could"

I played pubg with all ultra settings. I was getting about 120 fps on average with a low of 100. I upgraded from a 970 so it's not a huge improvement on some games but I'm now running the 1080 and the 970 for dual monitors and it is less of a load for the one graphics card and I plan to get a vr headset in the future and the 1080 is perfect for that so I highly recommend this card. I will plan to give an update once I've used it for a while.

So update I've had it for about 5 months and it is still running smoothly. The temperature hasn't gone above 67°c and that's running vr and a monitor with fallout 4 vr. The rgb lighting has been a bit buggy for me to figure out but that's mostly the software. But that graphics card is amazing."

But for the Strix side of the card, I seriously think its the best card, I am getting a 1080ti shipped to my house (late gift from my father) and I was filled with joy when he told me it too was a Strix because this thing never gets above 60C and GPU boost 3.0 really ramps up this card because of it, the fans as advertised never turn on until I start a game, and they dont even turn on for me when I play minecraft (I dont actually play I wanted to see if the fans would turn on and they didnt)

All in all the 1080 is in a weird spot, but if you want to get a 1070, 1070ti or a 1080 or 1080ti the Strix is the best card you can get IMO, it is a little pricey sometimes but if you see it on sale its a steal"

Regardless of the fact that I am doing this for points, I found the product worth the investment in my New(ish) build. At the time of purchase I did manage to get this around MSRP. The RGB looks amazing with its bright vivid colors. The card have some issues with it not being able to work properly at times due to an update, Aura at times does not register it there. Quick fix is restarting, or logging out of Windows to return it there.

OC Scanner 1.9.7.1 Aura
It came damn close to my OC that I found my card can do 1910 Boost CLK MHz. This is the most rounded stable speed I found that all the games I play work well this. Memory CLK was odd with OC Scanner, was only able to get an additional 1K added, my OC was higher than that before I started artifacting.
Main Titles: Farcry 5, Fortnite

I'm not one for quiet cards, I would much rather have a cool (temp) card. I'm aggressive when it comes to my fan curve. Idle: 45c Load: 60?c It's just ironic that both met inside my NZXT H700i.

The one thing I would like to add is that whining sound may, or may not be there.
RGB is heavy to the right, I would have liked to see spread out over the card. Only like 40% of the card is RGB;"

However if you’re as on the edge about whether or not to upgrade to this graphics card, you should, because it shows, it is a monster of a GPU and it’s quiet, so so quiet, it has RGB you can control also.! I upgraded from an XFX RX 480 and am running on a Ryzen 7 2600X and so right now I’m set for a while, and likely you will be as well, so just buy it, you won’t need to upgrade for a very long time

As always Amazon takes care of shipping and handling amazingly

The box is awesome looking, and when opening the package it almost seems like you’re opening a briefcase of millions of dollars, ROG makes really nice looking products and this definitely shows here as well from the outside in

Keeps nice and cool, nice and quiet, and looks awesome with LED lighting.","I am not the biggest gamer that ever lived, but I recently bought the HTC Vive virtual reality system, and I wanted a video card that could handle that, and whatever other games I wanted, so I wouldn't have to update to a new card in a year or less. I looked at other cards, and this card was better than 2 of the next best cards, but priced at less than 2x the price. So, the choice was obvious: Buy two competing cards, spending more money, getting less performance, or buying this card.

I run all my games on a 4K UHD monitor, and I use the highest settings. I have never seen a visible lag, or pixilation, it is just flawless. As for the virtual reality, it is amazing, with this card there is no comprehensible lag between motion and update on the display. It is so incredibly immersive. I have to assume this card has a lot to do with just how great this experience is. If you are considering getting the Titan, or this, get THIS. If you ever need a little boost then you buy a second 1080, and put it in SLI mode. The two 1080's are still cheaper than the Titan, and I guarantee you that this is the only card you will need for a while. With DDR4 memory, 4Ghz CPU, M.2 HDD, and this card there is nothing this machine cannot do. You can enable every setting, to the max, 4K resolution, and this card just happily takes it. The STRIX supports overclocking via their app, so you can squeeze out a little more if you need it, but I seriously doubt you will need if for quite a while.

I have played with the app, it lets you overclock as you want, and it lets you set the fan thresholds, and colors, etc. I tried overclocking a bit, and it worked just fine, but I haven't found a game that it couldn't handle without overclocking, so I don't bother to actually use it. You can create different profiles, so you can easily turn on or off the overclocking. I set the fan to be quiet, but I don't set it at the 0db setting. I prefer a little fan noise and keeping my card nice and cool. However, in the case that I have I cannot hear the fan, so it really doesn't matter.

I set the colors to match the motherboard, case, keyboard and mouse. Now my computer looks like a work of art. It is something I display proudly as it is just so friggin cool.

The specs speak for themselves. 8GB of VRAM is impressive, especially that it is GDDR5, running at 1,825Mhz at 256-bits in width. That is a sick memory throughput. The new Titan is the only card that I know of that can beat this one in compute power, but it is not as good for gaming as this. The number of CUDA cores is staggering, something like 2560+. This video card is a true supercomputer in and of itself. But, it plays games like they're nothing. It just works, on the highest setting, at 4K resolution, or in Vive VR, and it doesn't even get hot. It usually runs like 40-50C at the most when playing the most taxing games. Keeping it nice and cool will ensure a long life span.

I don't know what else I can say. If you want to play the newest and best games, this is the card for you. Whether you are a true overclocker, or just want to drop in the card and forget it, this is the card for you. If you have a fancy machine, with LED lighting, and an open side panel, this is the card for you. I had originally bought the reference model of the 1080, but I changed to the ROG version for the better fans, and more sturdy heat sink.

Another great feature is the number of video ports this has. It has 2 UHD HDMI ports, two full sized display port ports and a DVI port. I use one of the DP with my HTC Vive, and one of the HDMI with my Samsung 28"" 4K UHD monitor.

Pros: Incredible performance, as good or better than 2 of the next best cards. Supports SLI for 2 or three cards. Has 8GB of GDDR5 memory, and over 300 CUDA core. Plays the newest games in 4K UHD with >60fps and never lags or stutters. 2 HDMI and one DP for multiple monitors, or VR. Works perfect with HTC Vive.

Cons: It is a bit pricey. But, when you figure you would need to of the next best card to compete, it is really not that bad."

The aura LEDs are really nice, although there seems to be a light filtering inconsistency that results in the backplate lighting not matching the side/bottom lighting perfectly in shades of colors that contain blue. This also results in issues when trying to get perfect white. The backplate leds seem to produce a ""normal"" white (at least as normal as can be expected for an RGB led system) that matches other components relatively well, while the bottom of the card produces a purple/pinkish hue that is noticeably off.

I chose the MSI version simply because it was reviewed as being quiet which is only true at low power. Additionally, I found that - the MSI utilities are lacking, some don't work, and others require logging in and providing personal information in order to activate. Asking a support question requires creating a logon which asks many questions including some that are so personal that I would not want them on Facebook, requires unrelated and detailed system information, and cannot be completed because some 'required' fields do not allow data entry. The card itself is okay (except for an RGB problem that I cannot get resolved due to the inability to create a support ticket), but both the lacking MSI utilities and the inability to get support has soured me against ever purchasing another MSI product."

No need to go to the rtx series. There are cheaper 1660 ti cards any of them will do the job for less. This is a premium card and I have had good luck with msi products so stuck with it. I also like the look and feel of the card. Great build and quality. DO NOT INSTALL Mystic light! It is the only downfall to the whole line. But compared to the 2060 super (I have one of them as well) the jump in price is not noticeable for the common 1080p gamer. There are not many games to utilize the new features in the rtx line and unless you just have to have it. With 100$ jump you are not going to tell a difference.

Cons:
The LEDs/Lighting effects don't appear to be controllable unless you have an MSI compatible motherboard. Could be user error, but I've tried several versions of their software to no avail.

That's it. No other con. Really an amazing video card for the price. Would totally suggest this over a 2080 or new high end card."

Sure they have a pamphlet with pictures...but nothing about troubleshooting. Took me about 30 minutes of doing my own troubleshooting to get it to work correctly. I only have 1 build in my experience but these companies who make parts to build the pc is flippin stupid. They expect you to know what to do right out of the box.

I thought it was my power supply or RAM and replaced both as a result, but issues persisted until I reinstalled my old graphics card. I want to experience the excitement others have expressed for this card but now I'm looking at a return to get my pc functioning again. Very disappointing to say the least."

Game ran super smooth with my new Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, and 32GB of (yeah, overkill) ram.

The card is fantastic in the acoustics department, it hardly makes any sound and my PC isn't even installed in the case yet, it's just sitting on a table all laying around. At the end of the day, I was like you, wondering if I should get the less expensive Sapphire Pulse, and save $50... But then a few days ago I was like, you know what - I've been looking at these cards every day for a month, I'm just gonna TREAT MYSELF and get the one with the best cooling so it lasts the longest, and has some resale value 5yrs from now.

For those of you still reading, the two least expensive cards with the best cooling & thermals are the Sapphire Pulse for $410, and the GIGABYTE Gaming OC $420. The two most expensive cards with the best cooling & thermals are this card $460, and the PowerColor Red Dragon $440. ...Any of these 4 cards are going to be the cream of the crop, and honestly I wouldn't recommend the rest of the partner cards - as these 4 options have no faults whatsoever.

PROS:
+ Uses a reasonable 222W under load, whereas the stock AMD 5700 XT uses 186W
+ Fan speeds are 1,400RPM under load, whereas the stock ""blower"" card (with just 1 fan) runs at 2,100RPM
+ Due to the low fan RPM, the fan noise under load is just 43dBA, versus 52dBA for the stock card
+ Thanks to the 3 fan design, the temperature of the card maxes out at just 71C, VS 84C for the stock card
Note: fan/temp stats were tested by our Australian friends over at Hardware Unboxed in their YouTube video entitled: ""Sapphire RX 5700 XT Nitro+, Another Top Notch 5700 XT""

CONS:
- I'm experiencing minor audio issues with some video playback, but I haven't used DDU to clean install my drivers recently

Conclusion:
I recommend this card to everyone, and if you don't want to pay the ~$50 premium for this amount of cooling quality and low operating volumes, you can absolutely get either the GIGABYTE Gaming OC, or the Sapphire Pulse card and still have fantastic cooling and fan volumes."
64.0,Sapphire 11293-03-40G Radeon NITRO+ RX 5700 XT 8GB GDDR6 Dual HDMI / Dual DP OC (UEFI) PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card,SAPPHIRE,AMD,14 GHz,8 GB,$189.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,This card is amazing... but it might not seem that way right out of the gate,"First off, this review is written without taking into consideration the state of AMD's drivers (though if you are reading this, at the time of this writing 20.1.2 is the latest and greatest and it is very stable; I recommend either 19.12.1 or 20.1.2 at this time for this card; whatever you do DO NOT run 19.12.2 even if it is the ""recommended"" version). I will talk about drivers at the end, but you can't really blame Sapphire for bad drivers as they aren't the ones writing them. As such, I do not feel it fair to knock of stars for AMD's shaky drivers.

Second, some of the negatives I am going to talk about are not necessarily the fault of the card, but rather the X570 chipset and motherboard manufacturer's BIOS bugs for other chipsets.

Let me start with the basics. The card is massive. It may not fit in your case. Make sure you check clearances before buying this card. And, depending on the way the PCIe slots are set up in your case, this card can be very hard to install. With an X570 Aorus Master and a Phanteks P400A it takes a great deal of patience to install and remove this card as there just isn't enough clearance over the audio cover coupled with the fact the card has to fit through a thin slot to be screwed down (as opposed to say Fractal's Meshify C, which would be a breeze to install if the card fits, which depending on fans/radiotors might not in that case).

The RGB is surprisingly tatsteful. I'm not big into the overdone RGB common to many ""Gamer"" oriented products, but since you can't really avoid it if you want to be competitive in that space, I do appreciate the Sapphire did it well (and it's super easy to turn off/tweak in TriXX or slave to your RGB headers on your motherboard).

If you haven't already, you should check out Gamer's Nexus review of this card as they touch on all the great technical features and design considerations of this card. For those who are less interested, I'll give a short summary. The card performs amazingly well with extremely good thermals for a 5700XT (these cards run hot) with reasonable fan noise. Additionally, it has three operating modes (performance, quiet, and TriXX).

One more positive note before I delve into the negatives I've experienced with this card. Sapphire support is fantastically responsive. I went back and forth with them multiple times a day for weeks early on as I debugged the various problems I had with the card.

Now onto the negatives/advisories (notice I still give a 5 star rating; the card is amazing now that it works well and I have workarounds for the last few caveats which I will mention as I go; I also admit there was a time where I was thinking about selling it and buying an EVGA 2070S FTW3, but that was on the 19.12.2 drivers).

When I first built my new rig (X570 Aorus Master, R7 3800X), I had countless issues trying to get the machine to display the boot splash and BIOS screens when connected to my monitor (MAG271CQR from MSI; 1440P@144Hz VA) via Display Port. This was true for both Gigabyte's Aorus Master and MSI's MEG ACE. The ASUS Crosshair VIII Hero Wi-Fi did not have this problem. This is because (according to Sapphire) Navi doesn't always play nicely with CSM (legacy boot). Disabling CSM in the BIOS fixes this issue. Unfortunately CSM enabled is the default for most motherboards (the C8H defaults to UEFI only boot/CSM disabled), so I have a workaround when clearing my CMOS or upgrading my BIOS: I use HDMI for the initial BIOS configuration. Another setting for those who need CSM enabled is to set PCIe/VGA to UEFI only when CSM is enabled.

According to various forums, this card (like all RX 5700 cards) can have issues with certain chipsets that do not support PCIe 4.0 (such as AMD's X470 and B450 boards). When installing this card, if you have a PCIe 3.0 motherboard, you should change your PCIe mode from ""AUTO"" to 3rd gen; this will make sure your card runs nice and stable. For some reason, on certain boards the firmware can't auto-negotiate the generation correctly and the card becomes unstable.

The card is extremely power hungry. Make sure you run individual feeds from your PSU to each of the 8-pin PCIe power connectors on this card. If you run only a single cable and use the daisy chain connectors you are going to have a bad time. Additionally, Sapphire recommends 600W as a bare minimum with 650W being preferred. Unless you have a high end PSU (such as Corsair, EVGA, SeaSonic, etc...) that is 80+ Gold or better, 650W is not going to cut it. Cheap PSUs struggle to ramp up to the power demands of this card. Sapphire lists the pull at 285W; I've pulled 300W with stock settings according to TriXX. I recommend getting a good quality PSU with at least 750W of power. Personally, I can attest to the fact the SeaSonic Focus GX-750 is more than capable of handling this card along with the rest of my build.

I also stongly recommend disabling FastBoot in Windows. FastBoot caused countless stability issues when in use for me as well as rendering TriXX unusable.

Now for the software/driver side of things. Sapphire's TriXX software is solid; it shows all the important metrics you want to see as well as allowing you to switch operating modes when you set the VBIOS selector to software/TriXX mode. It also let's you run a fan test, which is very helpful. This counts in the card's favor, as Sapphire makes this software for their product and is a feature.

AMD's drivers are another story. Adrenaline 2019 was decent near the end (with 19.12.1 being the best of 2019). Adrenaline 2020 was an unmitigated disaster. Everything you have read about how bad AMD's drivers are (19.12.2) are either true or an understatement. I went from a 98% stable system to a completely unusable system. It was at this time I thought about selling my wonderful Nitro+ and getting a 2070 Super. To AMD's credit, they pushed out a patched driver (19.12.3) a few days later that at least allowed me to use my system, but it was far from perfect. I had pretty decent luck with 20.1.1. 20.1.2 has been the most stable Radeon experience I've had since I bought this card a little over 3 months ago.

It is worth noting that I have FreeSync and Enhanced Sync disabled. The only Radeon feature I actually have enabled is Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS) at 80%. I found FreeSync and Enhanced Sync did not play well with my monitor (so I'm not sure if its an AMD issue or an MSI issue, as others have had success with this card and FreeSync with other monitors).

Overall, my experience with this card was not positive at first (it didn't help I had motherboard issues and went through multiple motherboards), but I have grown to absolutely adore this card and its performance. As AMD's driver support continues to mature for the Navi platform, the card is only going to get better. I'm also someone who doesn't mind jumping on a new driver as soon as it comes out to see what works, what breaks, and what has been improved.

In closing, while Sapphire and PowerColor are ""the"" Radeon cards to buy if you are going to go Radeon, Sapphire has created quite the gem with the Nitro+ RX 5700XT and was my choice over the Red Devil RX 5700XT. Driver issues notwithstanding (as neither Sapphire nor PowerColor can control this), I have zero regrets in that choice. Now on 20.1.2, I'm glad I didn't sell my 5700XT for a 2070S.

UPDATE 2020-03-27: The AMD 20.2.2 drivers resolved nearly every problem I had with the card. 20.3.1 is just as solid.

UPDATE 2020-07-24: This card continues to impress me; while I will still probably move it to another build when Big Navi is available, I feel less and less like this is something I need to do quickly as this card is aging extremely well (and getting better). I'm currently running the 20.7.2 drivers, Windows 10 2004 build, with the latest and greatest BIOS on my X570 MEG Unify at the time of this update."

I payed for a new card and I got a card that looked used and the middle fan made this strange chip scraping sound, (plenty of articles and videos showing this flaw) I contacted Sapphire tech about the fan and upon finally receiving a reply 3 days later they asked for a boatload of unnecessary system info, (which I provided) and they said they couldn't find a card under that SKU... ok nothing big, just ask them to look it up since it was a new purchase, waited two more days still nothing, finally after all this running around they told me to submit my information, WHICH THEY ALREADY HAD to yet another company, one that I assume will further destroy my drive to want a replacement fan sent to me and round and round we go...

However, as you'll see in the poor reviews the drivers from AMD aren't great yet. I did have issues with BSOD and stuttering. Wattman is a joke for the RX 5700/xt series. There is nothing wrong with the card. All the problems I'm having are due to the driver support from AMD. They are pushing them out and it's getting better but they aren't quite there yet. In time it will be flawless but keep it in mind that it is possible you will have these issues with any RX 5700/xt no matter the brand. That's not Sapphire's or any other AIB partners fault.

This is by far the best RX 5700 xt on the market."

That said this is an awesome cooler probably the best air cooling your going to get the next step up would be water. I've had 0 issues installing this this card basically plug and play. But that never good enuf for me so I tweaked it to find a good undervolt to help farther keep cooler and with fan speed of 45% and voltage 1.118v this card max load temp is 60-61c and cant hear it even with my ear to the case and no other sounds. Currently playing Conan Exiles and this is already a massive upgrade over my rx 470 which I had to turn down settings at 1080p for but this I just max the sliders and 60 no matter what I do but that's to be expected sents this card was ment for 1440p. Also like someone else said in the reviews dont buy from 3rd party companies they drain Amazons stocks to sell at a higher profit just wait and hope Amazon gets more in stock for $440 which I luck and and preordered before they hit Amazon shelves.

Edit: I added liquid metal to this thing as sapphire uses a copper plate on the die and temps maxes out at 59c and 73c hot spot! At 40%-50% fan speed. Definitely be careful and there are risks but I took precautions and put rubber tape over the mmm... things dont know the name that's by the die area so the liquid metal dont short them."

Right now I boosted the memory from 875 (1750 effective) to 900 (1800 effective) and extended the clock limit to 2150 and it routinely stays above 2000mhz with a 4% power limit boost. Plays World of Tanks (one of the only games I play much at the moment) at 4k max with anywhere between 70 and 105 fps. I just need to get more case fans to keep the case temperatures down. When playing WoT with the fans maxing out at 2000 rpm the edge temp is usually around 85C and the gpu temp is 64-65C. So far 19.9.2 is a stable and safe driver for the card at least in my experience. 19.9.10 can freeze when you try to adjust the clock maximum in Wattman, among other wonkyness."

And both you do not need this powerful of a graphics card for. left 4 dead 2 (a game that is literally over a decade old and I had to reinstall the AMD software for, now working) and league of legends (sometimes when the game is loading, the system becomes unstable and shuts down my computer, once in game has no issues. This has happened maybe about 10 times in 300+ games. My guess is this is due to the league anticheat and AMD software interacting)

The card runs my 1440p 144 hz monitor smooth as butter. A Freesync monitor and this card are an amazing duo.

Unless you want to play at 1440p or 4k, this card is overkill. If you are an esports gamer, I highly recommend looking at your budget and see if this is purely a vanity thing or if you actually have a use for this card.

Games I have tested:
Halo Master Chief Collection
Spyro Reignighted
Path of Exile
The Witcher 3
Jedi fallen order
Divinity original sin
Monster hunter world
Left 4 dead 2 (driver issues now fixed)
Shadow of the tomb raider
Shadow of war
League of legends (had issues with the drivers when loading the game and shutting down my computer)
Rainbow six siege
Doom (2016)
Fallout 4

AMD has fixed their drivers quite a bit, im going from a gigabyte 5700xt to this nitro+ 5700xt and i havent had any crashes or problems with either cards.

Bogus and debunked. Freesync issues most likely are user error or uncompatible monitor. I got this card to go with my amd 3700x cpu- 3200 cl14 ram - asus 550f gaming wi fi motherboard- coolermaster 500 case - 750watt evga psu.

System is completely air cooled using the stock prism cpu fan and temps on this card are very cool 50c idle 65-70 under gaming , and sometimes VR titles hit around 84c max which is nothing for this card. Amd officially says these cards can reach 100c and be fine. Don't even bother under volting this card otherwise buy a regular pulse you will just negate the whole reason to buy a nitro version.

I'm getting well over above average fps in everything that is out and ready to ROCK for cyberpunk!

If you think nvidia is a bunch of clowns overcharging for video cards you're correct.
Just a few short years ago a high end card was 350$ now they want 699! I don't think so, buy amd and never look back. Love the card, love the software! Team red is smoking hot atm and on fire!!!!"

Let's start with the bad. This card for some reason has stuttering issues with multiple games. It also crashes to desktop out of nowhere on 3 games. (Dirt rally, SOTR, Outer worlds) The anomaly is that it runs fine at a steady framerate until these issues occur. I replaced an Nitro RX580 that was a 5 star card that was nearly flawless for the price IMO. This card is considerably faster and runs most games I've tried at 3200x1800 on max or very high settings at 60fps. I am currently playing Jedi Fallen Order and while it has the stuttering issues, I havent had the crash issue. It doesnt run hotter than 65C and holds a steady framerate 99% of the time. Overall I can recommend this card but it does need some driver updates to fix these issues. For reference I'm running an AsRock Taichi X370 board with a Ryzen 1800x. 32gb ram at 2933mhz. Corsair 850w psu and a deep cool captain AIO cooler."

 I bought this card with high hopes and decided to ignore people's problems with it since there are always bad reviews on things. I had an older sapphire nitro that did me good for quite a while but it was time for an upgrade so this seemed like an amazing choice. All my stuff was old so ended having to fully upgrade. Got brand new TUF x570 Mobo, ryzen 5 3600, 16gb ram, and running on a 1440p monitor. I couldn't run on ultra in Destiny 2 or Borderlands 3. A lot of skipping so I had to turn down the graphics which is fine, not really a big deal. A few driver updates later and the card was getting worse and worse. It would just black screen and shut off games, if I pulled up Radeon overlay it would be artifacting like crazy. Non stop. (See video) I have tried everything. Using and driver uninstaller then reinstall. Using ddu. Resetting the card in the Mobo. Changing wires. Everything. Nothing worked. I am returning the card tomorrow, and my new Nvidia RTX 2080 will be arriving tomorrow as well. I had really high hopes for this card and also ignored the comments about it. I advise you don't make the same mistake. Do not get this card, at least not until they fix the drivers."

I have a mild OC with core clock and memory with a quiet and efficient fan curve. Temps. 68*c is the hottest it’s hit so far while being benchmarked or gaming. Currently have 1080p 240hz monitor and this monster works great with it. *fan curve is maxed at 85% at 70* but never gets that hot*

Valorant: 205fps avg. max settings. COD:MW 235fps avg. high settings. Fortnite: 265fps avg. medium/low settings. 180fps avg. mac settings. Pubg: 110fps avg: high settings GTA V: 120fps avg. max settings.

I can’t say one bad thing about the card. My drivers are working great with every game I throw at it. Current driver: 20.4.1

Recommend to anyone that what’s better FPS then most 1K cards with lower temps. Currently doing a comparison test to a evga 2080ti. So far it’s a 10-20fps difference but the 2080ti runs are 76*c avg. much hotter compared to the 5700xt with a 61* avg. I’m bummed I didn’t get this sooner. Will update on any changes."

Just swapped video cards and connected an additional PCI 8 pin power cord. Bit of a slow boot as system processed new configuration, but no issues. Updated to recommended driver (did not select option for latest/beta driver). At this date, I am using AMD driver 20.1.3.. Works perfectly. All games on Ultra settings, most with very little or no fan noise. Huge memory intensive games like ARK and Atlas push the card in 4K up to 90% of available performance with audible fan, but not annoyingly. As these two titles do not actually scale well to 4K, I am running them at 2K and can not tell much or any difference in sharpness of picture. Age of Empires redux with 4K retexture mod is an amazing joy - everything maxed. No problems or glitches whatsoever. Having read about driver issues, I was prepared to first try a safeboot removal of all old drivers and then install newest drivers. I was also prepared to do a fresh Windows 10 install. Neither procedure was necessary. My system is: Gigabyte GA 270X Ultra Gaming motherboard, i7 7700K cpu, 32gigs Ballistix Sport ram, air cooled. I also have a MacOS volume and may edit this review when I update my system to the 64bit only Metal2 capable Catalina release, as this Sapphire 5700XT is said to work with 10.15.2..

I game with a widescreen at 3440x1440 and needed extra power for Max settings and FPS and this bad boy delivers! I wanted the new RX 6800 XT but was sold out everywhere so I settled on this until I am able to buy one at stock price (F scalpers) but haven’t OC’d and extremely happy. I easily get over 60-90 FPS on COD: Modern Warfare full widescreen Max settings applied and full peripheral sights and have had no issues gaming last night got 3hrs straight. I did the auto GPU overclock today using the Radeon software but have not gamed on it heavily to make a determination on it being stable but others on YouTube have done it and claimed it was stable. I will say that the GPU has remained fairly cool and I only hear the fans kick onto medium every now and then but not like my old RX580 that had to kick on afterburner fans to keep up with my screen and settings. I definitely recommend this card for those making the jump from the same card. Lots of reviews show it’s right on the heels of an RTX 2070 and for me that’s good enough for my gaming setup.

The glowing lights are AMAZING. They are tasteful and subtle with beautiful rich coloring. It works like a dream slices through Ultra and 1080 with no issues (can go higher with ease but not for my use case). Also want to note I noticed flickering on some games (known issue) BUT noticed it may be more tied to my display as the flickering isn't found when streaming....

I'm part of a niche group. It would be cheaper to build a bulky PC but I don't want bulky. It will not be cheaper to build a tiny gaming PC yet (NUC!!). I also game wirelessly using steam link on TV throughout the house. I use my iMac for gaming via bootcamp (not ideal for everyone but I love it).

I bought a case for this card (chroma core x) to use it externally. Mostly to extend iMac's life and gain better efficiency. The case covers the beautiful card glow. Using thunderbolt 3 does bottleneck the card BUT not while streaming ultra at 1080 for me. I still get 60+ frames minimum (Final Fantasy 15 not so much). An external monitor is a must due to thunderbolt limitations. Note you do need to remove bootcamp AMD drivers (DDU) and simply put in modified ones for the card to be used. This will cause issues with internal monitor (can fix or not use internal display). Each mac setup yields different results you need to tailor to. You then have to select apps via display settings menu (graphics option-> Powerful Setting for each app added).

This card outperforms the AMD580 in windows with streaming or EXTERNAL monitor. It's just smoother with virtually no loading stutter that I've simply didn't notice or grown accustomed to. Using internal monitor didn't yield much better results. Using it on Mac side is literally plug and play but didn't give me the performance windows did. I only tested Tombraider.

Computer stays cooler and card has a pleasant purr when fans are on full blast. AMD will be making Playstation and Xbox cards with ray tracing (current lineup doesn't have.) Once the newer AMD cards drop this year and drivers are ready I'll be swapping this one out! This card has made me a believer in AMD with strong and affordable technology. So far I love her and feel it was a great deal compared to competition!"

Specs look awesome for the money. Really wanted to move into fourth gen PCIE. I'm running an Aorus x570 Elite WiFi motherboard with an AMD 3600 CPU. I thought my ALL AMD setup would run smooth as butter. Not the case...

After POSTing a good, clean system I updated all my components to the latest drivers. Everything looked great until I installed the Radeon software and driver for the 5700XT. That's when everything went South. Crazy screen flickering, black screens, crashes. I couldn't even get into a game to see how it looked. I tried every workaround and fix I could find for two weeks. Nothing could get my desktop to a functioning state. I had to go into safe mode just to roll back.

I ended up putting in a 1080ti and the system has run like a champ since I booted it up. I guess I'll be team green until AMD puts out a flagship GPU that has working drivers and runs right out of the box.

It's unfortunate they're working on RDNA2 before sorting out these issues with RDNA. I'll be here waiting AMD. I still love you, and I miss... I just want you to stop hurting me.

Instillation was seamless, no need to uninstall/reinstall drivers since I was upgrading from an older Nvidia card. When running in OC mode, it will boost to over 2000 mhz, and I have yet to see it get too far over 70 C when under load. I am using a 2k/165hz monitor, so this card is more than enough to run games at max settings and still get high frame rates. When some more demanding games come out, I will have to see how well it handles them. Runs pretty quiet, even when under load, but there is some fan noise. It is nothing horrible, at least for me. I use headphones, and will sometimes have the TV on, so I don't notice the noise that much.

Overall, this is a solid card that was worth paying the extra $30 for the custom cooler and factory overclock, even if the memory was not overclocked. Also, you should not pay more than $530 for this card, any higher and it is probably a scalper. If you cannot wait for a restock, you can try somewhere else.

Finally, unless otherwise specified, when I bough this, Amazon was not participating in the Nvidia game bundle. I emailed Nvidia about this, as someone in the Q/A section indicated that doing so would get you the game code, but the Nvidia rep said that was not the case. If you want the game bundle, you might need to look somewhere else. I don't remember seeing other Nvidia products with game bundles on Amazon, but that does not mean they do not appear form time to time."

Had an issue early on with it shutting down during gaming. Thought the card was dying. Turns out that one of the washers for my CPU Cooler unscrewed and fell somewhere down the case. The caused a power short on the motherboard. Now that I've screwed it in properly, its been completely stable. I'm giving this card 4 stars and not 5 because for the immense thickness and apparent ventilation, the somewhat open shroud, as well as two fairly large fans the temperatures are just average. 70 - 75 on heavy load in room temperature. Not bad and not amazing. Everything else is fine.

RTX is still somewhat of a gimmick. Control is the only game that shows a noticeable difference between RTX on and off, mainly just for the reflections and the performance in that game is sub par so it's STILL not worth it. The global illumination is still a joke to me. You lose 40-50% of your FPS in Metro Exodus and you would be hard pressed to notice the difference and actually point it out WITHOUT comparing screenshots. Take RTX off and enjoy 100+ fps in most games. This card is actually pretty powerful on its own. If you have a high refresh rate monitor it gets the job done. Beware though, many games still struggle to push high frame rates (80+). Many times you'll see your performance tank, its most likely the game engine as the GPU usage will be no where near 100%."

Can easily be overclocked to 1845 MHz using ASUS GPU Tweak II. However, I had two issues setting up the card. The first was screen flickering to black under high load. Make sure you change the global power management mode in NVIDIA Control Panel to Prefer Maximum Performance to fix this problem. Additionally, the fans on the card are a bit noisy when they turn on and off, which normally wouldn’t be a problem. However, ASUS GPU Tweak II automatically turns on 0db mode upon installation, which causes the fans to turn off below a temperature threshold of ~54 C. But since the card runs at that temperature most of the time, the fans constantly turn on and off, making a horrible grinding noise and probably damaging the fans. Make sure you turn off 0db mode if you choose to overclock with ASUS GPU Tweak II, it’s not like you can really hear the fans spinning at 20% anyway. Additionally, for the first week of usage the card had some pretty noticeable coil whine, but this went away gradually as it was used. The card looks like a beast and performs like one too, however there is a magenta/cyan lighting strip on the front of it that you can’t change or turn off.

To say a graphics card can change your life sounds a little bit crazy. But upgrading to an ASUS RTX 2070 SUPER O8G from an ASUS GTX 1050TI HAS changed my life. After the initial shock of newly found graphical clarity in games like COD Warzone and RDR2, I find myself way more RELAXED while playing my favorite games. Whereas before, on my 1050TI, I felt like I was always rushed and stressed while playing games that required higher graphical fidelity than my graphics card could render, overclocked or not. I found myself running on 1600x900 resolution just to keep my FPS above 60. It was more stressful at times than fun, and a lot of my time was spent tinkering with it just to make it run properly.

I'm going to game, whether I'm running onboard graphics... or I'm rocking a Titan. Owning an ASUS RTX 2070 SUPER O8G has been a huge quality of life improvement. I mention the O8G specifically to distinguish it from the A8G which, from my research, is overclocked to a lesser degree. If you aren't interested in overclocking, this is a superior card to the A8G because it's overclocked to a higher degree out of the box.

I also find this product appealing because a 2070 SUPER GPU is the sweet spot for price to performance.

TESTING

I've found that the product stays cool under full load at about 68 celcius. No problems with FPS. Perfect for high refresh rate monitor. This is testing with games like RDR2 and COD Warzone. If you intend on using this for such games, I find no reason to spend any more.

Lastly, it looks cool. I'm impressed with the build quality of the surrounding plate and dual-fan cooling solution. I was also pleasantly surprised by the sleek purple and blue RGB strip along the side plate."

All I wanted was a GPU from a name brand that will pin that FPS in most every game at very high/ultra settings. I got that. This is a 2080 97% of the time. As long as you can recoup some money buy selling your old GPU, it can be a sub $300 upgrade with a FPS massive impact as it was in my case. Finally RTX made some sense with Super. Easily the best cost/performance release of the 2000 series for 1440p and even mild 4K gaming, with the 2060 Super admirably nipping at its heels in much less GPU demanding games at 1440p, and easily the best card for very high FPS at 1080p. The Super series is very good at the MSRP.

The LED strip might as well not exist as you cannot program it. It's a solid pastel blue and pink. Something out of 1980's Miami which you might like. I dont mind it as I was actually alive back then and love art deco, but I'd be fine with no LED at all. Feels forced by Asus and ultimately pointless.

Solid build. One review said the backplate was plastic? It's aluminum. Thicc card that doesn't sag even with an older Z97 motherboard."

Most normal height GTX and RTX Gaming Video cards are too tall preventing the cover over the bus area to be closed.

Installation was simple and the card works very nicely for DAZ Studio renders, and very well for Topaz AI programs including the newest Video Enhance AI which can vastly improve quality of videos (reduce noise and increase resolution (e.g from 640x480 to 1920x1080 HD, 4k, up to 8k).

At this point in time (Feb 2020) the RTX 2070 Super video cards probably give you the most processing power for the money. Although the much more expensive models 2080 Ti and higher are more powerful, they cost dis-proportionally higher, while the less powerful RTX 2060 and below which are cheaper are significantly less powerful.

Update: I also purchased a PNY brand version of this card which appears identical but costs a bit less. They both work very well."

Running Minecraft Ray tracing with SUES PTGEI9 shaders at 60fps and 32 chunks with MINIMAL lag, only reaching 45fps in intense areas and only uses 60% of the GPU (Which means you can record seamlessly).

The 8GB VRAM IS A GOD SEND FOR VR, if you plan on getting or play VR GET THIS CARD!!! VRChat NEVER has any issues anymore, even with crasher avatars (which overload your GPU with intense shaders to crash you).

THE DUAL BALL BEARING FAN ON THIS GRAPHICS CARD IS AMAZING IF YOU OVERCLOCK THE GPU OR JUST THE FAN, BUT IS LOUD WHEN OVERCLOCKED! Running the most intense benchtest with the fan speed OVERCLOCKED to 100% and the GPU itself by 88%, the GPUs heat remained a steady 48*C for me due to my fan setup. Impressive! I mainly use this overclock for VR games or rendering videos.

Comes with a software suite to fine tune to your liking, giving statistical graphs and readings within a 0.5 second delay. As stated above, overclocking, overclocking, overclocking. Why use MSI afterburner when the ASUS suite literally allows you edit and visualize everything? Comes with a scan that determines the best overclocking for your PC so you don't damage it yourself too. Silent running is great, but expect poor preformance obviously when in it. Do I say more?

Overall Rating : This is the best GPU for your buck at the current time. Not too expensive and just the right amount of power. Good job ASUS! If only your phones were just as good."

Not a slouch compared to 2080,I thoroughly recommend the super series product. I almost purchased the standard 2080 last year but decided to wait for the next grouping of products to come out and I was glad I did. The price point is great for something that will give you just as good as the 2080 for a few hundred dollars cheaper. Runs everything I can throw at it on ultra settings. Some people have complained about the coil whine but I have not had this issue it is a light background noise which is not noticeable when you have headphones or speakers on. Temperatures hover about 46 Celsius in desktop and maybe get to 60 Celsius in a GPU dependent game. One thing I do wish it came with a bracket to support the weight of it. As this is a large card. Has no problem fitting in a mid size ATX case from NZXT. In fact we have room to spare. I would recommend this to any aspiring gamer who wants an upgrade. The nvidia drivers installed easily enough. The ray tracing on it is OK. It's not something highly noticeable. I'm sure the future will bring even more goodies that the RTX series will thrive with. I did not notice a HDMI port which would've been nice but I use display ports anyway. Just the ability to plug it into an HDMI TV would've been a bonus I suppose. Aspiring gamers go for it. Asus has your back.

Even with Ultra settings on the newest games you get a minimum fps around 60-80fps+ at 1440p. Though, you will probably need to sacrifice and lower a few graphics settings like reflections or anti-aliasing to save some frames. If you're looking to truly max out ALL settings you'll have to go with a 2080ti.

Pricing
I reasoned this GPU was worth it over the 2060 super in performance for a slight increase in cost, and worth the savings for slightly less performance compared to the 2080 super.

Coil Whine
This is really the only thing that disappoints me with this Graphics Card. I can't be sure if it's the ASUS modifications or just an innate aspect of the 2070 super, but there is very noticeable coil whine during high-use graphics (anything maximizing your GPU). Things like RDR2, GTA, super-modded Skyrim, and even large (well, massive) Photoshop files can cause coil whine that syncs with your in-game/program actions--think turning your character in Skyrim you hear a whine, but during loading screens it goes away entirely then comes back after you've loaded. If you wear headphones at a decent volume you probably won't even notice. I use stereo speakers and can tune it out for the most part, but it's still there.

Overall, I'd recommend this GPU for someone with a higher-end build looking for 1440p 144hz gaming who can tolerate and accept coil whine for the sake of great performance."

I finally figured it out what was going on with Chill and games like Borderlands 2. It has to do with how Steam tags the game. Steam games are tag with an ID number. So, when AMD Settings auto scans for games, it picks up the Steam ID number and not path the games .EXE file is at. Why does this matter? I don't normally use Steam to start the games. I use a short cut to start the game. So, AMD Setting Chill does not think you started the game, hence it doesn't do it's magic of limiting frame rate, which then lowers the watts usage and temperature. I start the game using Steam then Chill works like a charm. Sorry, there really is no manual for AMD Settings. I just looked around the internet and trail and error. Hopefully my ranting in this type of forum helps you decide on buying a AMD or a Nvidia.

As an update on some metrics after I figured out Chill:
Destiny 2. 68-75 FPS, 45-50 Watts, 65-68 C, 1600rpm
Elite Dangerous: Horizons. Very consent 75FPS. 45-50 Watts, 55-60C, 600-700rpm.

Update 18 Jan 2019: The AMD Performance Overlay doesn't really play well with games. Sometimes the hotkey works and sometimes it doesn't. However, what I found out is that AMD Software has a great feature called AMD Link. (Privacy Warning: This feature requires data of your graphics card and what you are doing to AMD Servers) . Your graphics card send performance data to the AMD Servers and using your smart device (phone or pad) with the occupying AMD Link App, you can watch different performance metrics while playing a game. The metrics are almost real time (every 1 sec) and it provides me FPS, GPU Utilization, GPU Fan Speed, GPU Temp, and GPU Power. There are other metrics that it can provide like CPU Utilization but there is only so much screen real estate on a iPhone. If you want to keep historical records, there is a capture feature in the app. If you don't mind the privacy issues, this is a good app.

Update 24 Dec 2018: So I had the Vega for about 2 weeks and realize that there is a lot of tweaking to optimize game play. If you like tweeking with the settings then AMD is the way to go. If you want more of a plug and play, you may want to go Nvidia. An example is Destiny 2 (this is the game I am playing the most right now). At default settings, using the performance overlay that comes with AMD, it was using 90% GPU utilization, hitting about 70 degree celsius, the fan speed was about 2000+ rpm and using about 200 watts. After tweaking the settings of the driver (Chill at 57-80 fps, enhance sync on, freesync on) and turning off v-sync in game settings, the Vega was using about 40-50% GPU Utilization, 56-60 degrees celsius, about 57-100 watts and was getting about 65-72 fps (Freesync was making everything smooth. No tearing or stutters). So tweaking the settings allowed the GPU to work less but provide the same amount of FPS. BTW I tried tweaking Borderlands 2 and it does not run very well. I have a feeling that Borderlands 2 was programed around Nvidia. Heck, the opening screen is the Nvidia logo. So it will max the AMD GPU just to get 50-60 fps.

I didn't really need to upgrade my currently GTX 980ti. However, I paired the GTX with a LG Widescreen Monitor, 1080p, with Free-sync. When I initially put together my computer, I was moving from a Mac so I was not really educated on Free sync or G-Sync. What I wanted was a Widescreen Monitor to allow me to have several windows open when writing papers. As with most PC users, I started to gravitating into playing video games. So, I had a choice of upgrading my monitor to a Widescreen with G-Sync or buy a AMD Radeon. G-Sync monitors in general are expensive and Widescreen are even more expensive. Reviews on Vega 64 would say it was comparable to the GTX 1080. However, I would say it was more comparable to the GTX 980ti / GTX 1070. Anyway, long story short, the MSI Vega 64 drop in price to about the GTX 1070 price range for a very short period so I bought one. As a note my first choice was the ASUS Vega 64 but at $750, yea... No!

Installation: Not hard. Pulled out the GTX 980ti and plugged in the Vega 64. I didn't uninstall the Nvidia drivers or Nvidia software prior to installing the Vega 64. Not sure if this is common to all computers, but it took a long time for my computer to boot initially (about 5 mins). This could be because the computer was trying to load the Nvidia drivers or had to install the windows generic video drivers but I was worried because of the long blank screen. I thought I got a DOA card. The next was to download the most current drivers which was Radeon Adrenalin 2019. Then I uninstall all the Nvidia software. Re-boot (which was much faster than the initial) and off I went.

Performance wise, it is about in par with my GTX 980ti. (Note: I had V-Sync turn off and did not cap the FPS. Reading discussion on the internet is not very conclusive of if Vsync should be turn on or off. Also, not sure if capping the frame rate to the monitors max refresh should be done)
Destiny 2 is a bit slower FPS (72-75), max settings. GTX 980ti consistent 75 FPS
Elite Dangerous - the same 75 FPS, max settings
Watch Dog - about the same 110 FPS, max settings
Borderlands 2 - This was all over the place, 52-106 FPS, max settings. GTX 980ti gave a consistent 75 FPS. However, I think Free-Sync was working because it was still very smooth as the FPS fluctuated. (Note: Borderlands 2 was optimized for Nvidia)
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - 100-108 FPS, max settings. GTX 980ti gave a consistent 75 FPS. (Also optimized for Nvidia)

I have more games but in general the Vega 64 is about on par with my GTX 980ti. Did I need to upgrade? No, hence the 3 stars. The move to Vega 64 was not eye shattering different. However, it satisfied my itch on Free-Sync, the price was right $400, and I got 3 new games (has not been released yet) games ($160 value). Depending on the value you put on the games, the cost of the card drops to about $250. If I had to buy the games, the only one I would consider getting is Division 2. However, Devil May Cry 5 and Resident Evil 2 don't seem like bad games.

Other notes: The one fan blower is somewhat loud. It doesn't bother me because the HyperX Cloud Alpha headphones does a really good job blocking outside noise. Most gaming session will get the fan spinning at 2200 rpm and hit about 77c temp. I haven't used Wattman yet to boost performance so my results above is using baseline settings."

The GPU I purchased in this review was one of many carefully selected components to complete my new system. This system has two requirements:

1. 27"" 4k IPS @ 3840x2160
2. Over the top components, exception being GPU. I only play a single game, Starcraft 2 (Release date of 2010) on lowest graphics.

This MSI card gets about 150 fps average @ 3840x2160 on this system in Starcraft 2. However, randomly the card will lock up to a black screen, hard halt the OS (WIN10 PRO 1809) and crash. Everything from a new PSU to drivers and prayers were attempted. This MSI Radeon 280RX 8GB keeps crashing.

MSI RMA process has been a joke. Paying 10% of the original value of the card (about 20 USD$) to send RMA, I was shocked to see the same exact card returned back to me. No notes from the repair in the packing material, no notes on the electronic RMA portal. Just the same card with the same problem.

Sitting here with a 200$ paper weight, dealing with broken customer service RMA processes. Really bad experience, stay away."

This is merely to target their technical support as I am unable to really get the full extent of this card as I've received the same terrible RMA support negating my concern of my PC being afflicted with black screen without noise and black screen with a loud noise with no way on how to troubleshoot, the popular blue screen with errors of DRIVERS_IRQL_EQUAL_OR_LESS on pci.sys file, fuzzy-static-like picture on display then crashing to instead listen to the spokesman tell me they do not support Windows 7 64 bit when on their website they do in fact support it and have the drivers to download and install then proceeded to tell me the Ryzen 5 2nd generation I got doesn't officially support the OS when AMD's website has support for it as well with his insistence to get Windows 10 as if I was talking to somebody at Microsoft. I won't forget how he proceeded to tell me his years of building PC's too as if that means anything to me. Add all that with an attitude while another guy I couldn't even understand what he was saying to me... I would recommend folks grab the 1-2 year extended warranty to just get a replacement and not deal with MSI's shaddiness that is their Customer Service Support at all cost.

I sincerely tried to support AMD financially with a Ryzen 5 2nd gen, this graphic card, and an MSI B350M Gaming Pro by not following the zombie crowd of Intel and NVIDIA. Now, maybe I just won't help anything done by MSI.

All of this has been occurring within the same month of purchase (Aug 2, 2018) to now Nov 13, 2018 without an end in site. I've gone days to weeks without a crash only due to changing my single 8 GB Crucial RAM to another slot to days with multiple crashes (on the same slot I changed it to weeks ago) and all of this is towards a person who is building their very first custom PC... So unless I am able to correct all of the above this has been not only a waste of purchase for this card but the entire build which might be over $500... my 10 year old G33/G31 Express Chipset Family PC from HP is more reliable."

However, three times during install it would stop and say the firmware needs to be updated, just follow instructions on the screen. Finally it loaded 10.13.6 (I guess it got all the firmware updates it needed). Now System shows Metal=Yes! I can now download Mojave. Oh, I did need to order a Display Port to Display Port cable as this card does not take the mini-DP to DP cable I had.
Bottom line: probably the CHEAPEST solution you can find to upgrade to Metal and Mojave. I just use Photoshop and Lightroom so it more than meets my needs."

msi RX 570 Armor 8g OC ( generation 2 )
newer boards have 2 HDMI , 2 DP , 1 DVI-D
( BIOS March 2018 )

One 8 pin power connector . board length 10.6 inches .
about 2 pounds ( 892 grams )
2048 Stream precesses ( half that of the new RX 5700 )
224 Gig Bytes of memory bandwidth RX 570 .
448 Gig Bytes of memory bandwidth RX 5700 .
RX 570 170
RX 5700 350
RX 570 half price for half the performance , at about the same power .

Below details setup and game use :

quiet fans , 5 watts when on desk top .
runs at a max temperature of about 74 C under full load .
Temperature can be less when making custom wattman profiles .
room temperture plays a factor with GPU temperature .

Max power is about 106 watts under full load using
default voltage values .
When under-Volting , max power is about 96 watts
under full load .

How to keep it cool :
Back Plate radiates a lot of heat .
to keep the case inside cool , a fan ( 3 inches or so ) can be
set on top of the GPU Back Plate , with the Fan blowing\venting
straight out to room environment . Cass temperature is now
normal . Mother board and video card have temperatures as expected .
The card has massive ( 2 fans and heatsink ) but no venting to
outside of case ( You must find a way to Fan Vent the case )
Stays cool best when the Fans have direct access to ambient air
intake , while Fan venting the case to ambient room .
( Shrouds might help , not using shrouds here )

Back Plate can get warm . Keep ALL cables OFF the back plate .
Heat will eventually soften the rubber sheething and ruin the cables.

custom wattman profiles :

GPU 1165 Mhz at 900 mV , Memory 1750 Mhz at 900 mV
( Under-clocked and under-volted , 60 watts at 60 C , ( this is my main use game profile )
or
GPU 1400 Mhz at 1100 mV , Memory 1400 Mhz at 765 mV
( overclocked , 85 watts at 71 C )
or
GPU 1400 Mhz at 1100 mV , Memory 2100 Mhz at 1000 mV
( overclocked , 96 watts at 74 C )
or
GPU 300 Mhz at 750 mV , Memory 300 Mhz at 750 mV
( desktop use , 5 watts fans OFF , at 30 C to 39 C )
or
use their ""Default"" : auto ramps GPU from 300 Mhz to 1286 Mhz .

Note :
all of my custom profiles set GPU ""State 1"" min = max
all of my custom profiles set Memory ""State 2"" min = max
Thus ALL frequencies operate at ""Fixed Frequency"" No ramp up\down .

ReLive recordings :
4k at 30 fps
2k at 60 fps
press Ctrl-Shift-R anytime to start\stop recording .
only have a 1080p monitor\TV ? you can still record in 4k .
use SVR ( Super Virtual Resolution )
( if you have a 4k monitor\TV , SVR has No purpose )

When using SVR with your 1080p monitor\TV ,
turn SVR On in Radeon ""Display"" Tab Settings .
( i recommend a reboot after SVR is turned ON\OFF )

when in game menu , you now have 3840 x 2160 resolution choice .
all GPU processing occurs at 3840 x 2160 , then the output to the
Frame Buffer is down scaled to 1080p for your 1080p monitor\TV .

When pressing Ctrl-Shift-R , the game will now record using the
GPU internal 4k processing .
you can game at 4k and record at 4k , while using a 1080p monitor .
or
you can choose to stay at 1920 x 1080 game resolution and record at 1080p .
processing still occurs at 4k inside GPU . Something of a hardware Super-Sampling mode .
or
keep SVR OFF , and ( play and record ) at 1080p , on your 1080p monitor\TV .

Recordings are ( h.264 or h.265 ) to .mp4 your choice . Audio has perfect sync .
bit rate slider max at 100 Mbps .
Recommend using AMD HDMI audio sound device when recording .
.mp4 imports into Vegas 14 or newer for HEVC h.265 .

Want to record the desk top at 4k , on your 1080p monitor\TV ?
yes you can . With SVR ON , now go into window' Settings and
and set Display properites to 3840 x 2160 . All desk top processing
now occurs at 4k inside the GPU , while the desk top is scaled down to 1080p .
Screen captures and recordings are Full Quality 4k .
The desk top fonts may take on a slight fuzz because of the down sampling
to 1080p however , the desktop 4k recordings come from the GPU at Full quality 4k .

Whenever windows display resolution is set to 4k\2k , i recommend a reboot .

Radeon Overlay :
Radeon Settings , click ""Preferences"" Tab at bottom of Home Screen ,
click ""Show Overlay"" . Overlay is now available but NOT yet visible .
Now press ALT-R to show the full overlay Menu .
or
press Ctrl_Shift-o , to view GPU stats .

Dying Light does NOT like the showing GPU stats( overlay )
when in SVR using 4k in game menu . the AMD driver will crash .
( for normal gaming , keep ALL overlays OFF , ""Show Overlay"" OFF )

passive Speed boost performance smoothness increase .
""Shadow Map"" in game setting :
do NOT use AA .
Blur is ok to have ON .
Moti0n Blur is the Continious Bluring as you move ( i keep this OFF )

Dying Light , reduce Shadow Map from ""Very High"" to ""High""
All remaining settings can be ON to the max , including
Nvidia post processing . runs nice at 1080p .

""Witcher 3"" , reduce Shadow Map from ""Ultra"" to ""High""
panning is now smooth at 1080p .

DOOM 2016 with Vulkan API , does NOT seem to have
Shadow Map size issues .
thus Shadow Map ""Nightmare"" works just fine at 1080p .

8 gig VRAM is plenty to access max Shadow Map size ,
but , causes too much pixel processing on the GPU
to determine which pixels are found to be ""in shadow""
and than to paint each pixel that were found to be
""in shadow"" to black\gray value ."

The card was ""Sold by: Amazon.com Services, Inc"" just to make sure that I wasn't getting a potential opened or used product figured Amazon wouldn't tamper with it any. Well that turns out not to be the case and this isn't the first time this has happened to me.

I ordered this product with a few other things. They all came in the same box and the big box was sealed. So mail people didn't tamper with it. I open it up and the graphics card box is the top one. It isn't in any sealing plastic or anything and one of the box latches was open. That was suspicious. So I open it up and check everything inside. Everything looks to be there. Pull out the graphics card in it's static proof plastic bag to look at it. Flip over the bag and see the sealing tape was messed with that it was taken off and then put back on with pieces of it ripped off and put on another part holding nothing. Means someone had opened and taken out the graphics card. This product was definitely not New then, but was sold as such. This is the second time while buying an electronic directly from Amazon this has happened. Everything else seems fine. The product is seemingly working okay at the moment. Will update if through running tests something is off.
That's the reason for the Overall being a 3 out of 5.

Easy to Install 4/5
Reason being is that with my chassis design the ports for onto the chassis the auto-locking mechanism to secure things on the PCI ports would not work due to the metal at the ports on the graphics card bumping into each other. Had to use screws instead. It's a large card so if you have a small case this will probably not fit. It fit well into my Full ATX. The AMD Software I am having issues with so that's another reason for the star off.

For Gaming 4/5.
There are better cards out there on the market thus taking a star off. For the price it's pretty good.

For Beginners 5/5
Pretty easy to get everything set up in it if your computer can support all aspects of it. This might deserve a star off since a complete newbie might not have all the right cables in their case, know how to check what ports they have, etc. MSI has some good documentation in there to help you, but all the documentation in the world won't help you if your pc doesn't have the right parts in it or size to fit it."

I was personally able to overclock the core clock of this card to 1425MHz using MSI Afterburner with no problems. Just a heads up, this card gets hot. Normal temps under full load/bench-marking are between 57-61Celsius. I would suggest installing MSI Afterburner asap and setting your own fan control speed. My personal settings are fan speeds 40-60-80-100% speed for gpu temps 30-40-50-60Celsius. This will ensure that your power supply isn't overly stressed and that you will have the cooling you need under a full load. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and intend to purchase a 2nd gpu to run a crossfire setup with a 2k resolution 144hz monitor. If you're looking for a 8gb gpu at a budget, you found it."

I know the RX 580 works but is nearly double the price of the 570 with relatively similar specs (and the 570 is way better than my stock GPU from 2010!)

I received the card, plugged it in and used 1 auxiliary power port on the mother board (which is the same setup as the original Radeon graphics card) and it powered up fine, no drivers needed, and no issues whatsoever.

Because this card isn't made for Mac you won't see the boot screen so keep your original card in case you ever need that, but otherwise this worked great.

You will also need to purchase an 8pin to mini-6pin cable to connect into the power on the motherboard.

I don't do any gaming but do a fair bit of Garage Band and iMovie, as well as some graphics intensive video production. This card handles it fine and is good value for the money.

I wish it had two HDMI ports as I had to buy a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter but the output is crisp and clean either way.

Highly recommend if you are a Mac Pro user wanting to upgrade at a lower cost."

I'm not much for PC gaming, though I do use Steam sometimes, and I still had Diablo 3 installed.

I did a bit of research before buying this, bouncing between Nvidia and AMD. I didn't want a card that needed a crazy PSU to run, and I really wasn't looking to spend a ton of money. The specs between this and comparable cards weren't significantly different enough to make me dig too deep. Figuring my CPU is AMD, and my mainboard is MSI, I opted to keep it all in the family.

Install was as simple as could be, for a video card. After loading the software and getting a couple updates, I'm happy to say I was able to run Outer Worlds at Ultra settings without issue. I also loaded Steam, Far Cry 4, and it also ran flawlessly at the highest settings. I checked out a few more games I had that ran just ok on my old card, and they were all fantastic.

Not a big deal. The bottom line is the GPU works great with two monitors with DP connections. Not a gamer so I couldn't say anything about games, but streaming MLB games: perfect! I'm happy. VisionTek customer service gets 5 stars.

UPDATE! Originally 4 stars now downgraded to 1. I left the original post so you could see I was pretty happy. After a few days of operation, though, the card caused enough problems with Win 10 that I had to reinstall the operating system. Not one to be beat I worked with the card through 5 re-installs of Win 10 (I'm really good at that now). Netflix froze the computer on every launch of the program. Also, boot and emerging from sleep issues. Using an ASRock Z77 Extreme4 motherboard with i7 processor. Different card now works great. My update now is that this card definitely has compatibility issues with Win 10."

I physically installed the card, plugged in the monitors, powered up and didn't have to do much of anything else.

The above is listed in the product description. No cables were included.

You can tell MFG quality is off as labels on the card are placed crooked. I work in manufacturing so I know the aesthetics don't always match the electronics so I don't fault for that too much.

Heading out to get DisplayPort cables. We'll see what happens now because I'm supposed to use the included cables for 4K resolutions apparently...and that's a big miss.

Update: The card is installed and works fine. Not using it for heavy graphics or dual head so can't rate that. But the fact that it works on Linux and has given enough resource boost makes me move from 1 star to 3 stars."

Upon discovering that the outputs were display ports I was initially disappointed and wanted to return it simply because none of my monitors supported DP as an input. Instead I ended up buying an adapter and used it for my 65"" 4K multimedia display. The results are awesome. Very crisp and fast enough for most applications. Had to upgrade the cpu memory to 20gigs though to handle 4k streaming and gaming with less effort. (especially with 2 screens) Overall though, this is a great entry level 4k card and handling normal 36"" or less UHD loads should be a breeze."

This card took awhile to load the drivers needed to bring up graphics on both monitors. I then went out to get the latest version of the Radeon Adrenalin software, and during that installation process, had it remove whatever drivers had been installed by Windows (this also took some time to complete). Once done, both monitors have run flawlessly so far at a refresh rate of 75Hz and 2560x1440 resolution. I have had a couple of flickers, but overall a good card.

Now to the bad. I put this graphics card into a Shuttle enclosure I use as my main PC. To say this card is loud is an understatement. It has significantly increased the white noise coming from the case from barely audible to a constant hum. This fan continues to run at 100% just to keep the temp at 45C. By contrast, my one case/processor fan on the I.C.E. module runs at 1100rpm to maintain the same CPU core temps.

My bottom line, decent card for the price, just not for a quiet machine."

I game on 3440x1440, and it runs everything at max without issue and really high frame rates. I'm not heavily into benchmarking, but last time I ran it through Timespy at +178 on the Core clock without issue. It will boost over 2200Mhz.

It can't be understated how hefty this thing is. I knew they were large GPUs, but when I got it I was still a bit shocked. lol It's a serious piece of hardware. Probably weighs 5lbs. I have a Corsair 280x, and managed to wrangle it in there by removing my bottom fans and some cable hyjinx. I went ahead and ordered a Lancool II Mesh, as it now occupies about 25% of my case. lol But, it works amazingly well. I'd highly recommend it if you can get your hands on one.

Oh, also of note: It has dual BIOS, so you can set it to normal with a really conservative/quiet fan curve, or OC mode. You can download updated firmware and OC bios at EVGA's website, upping the power draw max to 450W. EVGA is a US company, and also has pretty much the best warranty and customer service in the business, which are a few other good reasons I went with this one."

It was also, according to the UPS label, sent out by another very large, reputable on-line electronics retailer. I guess this is how they sell products on the down low as to not garner the wrath of Nvidea. Still the price was only $100 more than I sold my 2080ti for so I’m not mad at it.

My personal use is in a r710 server that has a very low power limit draw on the pci-e power cables available. This one comes in at 20W and requires no external power. Perfect. The ability to remove the VGA port and go low-profile is nice but you have to be really dedicated to completely removing the port and cable. It requires removing the heatsink so most people may just leave it hanging. It's doing duty for me as a Windows 10 VM GPU and does the job just fine. For reference I can play Minecraft fine thought it feels like it may be at the limit. Will it run Crysis? Well... I have Crysis 2 and you can ""technically"" play it. maybe 10fps though. I tried a smattering of others as well. Mirrors Edge was just barely playable. Audiosurf worked fine. Cities Skylines on low settings was playable just not with a huge framerate. And why not try no mans sky..? Or don't, unusable on lowest settings. I think anyone knows you wont be playing current games with this but I mention this as an FYI just in case. If you have some low-end low-power needs, this could be a good option. Older games like Command and Conquer are fine and if you just need something passable without using integrated graphics this could definitely work. Just set the correct expectations."

My last of the Geforce series was a long time ago with the 5200 FX model. I was pleasantly surprised how smoother gaming became compared to the results from Intel Graphics. Some of my more demanding Steam games ran at an especially improved pace. I also have a Nvidia 2070. When I run Metal Gear Re-vengeance on all 3 cards , the performance of the Geforce GT 710 lands right in the middle spectrum even with overclocking. I ran a benchmark using Resident Evil 5 and it does not get an “S “or higher in rating if that's even possible, triple “S “being the highest possible rating. Two gigs is plenty of memory and especially when combined with your system's ram.

There is some visual tearing on larger open world games, especially if your controlled character moves at faster speeds than can be drawn in. The card comes with every popular way to plug in a screen from VGA, DVI to HDMI (1 port each). I would say the card is totally worth the money for starter gamers who cannot afford a big rig just yet; this card can meet expectations on the fun factor. This card won't necessarily provide ultra-high settings on all aspects of the most demanding games but the improvements it will provide are well-worth the investment."

Essentially just needed a basic display adapter to be able to configure and monitor the server. This does the trick without any drivers even in FreeNAS.
The fact that it supports VGA, DVI and HDMI is useful since I was able to drive my VGA monitor without needing an adapter. I also like that its passively cooled because my NAS is typically close to silent so this keeps the theme going.

This isn't by any means a powerful GPU so you shouldn't purchase it for any gaming or anything else like that. Its made specifically to be a display adapter for your desktop or to watch movies/shows. This card uses DDR3 which really is slower than integrated graphics in most modern day APU's. However if you don't have an APU and need a GPU; this does the trick!

Slap an old SSD, extra ram, a cheap grey market copy of Windows 10 and a wireless keyboard and mouse and you have a decent little machine for basic web browsing.

But I often find myself doing routine cleaning and repair tasks in complete silence so I get to thinking I could probably watch/listen to something on Netflix or Hulu on my computer while doing this but the I found that my hand me down machine's integrated GPU struggles with streaming HD video.

I got this because it has a low profile bracket and a VGA output which is labeled as ""CRT"" on the bracket.

Even though it comes with a low profile bracket for the VGA port it physically won't fit properly in a low profile computer case. My monitor also has a DVI input so thankfully that issue was averted but you need to know just in case you wanted to use the VGA port on a low profile computer like I did.

Additionally the VGA port is removable but only if you alao remove the heatsink and that's not something I'm keen on doing right now as it might also require reapplying the thermal paste. So now it just dangles inside my case.

Doesn't include a driver CD which makes sense because whatever version they include is going to be outdated by the time you buy this but at the same time until you can get online to update the generic Windows drivers makes this card look sub-par in the graphics department. After the update though it looks great!

Can easily push 1080p video and very, very light gaming. My CPU is probably the biggest bottleneck now on my machine so I can't say anything definitively regarding that.

Overall outside of some minor issues with my particular use case I am very happy with this card."

I love silent electronics and this one is dead silent most of the time. Under load I can barely hear it. Also under load temps never (o rarely) go up from 65C (149F) wich is a perfectly comfortable operation temperature, and the fact that you don't need to plug any power connectors to run it means that almost any power supply should work.

1) it does not have a DVI port (that was my main connector to my monitor with the previous card) but instead has Display Port 1.4a, and 2 HDMI ports. So if you monitor does not support these, you will need and adapter or a new monitor (more likely. since DP is the best apparently)
2) this card does not require dedicated power supply (in fact, I do not see a place to add power directly to this thing) and it seems to work perfectly fine with my stock 255 watt PSU (I have purchased a 500 W PSU, but mostly because I got a good deal on it)
3) it takes up two adjacent expansion slots (in my case, no big deal since it is the ONLY expansion card in my case) but if you are short on space, this is something to keep in mind.
4) I was running games at their highest level and I can only assume the fans are working because the graphics never wavered but I also never heard the fans (which might simply mean the fans are ultra quite)"

First the good:
It was small and easy to install
It doesn't require any additional power beyond the slot itself
It is a quite card
The Bad:
It will not not allow surround with three monitors (which is why I bought the card). It seems like it should, but it doesn't. I checked online and the message boards. People mention the issue but no solutions that worked for me.
The worst:
I tried contacting Gigabyte. They never got back to me. I twice the first time I signed up for a call back (never happened). The second time I waited it out on the phone for over an hour with no pickup. :-( Not a great experience for me. YMMV.

After initially giving this product a negative review, I decided to contact NVIDIA before going through the hassle of removing the card and sending it back. I'm glad I did. they're customer support was excellent and they resolved my issue. The card is now able to do three monitor gaming (I needed new drivers). I still docked it one star for the terrible gigabyte service."

I havent tried changing any of the setting for a higher quality video experience.

UPDATE:
I got this video card to play Fallen Order but when I switched back to playing WoW a lot more my pc started rebooting while playing.

FPS is great in comparison to my old RX 480, temps are much better as well. The fans are practically silent up to 30% fan speed, you can hear it at 40% if you are about a foot away from your case.

Only gripe I have with this card is the price. The card is great and the cooler looks amazing, but the price is certainly up there - nearing 2070 prices. Current MSRP is $390, and I wouldn't advise paying any more than that for this card - or any RTX 2060 card for that matter. You may as well just start looking at the 2070's at that point."

When it was time for an upgrade, I researched graphics cards at the price point I was interested in ($200-350). It was a choice between the GTX 1660 ti, the RTX 2060, and the GTX 1070 ti.

I ended up choosing MSI's RTX 2060 Gaming Z edition, and I couldn't be happier. My main game on the PC is PUBG, and the GTX 1050 struggled real hard with it. I'd average 40-50 FPS, sometimes temporarily eclipsing 70-80. When I first installed the 2060, I had an issue with my monitor not picking up the signal. I was able to resolve the matter by resetting the bios on my motherboard. After that, everything ran smoothly.

After updating the drivers to the 2060, I jumped into a game of PUBG just to see what the difference looked an felt like. The game had reset all of my graphics settings from very low to ultra, which I initially did not realize. I was getting consistent 100+ FPS. After some tweaking of the settings, I found I could average 90-100 FPS on high/ultra settings, or I can get a consistent 110-120 FPS with a combination of low/medium/high settings for various options.

This graphics card is amazing, it's a game changer. It puts out power close to that of a GTX 1080 for half the cost. I went with the 2060 over the GTX 1660 because the difference in price wasn't too great ($40-70 depending on which edition of the 2060 and 1660 you look at) and the 2060 has my PC ready for future technology in gaming. The GTX 1070 TI was just a little too expensive for a card that had a similar performance. Ultimately, I paid $40 extra to get the MSI Gaming Z edition mostly because the back plating was made out of metal instead of plastic, and I wasn't sure how I felt about having a plastic plate.

No regrets, I love this card. It's brought my PC which was struggling to keep up into a monster. No issues at all so far. I downloaded MSI Afterburner to monitor and possibly try some overclocking, and the GPU idles at 35-40 C. It's peaked so far at 68 C while gaming. The GPU has two fans with a factory setting to not turn on until the GPU reaches a certain temperature. This can be overridden by user controlled settings within the MSI Afterburner app.

During the first month of having this card my computer would randomly freeze and I would have to restart. I put this towards it being a new build and Windows 10 defects (which there are many issues). Within a month of all the freezing and checks using all sorts of tools (making sure it wasn't windows), I started getting blue screens of all kinds.
Getting annoyed I removed the card and tried to uninstall the drivers, well this just messed up everything and had to do a full Windows reinstall(2nd time). It removed other drivers that had nothing to do with graphics and wouldn't even allow manual installs of drivers. I am an IT Manager for a local company and am not completely ignorant to doing these types of things, for those of you who think I am being dumb about it. I even tried to put this in my other gaming PC and had the same blue screen and freezing issues.
So after my reboot and reinstall I contacted MSI about the issue. I filled out a RMA for them to repair/replace the item and after 3 weeks of NO updates or correspondence of any kind. I contacted them and they told me that the item has been through the repair process and should be shipped soon. I received an email the next day saying the item has been shipped, which raised some suspicion.
The card arrived 2 days later and I have had no issues with my computer for over a month(RMA+shipping+prep time and PC tests). SO, I KNOW there is no issues with my PC at this point and am excited to play some games with my RTX card. So I shut my PC down, unplugged everything to install my graphics card yet again. Boots up fine install the GeForce Experience stuff and get all the drivers downloaded everything is working fine. Go to start up a game and really test this puppy out and upon loading the game my computer freezes..... JUST LIKE BEFORE!!!! SUSPICIONS CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!! MSI NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT THE ITEM EVERYTHING IS THE SAME!!!!!!! I feel like they just had the item in a pile, assuming they didn't just misplace it, then I email to ask about my item and then they just said ""Eh, probably user error just send it back."" Games freeze I can't even play one of my games because the game crashes withing 5 minutes of playing IF it doesn't crash on loading into the main screen.
At this point I don't even want a replacement I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I am going to write MSI a response to the RMA on the card and just request a refund. (Not that this will ever happen and I'm probably out the 390 bucks that I bought this item for PLUS the $40 I had to spend on the shipping for the RMA).

What a waste of time and money BUY SOMETHING ELSE!
Hope this helps some people and if you have also had this issue I hope something good happened for you."

(My prior setup used the old VGA connector so I didn't have a HDMI or Display Port cable.)
Otherwise this graphics card is nice. I only play on 1080P so it's probably overkill but it is a RTX card and I might upgrade my monitor in the future to take advantage of the higher resolutions and features including of course G-Sync. FPS is high in most every game that I play with the settings up as high as they will go. It's a wonderful card and my motherboard has Mystic Light and they look great together. I highly recommend it.

I wanted a more budget friendly GPU and didn't want to go with the 2070 0r 2080 due to the price hike and I'm glad I went with this for my first GPU. I haven't tried the RTX on it yet, so I can't say to much about that, but I will say for those that are looking to build a PC I would suggest they go with this GPU. Now, if the price is still a little high, I would suggest the GTX 1660, my brother and I used it for his build and besides that, everything else is the same. The FPS is still around mine on ultimate settings and you shouldn't have a problem running anything.

But their Dragon Center stinks. I had to try separate times to get it to turn off the RGB on the card. And then sometimes I'd reboot and it would reenable it. It would insist on installing cFosSpeed every time it started. Doesn't tell you it's doing it and if you uninstall it, the program just shows up installed again.

So finally got the RGB setting to stick and uninstalled the whole mess.

You want to buy doom, assassin's creed, tomb raider, or read dead redemption etc I'll give you a review. Or if I buy it I'll update the review. But I think it will be fine. My screen refreshes at 144 and the ms is low. I don't notice any annoying graphics issues. If I play grim dawn for over 3 hours and go all over the map, with everything on highest settings, I *might* see a slight flicker *maybe* once an hour. Not an issue.

It manages to get good performance in most games at high settings (Intel i7-9700k, 144Hz, 1080p, Med-High settings. Call of Duty Warzone averages around 120FPS, Destiny 2 is running at full 144FPS, and Overwatch performs well at high/ultra settings at 144FPS. It's a great value for entry level performance, but don't expect the whole ""RTX"" on experience with ray tracing - the frame rate drop is incredibly unbearable.

The RGB effect is an eye-catcher and is configurable in MSI's Dragon Center. There's a few nice modes in there. It's also pretty quiet as the Twin Frozr 7 fans turn off when not under stress.

If you're looking for higher/ultra settings, or if you're planning on using a 1440p monitor, I'd I'd look at a RTX2070ti or better. Overall, I'd recommend this if you're looking to upgrade from a mid-level GTX 10 series card."

On the surface, a sub $200 RX 580 is an incredible deal but there is a reason why it's so inexpensive. The memory modules are not cooled (see pictures) and this is completely unacceptable especially when considering that the RX 500 series are pretty much overclocked RX 400 cards with a bios flash. Those memory chips will eventually burn up and render the card useless. No wonder there are so many reviews here on Amazon and on Newegg mentioning dead cards.

Asus, this is unacceptable. Your engineering team could have least included a bracket for this card to cool the chips around the processor. What were your thinking? Trying to save a couple of bucks?"

That with the Asus cooling to which I'm reviewing, it makes for a great addition to an aspiring hardcore rig.
Pros:
-Built in heat detection that keeps the fans off until a warm 55C is present, keeping a idling or a low load rig from making too much noise.
-Overclocking is very possible while being able to keep the card at a safe heat index.
-Graphics card can handle nearly any modern triple A title and then some. Make sure you don't get bottlenecked by your processor, you don't want to hold it back.
-Great price for a higher mid range graphics card with a great cooling system.

Cons:
-Cooling fans can get quite noisy if the load is heavy. Your typical modern games with an impressive graphics load will usually cause this.(surprise)
-Because it's a mid-range card, this card will have problems with very heavy games graphically, but will usually triumph the game if settings are set a bit lower then max graphical settings(cri ;~;).

Even if this card is a mid-range power graphics card, it competes and will dominate almost any game you have in store for it, and make it look great. The cooling makes sure to keep the card a cool temperature while running intensive loads, however load it gets in the process, all while you get a good looking rig with good looking screens."

My monitor randomly freezes, the screen goes black, then I can hear the CPU fan speed up, and then suddenly the screen pops back up. It is struggling to play any video really before it freezes. I think i got a malfunctioning video card.

I've flashed my bios to the latest version (ROG Strix x470 f Gaming motherboard), I've freshly installed windows 10, and I've downloaded the latest drivers for the video card to no avail. Still the same problem. This card was on the certified list for the ASUS motherboard so I don't think its some compatibility issues where I need to tweak the GPU's settings.

I've contacted ASUS technical support to make sure I'm missing something, but I want to get a replacement at this point and see if replacing the GPU solves my problem. I'm fairly convinced it is just dead at this point. ASUS hasn't got back to me yet and I really don't want to go through amazon to get refunded and buy another one."

RX 580 performs as you would expect, about the same as a 1060. Has plenty of display ports, and outperforms every other version of RX 580 variations. LED's on it are awesome and looks amazing. Fans are used as needed which is extremely cool, turns on when it hits a specific temp. Stays really cool, and didn't even bother to OC because there is hardly any overclocking head room due to it being factory OC'd. If not this specific card, at least the Strix series in general."

Before that had used a Sapphire HD 6870 that STILL runs fine to this day (7 yrs old) but shopping for a newer model Asus had the best deal at the first of this month. Missed the end of Sept deals that were available...ggrrrrr. Same thing happened yrs ago (2012) when I was going for the HD 7970 at the end of Sept, they were reasonable, Oct rolled around and $200.00 was added on. That is when the bitcoin crowd started cornering the market so they could get themselves a Titan card.
This yr it was around a $90.00 jump from Sept to Oct. All I can say is since I have an Asus MoBo I decided to go for the Asus card, not to mention the price difference. I've heard good things about the Asus cards and will update as things roll on.
I will say that as far as performance goes the RX as opposed to the R9 is faster in the games I choose to play by a minimum of 50 FPS. Don't get me wrong the Dual-X R9 280 was a rebranded 7970 and when it ran it ran well but it did draw a lot of power anywhere from 200 to 500 watts whereas the RX is about half that and it only needs one 8 pin connection.
All in all very satisfied with the Asus model RX580 OC although the OC (the OC is about 1% tho) anyone moving from a R9 type will not be disappointed."

Bought this to put into an older HP system that I was moving to a dual boot Win10/Hackintosh. Hacintosh pretty much requires an AMD GPU so Team Green was out. As the title says, couldn't be happier. I have it driving an HP 75mhz Free Sync monitor and its beautiful. Most of my gaming is GS:GO, Civ V, Witcher III and older titles. Im running High settings, 1080p on all of them no problem.

The card requires an 8 pin connector from your PSU. If you don't have one and your GPU is under 400w, this is not the card for you (note - I am using a 6pin to 8pin adapter on mine).

I have done some limited overclocking using Overdrive but since Im pretty much getting 60+ fps on everything there really isn't any point.

If you have anything below a 1050ti, this is a great upgrade for the price. I have a 1050ti in another system and frankly there is no real difference on the games I play. Thats just me, YMMV.

I loved reading about their latest technologies and their efforts in the GPU market.
When they released 1060 I was in love with it. The reviews were awesome.
At that time, AMD got a second wind and revived itself like a Phoenix from its ashes with their Zen architecture and then Ryzen processors.
It was amazing seeing 580 against 1060 when the price difference was so great. The reviews were in 580's favor because of its price and performance ratio. Sure it doesn't flat out beat 1060 (it cant) but the price performance ratio was what gave it life.

Bitcoin miners killed the GPU market so when the 580 was available in a sale, I grabbed it and didn't look back. I love this GPU. It's awesome.

I used this card in my first built pc, and I'm still using it. It can run most games on ultra/max settings. On a scale, it is slightly better than the gtx 1060, due to its extra 2gb of video memory.

About 9 months into using the card I did get some coil whine. Obviously this is not universal, it is different for everyone's product as each one is ever so slightly different, (silicon lottery). I have noise canceling headphones (audiotechnica m40x) so it isn't much of a problem for me.

This is a large card, in my mid size case (phanteks P400) I had to readjust some things in the back so it could fit.

I like the color scheme, but unfortunately the fans face down, so you'll be seeing the back of the card unless your pc is above you."

Great value for your money. Stays a stable temp, and runs all my games smooth as butter on a bald monkey. Fans are relatively quiet, even on peak performance. Oviously if you crank them up, they get a bit louder, but so far, the card is very stable. I really like ASUS, and I've never had any problem with their products.

The only thing you really need to pay attention to is the massive size of the card. Do you measurements, and make sure you have plenty of clearence.

Secondly, I highly reccomend a horizontal mounting or a card support arm, the weight of the card can sag and strain your PCIe.

At first, it worked flawlessly, but a few months in I started getting HDMI Cable Disconnect errors with my Oculus Rift, and had to reboot the PC in order to fix that issue. Eventually I started getting random BSODS related to the graphics drivers, and just recently now it failed completely, simply refusing to boot past UEFI and the PC is stuck in an infinite reboot loop.

The online RMA process on their website is extremely buggy, I have tried to get it to work using Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome on my laptop, and on Chrome on my Smartphone, and none of them worked properly. Most likely I will have to give them a call to see what is up. After having read about the likely reasons why these are failing (insufficient cooling for certain chips on the board) I will likely be reselling whatever I get back from ASUS through the RMA process and using the money to defray the cost of purchasing a new GPU, probably NVIDIA since I have never bought a failed/failing card from them and there are also a few different programs I use with features that simply don't work outside of the NVIDIA realm."

not to mention it clocks in a little under the 1080 GTX which is 300$+ more. What a grat GPU this is!

Card overclocks easily into the high 1980-2060Mhz range with no bumps.

Hope this helps someone!
Yes,the brand new version is 50-70$ more and tbh its not a lot, but at the time the new one wasn't avaliable

Symptoms were black screen, fans NOT spinning except one briefly when the computer was turned on and off.. Reseating the DisplayPort cable at the graphics card seemed to fix the flickering in the past. Then one day my screen went black. The computer was still running, as I heard all the little children talking in their microphones in CS:GO. I figure maybe I have to reset the cable again. Nope... I never saw video from this card again. This is an vastly overbuilt computer -- literally the most stress this GPU went through was benchmarking/testing when I first installed it. It wasn't overclocked -- I wouldn't even know how to do that. I just installed it, installed the latest drivers, ran the tests the YouTubers told me to run, and was satisfied. So I engage with EVGA Customer Support who is nice, but tells me there's no warranty and no exception because the warranty ended April 2019. So basically EVGA GPUs last 1.5 years before they die? That's short! I have a Gigabyte 960 card that's been in 5+ computers and is much older and still works perfectly fine. In fact, it is the temporary replacement for the 1070ti that went bust. I get it that EVGA won't RMA/replace it, but throw me a bone with some kind of trade-in or discount just to placate someone who's now faced with another $500+ purchase because these GPU makers are still in cryptocurrency pricing. The thing was connected to a ""Platinum"" PSU which was connected itself to a very expensive battery backup/surge device in a house with whole home surge protection and power conditioning. There's really no excuse for the card to give up."

Gigabyte didn’t offer any suggestions or help in matching what cord I needed for my desktop computer.

I needed to upgrade my graphics card to do video editing using Pinnacle Studio 22 Ultimate. Before upgrading the card, the software would freeze when attempting to edit color in the video taken. Once I solved the power cord issue, the card works great for my stated application.

Great card for my application and for the money. I don’t use my computer for gaming, so I have no opinion on that subject. For a reasonably price graphics card for video editing, this card seems to be just what I needed.

I didn’t give a 5 star rating simply because of the power cord issue, and because I haven’t used the card for long, but I’m pleased so far."

Sadly, I'm not the first customer this happened to.
Pictures = the GPU enclosed w/ security seal unbroken. Clearly no backplate or LED.
First time wasn't a big deal - mistakes happen. Second time + others experiencing the same issue? Are they deliberately selling items that do not match the product description?
This is a cosmetic issue and doesn't effect the performance, but this GPU is going into a case with a transparent side panel, otherwise I wouldn't care about the missing backplate or LED.
Once I receive the correct GPU as advertised, I will edit this review.

This is an 8GB Radeon Rx590. BUT the picture of the box on the Amazon store front says it's is an RGB card. It is NOT. No light shows from this baby. Even though I don't really care about having RGB it is deceptive advertising so I am lowering the rating a smidge. It's also missing the promised DVI port.

I've only had it in my computer for half an hour, so nothing much on performance yet. Other then it seems to work fine. Unless I add an update, assume it performs to standard.

UPDATE! I got a swift response from the vendor I bought the card from, KW-TECH. Apparently there's been a mix up going with this card for the last few months. Affecting several of the vendors making use of Amazon Prime Shipping. They offered to manually ship me the correct card, at no extra cost. I am very happy with that solution. Good customer service!"

Started crashing in games after 20 minutes. Too long to return to Amazon and now going through the RMA process which is taking longer than I would expect plus they are making me pay for shipping. Last time I bought a Gigabyte product it was a motherboard and I swore to never do that again. Well with good reviews I was convinced otherwise and honestly I regret my purchase. We have 6 computers and 6 cards from various manufacturers. This is the only one we have had issues with. After doing my own troubleshooting it seems there may be a thermal paste issue with this particular card. If they fix the card sarisfactorily I could bump it to 3 stars maybe but with the fact the card performs worse than my 580 on benchmark and it is now failing I just can’t recommend this card to other folks. I will update once I get done with the lengthy RMA process as to if the card no longer crashes and if it performs as expected (at least as good as my 580). Honestly just no crashes would be fine as I don’t need the extra power I just need the card to work.

- Nice looking graphics card.
- Has a metal back plate, some cards are using plastic now.
- Has good proportions, not to wide and not to long. So should fit in most PC cases.
Cons
- Loud, very loud. Plan on using headphones or turning your speakers up.
- Hot, temperatures are high on this card.
- Could possibly be power limited if overclocking because of the single 8 pin.

Overall I wish Gigabyte would have; optimized the BIOS more, included more copper or aluminum fins, or both. This card is hot and loud. I prefer to setup my PC to run as quietly as possible. I do not know how much under volting will help reduce fan speed and temperature of this card. In all honesty, I doubt it helps much. But it seems most of the Radeon RX 590s are hot and loud. I haven't overclocked this card and I would not recommend it. I would not want the fans spinning any faster to keep the temperatures under thermal throttle."

Buy with confidence!
The box clearly states what is in the box. And benchmark software will verify it.
The other review on this card is wrong. I bought the same card for my kid and it does infact have DDR 6 memory. The first thing I do when I buy a new card is put it in a machine test it out with cinebench or one of many decent programs and even those list the ram as DDR6.

The rig i put this in is a bit dated. Specs are as follows.
Amd fx 8350---- clock 4000mhz
Motherboard -----Asus 990 evo r.2
Ram 16gb corsair vengeance 1600mhz
The monitor used was a dell 24in wide in 1440p
And the hard drive is a Samsung evo 500 gb.
And the power supply is a evga 850 watts gold rated with a year warranty.

The games tested were fortnight because thats all my kids want to play. But I also ran elder scrolls online.

On fortnite we got a stable 120 fps but would spike as high as 140 fps. The game was set to high quality.

The other game I tested was Elder scrolls online but I didn't hang around the old areas I went to Northern Elsweyr because there is finer detail there. Thats not to say the old original area look bad they hold up well for a mmo. I just wanted as much texture detail and draw distance at the same time to see what the card could do. I set the graphics to epic and I had a stable 70 fps but spiked up too 100 fps and these were frames in combat with plenty of effects like flame staff and other casting effects in air.

I also have a feeling this card can do even more but I think its bottlenecked. I didnt bother throwing it in my machine to test it i have a newer Ryzen. If I do I will update this review.

For a casual gamer this card is great amd even pushes past casual in my opinion. If I had to use this card personally I wouldn't mind, its a solid card for its price range and capabilities.

Like I said the other review is wrong about the memory type"

I did spend over two weeks shopping and comparing video cards between April and July 2020 and at the time I was stuck between user RX470/480/570/580s and this line of GTX cards - the 1650/1660. I did carefully choose this card because its the updated version that runs GDDR6 instead of the previous GDDR5. Even though it's only 4GB, it performs so much better after watching performance reviews online.

If I was to spend any more than this, I would choose the next best value with NVENC hardware encoding - the RTX 2060. I picked one up last month and am very happy. NVIDIA has a program called Geforce Experience that makes installing/updating drivers super easy with even more features built-in. Hopefully, this review will help you decide on what to do next.

All I have to say, these cards are both great, under 200 dollars. And deserve praise for their affordability and performance.

My 7-year-old rig has a new lease on life with this GPU. If you're looking for an extremely solid mid-range card at a budget price, then look no further.

The relatively low power consumption and operating temps are surprising considering its capabilities. The only real point of contention is the 4GB of VRAM--even though it is GDDR6.

I've noticed inaccurate or misleading descriptions on several of these, but I can confirm that is indeed EVGA's version of the 1650 Super. Be careful when shopping around, because some have been suckered into purchasing the far weaker base 1650,

You don’t need the most expensive model of card for it to be great! That said I felt the crunch of my over all build so I was looking for a cheap 1660ti.. Gigabyte Gv-N166TOC-6GD met that need and then some! This model does only have 1 heat pipe on the cooler but it’s still ok!!! I played overwatch 140fps 62-66c and 65% fanspeed on epic settings on a 2560x1080 monitor paired with i5 3570k (still waiting on new cpu and nvme ssd)

I must have won the silicon lottery because right from the manufacturer website my model is supposed to be 1800 boost and 1770 base reference, mine goes to 1875-1970 it will stay at 1970 if you slide the max power and temperature bar all the way to the right in msi afterburner...then you can further overclock the core and add 1000 to memory, boys and girls that’s 2060 performance!

mid-range card under $300 with tax you can't beat it. Yes the RTX cards are great, but not a lot of games support ray tracing & the other it offers plus an extra $70 plus tax it cost like $100 more.

I installed this card and Windows was able to run it at 1920 x 1080. Not great, but good enough for driver installation. The CD-ROM seemed to have a driver on it, but it was just an installer. OK, fine, it will fetch the driver from the 'Net for me. Well it downloaded 113MB of ""something,"" but it wasn't a driver. No, it was some program that insisted I CREATE AN ACCOUNT so I could get the driver. Oh, and there was a captcha, too. That was bad enough, but it gets worse:

1. It downloaded those 113MB at 20 KILOBYTES per second. I'll do the math for you: that's over 1.5 HOURS. (I have a cable modem that routinely runs at 1000x that speed, by the way.

2. Since I thought it was the driver, it wasn't until I exited the installer and tried to adjust the resolution that I realized it wasn't. I had to start over and wait another 1.5 hours for the same worthless program to reinstall.

I'm now about 4 hours into the process of getting the card to work and give me full resolution of 2560x1600. After the second download/install/run of the 113MB monstrosity, I created an account (why should I have to do that to get a driver? WHY?) and downloaded the actual driver: 200+MB this time, but at least it downloaded at full speed: about 15 seconds.

After installing the actual driver, I was able to select full resolution, get the 2nd monitor running, put all my icons back where they were, etc. Things were looking OK, despite the pain of the process.

Then the blue-screen crashes started. I took a snapshot of one just to prove I'm not making this up. They happened about once per day, and they were totally random. Sometimes I wouldn't be doing anything: no programs running other than the OS, no mouse or keyboard input; just sitting there, and bam--blue screen. Other times, I was doing actual work that was lost.

I ordered a Quatro P2000 to replace it. The experience with the Quatro was just the opposite: seamless install, no bloatware, Windows could operate it at 2560x1600 without their driver (I got in anyway, because that's what you do with video cards). Getting the driver was equally easy: no nonsense like account set-up or a captcha getting in the way--absolutely trouble-free. It has now been running 2 weeks straight, and not even a hiccup.

Needless to say, I returned this lemon of a product. Was it the card? Was it the driver? I don't know and I don't care. This will be my last Gigabyte card, that's for darned sure."

If this is all you can afford though, then this is a damn good card and my games look incredible. I can max out most games at 1080p with a minimum of 60fps. More demanding games, however, tend to dip down to 50 (looking at you rust), but I feel that is more of an optimization thing. A lot of really great looking games run much higher than 80fps. Games that are well optimized often breach 144 fps to keep up with my monitor.

Haven't really played many games on it yet that are super demanding, but the few game's I've tried have ran at 180-260 FPS on the highest settings at 1080p, but I usually just lock my fps to 144 for g-sync and its able to do that on all the games I've played so far.

Powering this is a 500w power supply. I initially was going to buy a GAMING X GTX 1050 Ti, but this is cheaper and will perform a little better with games

Back to the video card.
TDP is fairly low compared to AMD alternatives at this price point. However the RX 570 would do better in gaming but draws more power.

This card is fairly cool and even after playing APEX LEGENDS for 5 hours straight this card did not go over 60C. (I do have a fairly big case with good airflow, so your miles may vary).

With regards to looks, you'll love it or hate it. The shroud is a gunmetalish gray/silver. A good color that can blend in with any build. I DO NOT LIKE THE PCB's look though. I know this is a ""cheaper"" card with no faceplate and that is fine. But they printed the MSI DRAGON on the PCB in the corner of this card. I mean if you like that it is fine, but for me it's an eyesore to see that printed in white onthe corner of a PCB. Anyways it is what it is and I can always just choose not to look at it so that's fine.

After testing I've determined this card will serve well for a spare gaming PC. If you're on a budget this will serve you well if you need to ""go green"" or want to have a cooler card with a lower power draw. If all you want is RAW GAMING POWER at a budget I'd recommend looking for a good deal on AMD RX 570/580."

We looked at several options compared cards, prices, options. There was the card he has that was made in 2016 then this one. This card is a beast. Since I use my computer to not only game but to live stream gaming and video content, I also edit YouTube videos and live stream on YouTube as well. This card is amazing and 1000 % better than what I had. It was super easy to install and I love it had little ""hats"" over all of the ports and edges so as to not allow dust or fingerprints on the green board. The listing does say it comes with an Install cd which is does not. They need to edit their listing as it is misleading.

How to install, make sure your computer is turned off, install the card, then turn it on. Once your pc loads go to your control panel and click Hardware and Sound then click Device manager, use the search feature on there to ""find"" your new equipment if it did not pop up as the plug and play feature when you turn your machine on. Once you find it, it will ask if you want to install the best drivers, it will do the rest for you. No install CD necessary. Super easy to install, super easy to set up, works amazing!"

Meet the GTX 1650: kind of like The Little Engine that Could. Sure, this card won't blow your socks off with 60+ FPS on every game, but if you aren't needing or expecting that then I believe this card is a pretty good choice for either people on a tight budget or people who only play some older titles. I took a star off because I believe this card should be 15 or 20 dollars cheaper. I think it's a good value, but if they dropped the price a bit it would really be worth it. The biggest pro is that it runs cool and quiet. Even at full load for a while it doesn't really go above 60c and it draws very little power. It runs most of my games at high settings ~45 - 60 FPS and I haven't had any issues with it. I recommend this card if you are the right audience for it."

Basically on the lower budget build but all new part gave us all new title games on high with 1 setup and high with 1 or 2 things turned off.
No matter what the data says on paper or these app monitors you have showing Frams-Per-Second
The fact is it plays Ark survival a very demanding ram and graphic hog game, Fortnite, Call of Duty-Warfare, and Battle field 5 all with everything turned up and no hick ups. Turn 1 thing or 2 down for more FPS optional at 16 Gigs of Ram.

Set up 2 is My husband put 32 GB of Ram before splitting it with other pc just to test the new GTX 1650 at its finest and just like always proves more ram equals better gaming. All setting in every game at highest nothing turned down , no glitch no stutter, smooth sailing.

Its was a great Buy, would recommend to all. Just add more Ram than needed from recommended spec games the ultra sweet spot is 32gigs, ebay Ram $114 (32GB Kit) to G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) at $139.99 as of 1/10/20 Add a GTX 1650 and CPU 4 cores and higher ( I5-9600k cheap 6 Cores 6 Threads ) and there would be no game you cant handle"

All got me wonderful referral to try one of the others, but no contact with msi. I then contacted Amazon, who gave me a direct msi email contact, who answered by email almost immediately.

 The MSI GEFORCE GTX 1650 is an amazing Graphics card. It has so money unique qualities like an rgb light at the front with the logo and also has a bigger version of their logo on the bottom (it’s actually on the top, because the fans point downward) of the GPU. The white dragon logo looks so sick also. The graphics in game are amazing and very smooth whilst being clean and no spikes at all! I used this GPU with my first ever gaming pc build, as you can see by the pictures, and it works fantastic, you are able to overclock the gpu itself and it works even better performance wise. It is very easy to install into your Mobo and looks very sharp inside the case too. It’s very quiet and when you aren’t using the gpu to run any kind of game, or program that doesn’t require the gpu to be needed to run, the fans don’t come on because they don’t need to. The fans will only come on when your pc needs them to come on. If you are watching a video online it’s really quiet because the gpu isn’t running the full power it can. Even with the gpu fans and all running, it still is a very quiet card. The only things I can hear from my pc are the six fans that I have on the case itself. And they are really quiet as well. All-in-all this product is definitely a great gpu and is perfect for a budget gaming build like me. This gpu can run any game you throw it’s way, wether it’s mortal combat, Gta 5, FiveM, CSGO, or even Destiny 2, with high settings, if you have the right setup. MSI is definitely a trusted brand and a great company as well, the box that this product came in was so nice and the packaging was durable, yet very sleek and you should definitely buy this if you have the money. I’m definitely going to be buying more stuff from this brand."

It is a pretty decent card. It is well built, factory overclocked (if you dont like messing wit Afterburner and stuff i guess), fans dont spin until it reaches a certain temp so it runs very quiet, the power draw of 1650 is very low, the fans are quality fans... Just know there are better options for the price. A 1650 Super or rx 570 will give better performance at similar sometimes even lower cost."

It runs all my favorite games at the highest graphic settings at 50-60 FPS, some games such as fortnite and cities skylines are still running 45-60 FPS at high settings (not the highest, but just below very high or sometimes known as ""ultra"". It has amazing performance, even under complete load didn't surpass 65 degrees C, which is warm, not hot (70-80 degrees C) and not even close to overheating (90+ degrees C).

Amazing card overall, it was just very tedious to get the card working. It originally put me into a BSOD booting loop until I took the card out of my PC booted into windows normally, and used a third-party program to completely remove all traces of graphic drives so I could boot up with my new card and have windows automatically install all drivers without conflict of additional programs and data."

When it finally did I was disappointed to find that my GTX 960 graphics card would only run the game at the very lowest settings. A title known for its beauty looked pretty awful. This card changed things dramatically at a very reasonable price. It’s now everything I had heard it was and I get butter smooth 40 to 50 FPS. Not the best I know but for the price I am very pleased. I would recommend it to anyone who can’t or won’t pay for the high end cards.

Their hardware is great only when it successfully installs. Good luck with that. They have gone from a company making great gpus to a company that make great gpus with the worst driver software compatibility issues in history. It is absurd that to install drivers for a $160 gpu you have to spend hours failing miserably every time. Not to mention the GeForce experience bloatware. If you are on win 10 and a slightly older version it is a hit or miss. Good luck.

Do yourself a favor and get the AMD rx560. It is cheaper, faster, runs cooler and installs without nonworking bloatware on the first try. Lesson learned."

I'll separate this review in to three sections: The Good, The Bad, and the Recommendations; If you do plan to buy this Videocard at the very least check out the final section to save yourself a lot of trial and error in set up. Tl;DR: I DO recommend this card but only if you're willing to mess with it's drivers and tunings to make it work.

The Good(Including technical Info):
This card has the best price per power on the market full stop, no competition. It outperforms the 2060, it's direct competition, and matches or sometimes even surpass the 2070S which runs about a hundred dollars more. You don't get in to objectively better performance until the 2080S and at that point you are, at the time of writing, paying $300 more. The card easily runs Final Fantasy XIV, Monster Hunter World Iceborn, and Star Citizen at 1440p. At max settings in all three games I get 90-110 FPS in FFXIV (Full 144 if I turn off SSAO), 60fps in Iceborn with the High Res Textures pack, and about 45-60FPS in Star Citizen. All of these games get the full 144fps of my monitor at 1080p.

Temperatures are amazing, but you probably guessed that looking at it's three large fans. I run 85 under full load typically and the card is rated to run 95 comfortably. It starts to thermal throttle at about 110. If you give the fans room to breath it runs nice and quiet, however if your fans are too close to anything it'll suddenly become a jet engine (A mistake I made initially).

The Bad:
Woo boy, you'd think from what I listed in Good i'd be giving it five stars but here is where we get in to it. First, the drivers are terrible, I spent probably two full days installing drivers, updating them, realizing the updates are unstable, deleting drivers, reinstalling old drivers. Do yourself a favor and run the tool, get recommended drivers NOT optional/optimal drivers, they aren't stable. Constant crashing, DirectX Errors, Err12's, all of it coming back to the card's video drivers or the card itself. The card is also a power hog, you need to have two six pins and a good PSU. Expect to run in to problems on Gold Rated 650W power supplies or even older 850W. These problems are manageable though.

What it comes down to: You will have to fight this card. I fought it for two days trying to tame it, i'll detail how I finally fixed all it's errors below, but be ready to put in work for this money you're saving. I still have some minor errors, for example if my PC auto sleeps then the card wont wake up and i'll have to hard reset the PC.

Lastly, I lost the lottery on this card and ended up getting one with coil whine. This isn't uncommon on this card, a very weak buzzing sound that is triggered by certain activities. This can happen with any new GPU and is harmless but annoying, just note that it's slightly more common with this GPU than others. They will usually RMA it for you if you get one with coil whine but for many people it just wont be worth the time of sending it in and getting a new one. If your computer is in a case and under your desk, or in my case on the wall, you wont hear it.

Recommendations(Or; I tuned this card for an entire weekend so you didn't have to):
First, as I said above, get only the recommended drivers. Do not get any additional, optional, or ""Optimal"" drivers, they're almost never stable with AMD. Second, turn off all of AMD's proprietary booster nonsense *especially* Free Synch, as of writing this causes intense flickering and hard crashes. Once the card is stable you can try turning some of these things back on, but do it one by one. Turn off all of Microsoft's Game Mode stuff, you should honestly do this anyway but double especially do this when running this card because it doesn't play nice with AMD's drivers.

Finally, and possibly most importantly, if you're experiencing a lot of crashes you NEED to undervolt it. This is probably your issue if you're running a 650w or an older 850w. This was, at the very least, my biggest issue and it took me two days to figure out. I recommend maximum Voltage of 1100 and Frequency of 2000. You can find the tuning controls in AMD's Adrenaline software. What tends to happen is when the voltage spikes to 1200 if you're running a split cable then it overworks the GPU and causes a hard crash in many games.

Followed install directions

1) Download the correct AMD Full Set of drivers from AMD Support. Make sure your Windows is fully updated via Windows Update. Windows Must be fully updated because the latest AMD Drivers requires all the latest ""Optional"" and ""Recommended"" updates to be installed.

2) Use Windows Uninstall to uninstall current AMD driver and software and disconnect the internet from your computer. Then use DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) from Wagnardsoft Forum in Safe Mode. This will eliminate all traces of the AMD and Nvidia driver and software from your computer.

Delete C: \ AMD folder from the Root Directory. Reboot

3) Go to Device Manager and click ""Display Adapter"" and make sure you are on the MS Basic Display Adapter. If not, uninstall the AMD driver using Properties.

4) Try reinstalling the AMD FULL SET OF DRIVERS that you have downloaded manually. Make sure you disable the Internet to prevent Windows from installing a newer version. So configure windows to prevent it from updating drivers via windows update. So it has been mentioned to disable any anti-virus programs before installing AMD Drivers.

5) If the new AMD drivers installs and works correctly, delete again the C: \ AMD folder from the root directory. To save space on the HDD.

6) Enable both the Internet and Anti-Virus program (if applicable).

7) Go back to Device Manager and check your GPU card driver is working and identified correctly.

Hopefully it helps you out because it worked for me. Was running 3dmark and apex on it. Will update if it changes.

Edit: screen started to freeze. Read that any type of mintor software conflicts with the drivers... So msi afterburner, hwmonitor, etc. Going to try uninstalling and seeing if that works. If not I'm going to return. Went from a 4star to a 3star.

I'm about day 9 with the gpu and after a bunch of tinkering and troubleshooting I'm returning. When it ran it was a great pcie 4 gpu but the problems with drivers and conflicts with other programs was a pain. I didnt want to reinstall windows because that's a hassle moving data around. Installed an asus Strix 2070 super and it's been running like a dream. Had to pay the premium for something that works. :/"

Really a good buy for the money if you not looking to drop $2500 on a computer.

AMD took care of business too with those buggy drivers early in 2020. If that's one of your concerns, I can assure you, they fixed a lot of the major issues for a lot of the customers and they're working hard to fix even more. I was lucky enough to avoid the early drivers, but I can tell you as of writing this review, the only problem I had was some green screening issues so I just installed the drivers manually without the Adrenaline software and it's been smooth sailing. If you care about the Adrenaline software, I'm sure it'll be in a better state in the next few months. The support you get along with this card is great."

Again, not just barely me, but exceeded.

When running any type of game, even low to medium settings, it would crash and begin a reboot of the computer. Be it Fortnite, Fallout 4, any type of benchmark, etc., it would just crash. Completely unusable and effectively DOA.

Conversely, I have a friend that has the EXACT SAME BUILD as I do, down to the power supply, etc. and he has no issues. I'm thinking I just got unlucky. MAYBE it was the unlucky delivery OUTSIDE OF ANY BOX (see photo). I like how an expensive $400 electronic item was shipped unprotected (no box + bubble wrap) and just thrown around during shipping, only to wait on my porch out in the open. Lovely. I guess that's how electronic items, sensitive to vibration and impact, are shipped nowadays."

I have edited the fan curve with afterburner as stock fan curves have not been good in years. Drivers have been solid but i got the card on 12/05/19 so I didn't have to deal with launch drivers. The card is big takes up over 2 slots and it is long, so make sure it can fit in your case first, I also recommend you buy an ""upHere Graphics Card GPU Brace"", they cost like $7 on amazon for the black one and it gets rid of gpu sag and this thing will sag lol.

If you're getting high temps set a custom fan curve either using amd's software or afterburner. If that isnt helping then your case probably has really poor airflow."

Connected two PCI 8 pin connectors to the Graphics card instead of the one cable that has two 6+2 pins. Tried the 5700xt with my old 6700k build and my current 3700x build. No fix. Lasted motherboard bios update. Disabled all 4.0 PCI-E lanes to 3.0. Still no fix. I went through three of these cards from different brands. No fix. No issues with my GTX 1070. Such a shame.

When I first got it everything seemed fine, but as soon as I downloaded the drivers this all changed. Nothing but repeated black screens graphical glitches and hard crashes. I searched through various forums to see if perhaps I did something but nope, many other people are suffering the same issues and the solutions are so random and all over the place that it's hard to pin point exactly what the issue is.

I understand that development for these kind of thing can be difficult and there are many people who work hard to deliver this product. However, I as a customer, at the bare minimum expect the product to work, especially when I've spent hundreds of dollars on it.

Here I am months later with the warranty expired and I cannot get my money back. A cautionary tale for anyone considering the 5700 xt, do your research or better yet save your money and wait for AMD to figure this mess out."

I was not aware that my old 480 could only go so far but I was wrong as keeping up with all the new graphics and high end settings was not doable, until now. The 5700 xt did not have any driver issues or external issues which is one thing I love so far as my 480 would start to stutter every month or so. I am glad to see that my drivers do not flicker anymore or don't drop any frames while I move to other tabs. As a heavy work intensive user I can say that this is the card Ill recommend others to get as well. Not only is this card on par with other graphic cards, but the 5700xt can offer more frames per second on certain games. My 5700xt combined with my i9-9900k delivers powerful and instantaneous frames per second on all applications. I was only scared of the few reviews saying that the drivers were a problem but that was not the case for me. I do like the new Adrenalin application that AMD provides with the 5700xt as my 480 COULD NOT offer me that application due to stress factors. Other than that pretty great and really little to no noise from the 5700xt. Its good to know that my new graphics card won't be hearing like a turbo engine anytime soon!"

The card's cooler works great on the core temperature, but the junction temps are rather toasty (hitting 115c at stock voltage of 1.200v) causing the card to throttle itself down to prevent overheating. For those that don't know what throttling is, it's when the card reduces its speed and voltage to prevent a total failure. While it may not be damaging to the card, the down-clocking is extremely noticeable in games, giving you stutters while the clock speeds jump around + or - 500mhz.

The way to fix this is to lower the voltage on the card using either AMD wattman or another 3rd party overclocking utility, for example MSI afterburner. Note that if reducing voltage you will most likely have to reduce clock speed slightly. I was able to stabilize the card at 1.130v and 2075core clock with a very aggressive fan profile, (note that 2075 core means the card will really be running around 2025-2030 in game, that's just the way AMD cards work). The fans ramp up to 75% and they are definitely audible but it runs much cooler now with temps around 78c on the core and barely touching 100c on the junction so the card will not throttle down.

As far as performance this card has the bang for the buck. It handles most games at between 100-144hz @ 1440p high settings. One step up from this card at the moment is the 2070 super and that card is about $250 more for maybe 5% more overall performance. I'd say go AMD if your trying to choose between the two, just be willing to do some tweaking to get good performance."

Finally got annoyed of lottery of driver updates and what blue screens of death or freezes I would get. I sold it on ebay for a little loss and ended up getting an open box RTX 2070 until I can find a 3080 at deal (who knows when?)

When all things are working the 5700xt was a better card than this place holder msi 2070 ventus gp I have but with all the issues everyone including myself has; RTX just easier for gamers and Nvidia has a simple interface where you can one button hit the game you want to play and click optimized settings instead of googling what should i set my GPU for such and such a game.

***Installs RTX card and not one issue ever, period the end. In a perfect world if I wanted similar or higher performance I would got a 2070 Super in the $450+ ish range.

I am decently computer savvy and was running an RX570 on a gigabyte a320 board. I could play most of my games decently on a low setting but now the COVID lockdown and free time I got picky and figured why not go for the best out there (AMD since I have AMD Processor and MOBO etc.)

1- I would do a clean uninstall of your previous graphic drivers there are tutorials online. (I had a few black screens and crashes when I was messing around with older ""Stable"" versions. I am running the most current.

2. I updated my chipset drivers which I think fixed most of my issues; ""fingers crossed."" Go to AMD site find your AM4 chipset driver for your board (I have a cheap a320 which is the complete opposite of the graphics card in terms of the price point but it does exactly what I need; If I had extra cash I get one of the PCI Gen 4 cards which probably will come in handy in the future.)

3. It is a large card, make sure it is seated properly. Take your time and give it the proper install it needs by removing components to make sure the connection is 110% in and good. Also, it takes two 8pin male to power this thing. So I would recommend a 650 power supply because it does eat up all 225 watts when your gaming.

-I have an older nonmodular power supply so I used 8 pins to data adapters which seems to power everything just fine.

4. make sure your windows are updated. Make sure your BIOS is updated.

Be ready to make a clean install if you keep getting green screens, power-offs, black screens, audio crackling etc.

If you don't have patience tinkering around for driver, bios, windows updates, and modifying your computer then 110% don't buy this card.

I primarily play apex and yes it's nice to have everything set to high. Is it worth the price of PlayStation (to be determined) - I'm still waiting on my ryzen 5 3600x to replace my 1600af (didn't want to bottleneck this bad boy)

I would invest in some extra fans they are cheap and help with overall cooling.

DONT BUY THIS AND RETURN IT FOR A 2070 bc you are lazy. This thing is a BEAST! will update when my upgraded CPU and I have a few more hours logged on it.

p.s. modify your windows power settings to hi-performance or ultimate. This card eats power and if you have any of the power saving or ""balanced"" issues turned on it might spike a random crash.

-PROS FAST AF
-PCI 4 (Not a noticeable gaming fps change from 3/4 but the larger lane will come in handy in the future.)
-Comes out of the box overclocked (download the latest 2020 software and you should be good to go)

-CONS Needs to be tech-savvy in terms of bios, updating, drivers etc/
-A gigantic card and anything in its way is best moved (I have one less SATA port to ensure a tight seal for the card)

Shipping was in its own box which is kinda scary since UPS is just throwing packages around (ask for gift options so you get an extra box for a piece of mind)

Was running apex on all low and disabled settings at 130-140 fps.

Now on all MAXED settings 167 ish.. and yes the details are really nice and I'm picking out targets farther away so I'm 3.8 out of 5 happy (biggest annoyance way a literally 8 hours of troubleshooting. Hopefully I'll save someone else the headache)

and if the game bundle has any value to you : Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and 3 months of Xbox Game Pass for PC.

I'm a resident evil fan so hopefully getting this 50 dollar title for free will offset some of my financial pain.

update: running with no issues for a month. I would of done a clean install of windows to save myself the headaches of BSODS when I first got it. Happy with the purchase."

XFX unfortunately earned themselves a bad rep with their 5700 xt line of cards due to their thicc II card having serious overheating problems. It's actually hard to find many reviews for this revision, but can confirm this card runs extremely cool, but I also have a custom fan curve with complete disregard for noise, it does get loud, but they keep the card very cool. Playing any game with it being around 70-80f in my room, the card under load has remained around 60's and under. As far as FPS goes ~100 @1440p, 165hz on max settings (100% res scale) across all games (EI Battlefield 1, CoD: MW). This is paired with a 9700k and 32gb CL 15.

The one and only negative thing I may have to say is the packaging truly is terrible. Not much to protect the hardware (box was perfectly intact though). But on the flip side, I can recall my last card from Nvidia having even less protective packaging so there's that. But over all it was very generic, almost like something you'd buy used. Something that actually annoyed me is the plastic covering on the cards shroud was a massive pain to peel off, they didn't hold back on it, I'll say that much. Somewhat irrelevant though, the card itself works great and I like that it's nothing too flashy and isn't trying hard with the Im A GaMeR BrO designs.

Lastly, drivers. I'm not sure how many of these reviews were before the latest driver update, but as of right now the only issue I've had with the drivers was with WoW Classic, I ended up having to reinstall it for whatever reason, haven't had issues with any other games. The thing I have to commend AMD for is their Adrenaline software is superb, way more options (including its own custom fan curve software 10/10), way better UI than GeForce Experience, maybe I'm now an AMD shill, but Adrenaline alone makes me not want to buy another Nvidia card. Depending on how long this card lasts in lifespan and performance, I can easily see myself buying more AMD cards."

I was skeptical having heard of the driver issues that plagued the 5700 XT's at launch and the horror stories of this card running 100c. I am here to tell you that I am running the latest drivers as of this writing (20.8.1) and having zero issues. My idle temp (GPU fans off) is right around 40c and at 100% GPU load the temp is 65-69c with the stock cooler.

I am running an older Cooler Master HAF case with plenty of air flow and that might contribute to my experience but I suspect folks talking about temps are either referring to the THICC II model which previously had a cooling issue or a different implementation of the 5700 XT altogether.

Regarding performance:

I upgraded from an XFX RX 580, which is a good budget FHD (aka 1080p) gaming card. The FPS difference for me while gaming is huge, with most titles hitting double or more the framerate. For reference, I am running an i9-9900k on an ASUS ROG STRIX Z390-E with an XFX 750W Pro PSU.

The two games that I have played since upgrading are COD Warzone and Borderlands 3. Warzone FHD max settings bounce between 130-150 FPS with OBS recording on the same system. Borderlands 3 FHD max settings bounces between 100-120 FPS.

Please note that my review is limited to FHD gaming as my preference is to game at or as close to 144Hz as possible on typical desktop gaming displays for the types of games that I play. Your mileage may vary.

Regarding value:

The XFX RX 5700 THICC III Ultra competes with and often beats the competing nVidia 2070 Super in benchmarks and real world usage. The nVidia 2080 Super is the next best performing current generation card on the market right now, but it nets marginal performance gains for nearly twice the price which leads me to crown this particular 5700 XT the value king for enthusiast gaming. A very good friend of mine has a Zotac 2080 Super and depending on the game and driver specific optimizations, I can actually get higher FHD framerates at the stock XFX clocks."

I bought this to replace my RX Vega 64 reference card that drew so much power at load it melted, yes melted, the wiring on the 8 pin power adapter I was using. Cheap adapter, good card, but noisy at load and I swear my lights dimmed when it hit peak levels. Also AMD's stock fan speeds would default to disturbingly low at load in the newest version of the drivers.

This card draws vastly less power at full load, Provides better performance, and the cooler keeps it nearly silent in most situations barring the stressful loads, and I adjusted the fans to spool up sooner because I'm weird like that.

The cons... This card is HUGE and long... When sitting next to my RX Vega 64 reference card it makes that card look tiny. (see included photo for reference) It is not drastically heavier though. Just bigger. It will require two 8 pin power connectors, and a significant power supply. The box suggests at least 600W, I would suggest 700+.

CHECK AND MAKE SURE IT WILL FIT IN YOUR CASE BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!!

It fits absolutely fine in my now aged Cooler Master ATCS 840, but Midsize towers probably won't have room.

World of Warships, everything pretty much cranked at 3440X1440 basically hits the capped frame rate limit rarely dropping.

COD:MW stays around 60-80 FPS at the same resolution with whatever settings it defaults to for my setup, and the new Black Ops Cold War does about the same.

My current system is CPU bottlenecked until the new Ryzen 5600X is in stock, somewhere, so I can put in my new mobo and a faster CPU, so your performance numbers may vary for the better...

My system as of writing:
AMD Ryzen 5 1600x
ASRock AB350 Pro4 Motherboard
32GB Corsair Dominator DDR4 3200
Crucial Mx300 1TB SSD
Cooler Master RM850X (850w) Power Supply
Cooler Master ATCS840 Case

The CPU is cooled by a Corsair H150i so the loudest fans in the system are the Video card's at load. I work around heavy machinery so I'm accustomed to constant noise, but I rarely ever notice any sound from my PC and it is sitting close enough that literally my left leg is touching it right now.

Overall this is a great card. Is it worth the money? I think so. Nvidia has faster cards, but at a higher price point, and their cards at this price point are close in speed, or slower. If you have the extra cash, I say move up to the Nvidia cards, or wait for the new AMD 6000 series cards, but if this is where your budget sits this card will be the performer for a while at this price point IN MY OPINION... (other's opinions may vary)."

This thing is huge though. My Meshify C case max GPU length size is 315mm so this just fits and touches the fan. I did have some problems when I first installed it but that's cause it was a new build. I decided to run with the card uninstalled till I set up Windows 10. Once that was ready I installed the card with no problems. Got the latest non experimental drivers from AMD as well.

I'm running COD and Star Wars Fallen Order at max settings. That's when the card fans get loud but understandable when you are gaming. At idle the card is silent. Would recommend this to anyone looking for an AMD card that's in par with the 2070 Super."

Works well with PCI passthru.","After hearing of driver issues, I held out until they were fixed. I wanted a card that would do me good for awhile, and as I play on 1080p 144hz, I knew this would be the card. Some say it is overkill, perhaps they are right but if I ever go to 1440p I know I'm ready, monitors are expensive, especially 1440p 144hz!)

You can feel quality when you hold it in your hand. Metal backplate, so it's stiff, a little heavy but it doesn't sag too bad, maybe a few degrees. Kinda gives me a Cadillac vibe with the grill.

As a note, I use Proxmox as my host operating system, with a windows virtual machine with vfio to pass through the GPU and game. I have had to tinker to get it to work, but it is working with no issues, plenty of guides online.

The performance has been nothing short of amazing, especially when you consider the price is $400. Zero blue screens or driver issues, junction temperature is staying at 70°C under full load, and the noise is acceptable. I personally don't care how loud a card is, *as long as the cooling if effective*. Changed the default can curves up much higher, starting at 40% at idle, going to 90% at 100°C. As such I've not seen this card go over 72°C. The fans at 100% are a bit loud, but it's not obnoxious. I am very happy with the cooler design and that XFX refreshed this card, and made it longer. I think that really helps with the temps. Even more pleasing as I am concerned about longevity, a bigger cooler keeps things colder and thus the heat stress at Bay.

I had a 1660 super, but found frame rate in games to be lacking at times, which in turn had to lower detail levels. Ultra everything is a breeze for this card, I haven't gamed on PC in many years, so much so I am used to Xbox 360 graphics. The immersion and high refresh rate just make the experience so much better. Sure it's not a 2080, but I feel like I'm getting the performance of a 2070, very close to it (partner has one).

I am impressed with the drivers and utilities. AMD has done a great job, with Nvidia, you have to get other utilities to do what AMD includes, like undervotling or fan curves. Room for improvement, but it has won me over so far.

Buy with confidence, I love this card.

Edit: I should mention those temperatures I listed were at MINIMUM case fan speed, I turned my fans up to max, (10x 140mm cheapo fans @1400rpm) and this card only hits 55C even with an over clock."

this video card installed easy, had some issues with some of it's software but that was because of the rest of my system being older.

pros: 4GB GDDR5 dedicated ram, compatibility with current video connectors (DVI, HDMI, Display port)
Cons: power needs (but worth it), no CrossFire/SLI function beyond the MB bus.

i would recommend it to anyone on a budget or even looking for a basic upgrade from anything more then 4 months old in technology releases."

I did nothing really to stress test it. I read news sites, watched movies, edited some videos, and used 3d design apps. Late June the card began to freeze, my system would still be on but no video would display. I would be forced to perform a hard shut down. I switched output ports and still had the same results. Over time the card began crashing every 5 minutes. Even the basic Google search page crashed the card. I followed online instructions to fix possible issues. Nothing I tried fixed the issues. I contacted XFX and they had me basically repeat what I had already tried. To no avail. Now I get to send the card back to them at my expense. Wait for them to send me a replacement. Which may be the fixed card I purchased or a refurbished model. This card is not worth the hassle. Avoid it."

Recommendation for this card is get your Power Supply Unit and PSU cables in check.

Thermals are about on par with the FE, so the extra $300 is really buying the EVGA label and aesthetic.

This was the first 30 series I could snag after months of trying every in stock notification on several sites for 3080 and 3090. I've always been fond of the EVGA cards I've had in the past and it would have been my preferred 3rd party seller even if I'd had full choice.

Can't say how much of an upgrade this would feel like coming from a 1080 Ti or 2080 Ti, but from the Radeon R9 390 I upgraded from, it feels like several generational leaps.

RTX has pleasantly suprised me. From the marketing prior to trying it I had thought of raytracing as a gimmick, but seeing it in games and the way the scene behind your character is reflected on surfaces in front of you (windows, puddles, shiny cars, etc) is subtle but psychologically impactful in immersing you in the world.

Shadows are the element next most improved by raytracing, looking a bit softer and more realistic than even those produced by the complex lighting systems of recent years.

This model directly uses 3 full 8-pin connections from your PSU, rather than being adapted to a 20-pin like the FE cards. The height is a true 3-slot card, but it is very wide and very long - definitely measure your case. My case door barely clears the power cables.

It is heavy too, so if sag bothers you there are riser/pole/stand things that support the front of the card, given that your case is long enough to fit that accessory."

Ideal for LG OLED 4k TVs. Please note that the card is very hot and you need a large case so that the fans are on the bottom and the processor is water-cooled. I'm glad I was able to buy this card before the release of Cyberpunk.

I want to add that you need to use 3 separate power connectors for good overclocking and airflow case. I had case nzxt and the temperature there was 82-84 degrees, in this case 70-72 degrees."

I'm getting consistent frame rates even in busy scenes. Not one notable hiccup on frame drops in four days I've played using it.
I upgraded from my RTX 2080 Super. The frame rates notably jumped with higher avg frame rates. This translates to smoother game play at max settings. Playing Borderlands 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, the increase was within 15 - 20+ @ 1440. I'll also note this card has a physical onboard Overclock switch that is set Normal. I have not tested this.

Its BIG and Heavy
There's no getting around this. Length and Width are considerable and I would really consider the case one plans on putting this into. ie: Your case should be running a cool ambient temperature and offer plenty of space for air flow. It's three lanes wide and those fans need little to no obstructions. See attached pics for reference comparisons to a RTX 2080 Super. Medium sized cases with plenty of components inside may present ambiet cooling challenges.

RTX: Real Time Ray Tracing and DLSS
Yes, RTX can have some really impressive effect when used but its still very expensive when enabled. It saps an avg 20 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077 and to be quite honest, the game already has some impressive visuals, for me, those extra frames are better used for actual fights. DLSS 2.0 is the real technology here worth writing about. It really does create some impressive scaling that yields impressive performance gains.

Power Hungry
I am running a two year old EVGA 1000 Watt PSU running an OC'd CPU, 32GB sys RAM, two HD's and one SSD and an optical drive. This card has three 8 Pin power connectors so it is power hungry. It is not advisable to use a power split cable (a cable with two 8 pin plugs).
Now, I have checked EVGA's official forums and the mods have verified that newer PSU's rated at 800 Watts or above are good to use two 8 Pin power cables instead of three. Having read reviews were people are encounter high temps, excessive fans, and frame rate issues, I went with three separate cables running into my PSU. I haven't encountered any problems.
I am running this on a Corsair water cooled system in a big case which runs very quietly and I've yet to hear the fans on the 3090 run up while playing any titles.
If you are running a much older PSU and/or its rated below 800 Watts, you might really consider upgrading it.

What Frame Rates can you expect?
Unless you are running top tier Intel or AMD CPU's your frames won't match those posted on Tech Review sites. My frame rate increases are relative to my existing hardware, particularly the CPU. It shows in the fact that I am using a mid range CPU from two years ago. An OC'd Intel i7-7700K. So I will not be hitting those numbers until I complete my system built around AMD's Ryzen 9 5900X.

Final Word
Unless you're a content creator, this card is a bit of overkill in the cost to performance gains. I use editing applications that benefit from architecture in the RTX 3090.
Due to its sheer size and power requirements, I really can't see this going into a mid sized cases especially if overclocking is a goal. Cooling could be a problem.
A card like this really is set back if its being paired with mid range components. I can see that with my build right now which is why im building a new rig around it.
For that reason, I would be hard pressed to recommend the 3090 just for gaming when the RTX 3080 is likely the best bet in cost and power usage. The net gains here are minimal in comparison."

87.0,MSI Gaming GeForce GTX 1070 Ti 8GB GDRR5 256-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 SLI TriFrozr Fan VR Ready Graphics Card (GTX 1070 TI Duke 8G),MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,1683 MHz,8 GB,$13.59,4.7 out of 5 stars,"Great GPU, poor cooling, and terrible thermal paste job. Recommended only if you're willing to put in some effort (see review).","This review is for the MSI GTX 1070 ti Armor edition GPU.

First and foremost: It's big. Make sure your case has enough space. I initially intended to install this in a Thermaltake Core V1 case and per spec I had enough room... in theory. Turned out the card fit perfectly but the frame of the case blocked one of the power taps. I had to replace the case to install this card. If you have a big ol' case don't sweat it, but if you're on a mini-ITX build this is just a heads up.

As for the card itself, I'll start by saying the performance is fantastic. It was an enormous jump from my old GTX 970. I was able to bump everything up from medium/low settings on 1440p up to very high and ultra, and in quite a few cases I can even run games at 2160p or in between high resolutions like 1620p. It's very nice, and the higher resolutions are appreciated since I'm playing on a 4k display.

In terms of power this card is very close in performance with a GTX 1080, and all it really needs for parity with the 1080 is a decent bump in the memory clock which can be attained with MSI Afterburner. Since these 1070 ti cards come at the same base and boost clocks regardless of manufacturer, depending on your luck with the bin you have a lot of headroom for overclocking. I'm currently getting about 50MHz core above stock settings and +350MHz memory clock, and that's an extremely conservative OC. I've read of memory overclocks of up to 900MHz and core clocks at over 2GHz.

So in short, the performance is amazing and more than I even expected. Now, for the drawbacks...

This card runs HOT. The default setup leaves a lot to be desired with the fans running at a measily 2300RPM and barely keeping the card below throttling temperature (83c) by default, or failing at that. I've seen it get up to 83c easily at 1440p and up, and this was with the fan pinned at 100%. My case has good airflow with three noctua 120mm fans, two on intake, one on exhaust, and an additional Antec fan doing intake as well, so it's not a case airflow issue.

I contacted MSI for assistance with the heat assuming maybe there was a BIOS update or something and they just told me it was defective and to send it in to them. They didn't even ask any technical questions about the problem. After research I've found high temps are an issue with the Armor series cards in general, and no, the card is not defective in any way.

There were a couple reasons for the excessive temps:

* The factory thermal paste job was terrible. Thin and bubbled, was not doing decent heat transfer. There was more paste on the board itself than there was on the GPU's chip. :(
* One of the VRM units was completely uncovered by the thermal tape under the cooler block
* The voltage on the card at stock was higher than needed.
* Honestly the Armor's cooling solution in general is underperforming.

I ended up redoing the thermal past with Arctic MX-4, and while I was at it I stretched the thermal tape a bit to cover the last VRM. This alone brought the temps down a few degrees. Then I used MSI Afterburner to do my own voltage control. At stock the card was at 1.031v. It easily maintains the existing boost clocks at 1.000v and in fact boosted higher while staying cooler. Went all the way to 2012MHz on the core boost without really messing with it beyond dropping the power limit. To further control temps though I ended up locking it in at 1949MHz and +350 mem clock at 0.975v. At this voltage the card performs just fine and stays cool. It's generally between 68c and 73c now, with occasional spikes up to 79c if running at 4k on some games. So all told up to a 15c temperature drop.

I'm not really happy with MSI's support service on this, nor the cooler's design, as it's really underwhelming. That said, it is extremely quiet. You can't even hear the thing when the fan is running 100% full tilt. That said, if you're willing to put in some work the card can run cool and fast, and performs great. But if you have room in your case, I'd probably recommend getting the 1070 ti Gaming or Titanium over the Armor series, even if they're a bit pricier. It's my understanding they run much cooler out of the box.

All told, despite the issues getting temps under control I'm happy with the 1070 ti Armor's performance and would generally recommend it, but only if you're willing to put in a bit of extra effort to optimize the performance and experience with it.."

Bought this to replace my 2 year old Radeon R9 390 that kicked the bucket. Fine by me I hated that card from day 1.

This beast maxes out everything I throw at it @ 2K resolution. Ashes of the SIngularity, Ghost Recon: Wildlands and Witcher 3 all 60+ FPS maxed out 2K. Was easily able to get the core to 2ghz and the memory to 4.8ghz rock solid stable without much effort and the best part is the temps stay well below 70c in games, only getting to 68c max when stressing the card for OC stability. A far cry from the 88-92c my R9 390 gamed at. It's also dead silent too. never hear the fans at all, period.

Love MSI products. I went with Asus Strix on the R9 390 and regretted it. Loved my MSI GTX 770 that was also cool and quiet. didn't think twice about going back to MSI. Glad to be back. NOTE: for those who are wondering about the difference between the MSI 1070Ti Gaming X and this Titanium, they are the exact same card, the only difference is the Titanium has 1 more heat pipe and higher quality thermal paste. This equates to about a 3-5c decrease in temps average. With the way GPU Boost 3/4 work, temps play a large factor in how far it will boost. Though it irrelevant if OC'ing (no point not to). Though even max OC'ing the Titanium will be a tad bit cooler (and thus quieter) over the Gaming X.

Achieved a 14.1k 3D score in PassMark. A good friend of mines overclocked GTX 1080 FE achieved a 13.7k."

The card is a killer at max 1080p and max 1440p settings; I haven't tried 4k resolution yet. The overclock ability is standard as all previous MSI cards, each different MSI version card over clocks differently. My overclock is core +150, memory +400. GamersNexus said that he achieved core+200 and memory +500 which is according to MSI the highest any of the Duke cards will achieve unless you buy and overclock the titanium version; at this point it's based off of silicon lottery. This card compares well with the price of 450USD against 1080 card(500USD) and RTX 2080(550+USD).

I expect my card to last as long as the fans do (6+years) as I don't upgrade much. I agree with GamersNexus in each point he and his team brings up and if you can buy the card for about 450USD or less it's be worth it. The card stays around 43C idle with a fan curve of 60%@45C and 100%@65C. Yes the card has the zero spin option where when below 60C but I find a cooler card is a happy card but I set the fan curve to 20%@70C when I'm sleeping. What I have found out about this card is that it will never achieve below 60C idle unless you have a crazy amount of airflow or your ambient temperatures are quite low.

I have had this card for two months and will periodically update this review as I do for all other computer hard ware reviews.

I think the card has gotten up to 81° C, which is within the operating range. I use this card to play Overwatch on a 1440p, 165hz Dell S2417DG g-sync monitor. My CPU is an i5-4670k (not overclocked). I can maintain 162 FPS (limited in-game because I'm using g-sync) on Medium-High settings and 100% render scale. The card does get to 162 fps on Ultra, but will dip to as low as 119 fps during intense team fights. The graphical differences between Ultra and Medium are minimal, and the only setting that really makes the game go from beautiful to a mess of a jagged, aliased lines is the render scale."

These games I run 3840x2460p at 60fps and they do really well. I’m not sure what the cost for these cards are but I think they are worth the money whatever it is. The cooling is superb and with the msi control system you can activate the cooling fans which these have 3 of. For good gaming get there.

MSI makes solid, quality products, and this is no exception. Solid backplate, three large fans, runs (relatively) cool and quiet. Honestly this card is overkill for the types of games that I play, but it's nice to be VR capable and a bit future-proof on modern titles. This card can run anything I can think of to try at well over 100fps with maximum details/settings at 1080p.

If you want ray tracing, obviously go with the newer 2000 series cards, but otherwise, the performance difference between this generation of cards and the newer ones really does not at all justify the price difference. And unless you are a die hard ray tracing fan on principle (because there still aren't really many titles that utilize it well yet), or are trying to run 4k, max settings, a card like this will be plenty to do anything you want.

I will say, GPU sag is a real thing and this card demonstrates it wonderfully. Sags considerably towards to back of the card, so would recommend a GPU bracket of some kind to support it."

If you're looking for top of line GPU brand, MSI is the go-to GPU brand.
The Twin Frozr VI cooling solution is probably one of the best in the game. Better heatsink, better fan quality to ensure you get the maximum cooling when using the afterburner OC software.

Returned the first one and had to wait another week to get the replacement. After installing the DVD disc that came with it, I could only get the same screen on my 3 monitors. I found a newer driver file on their website. After a lengthy download and install I was then able to have different screens on my 3 monitors. After a few days a blue screen appears stating a video error and locks up the computer. After numerous Google search suggested solutions (that did not fix the error) my computer locked up and after a restart I could not log in. After reviewing the user comments on Amazon.com for this card, I found many others had experienced the same blue screen error finding an incompatibility with Windows 10. I returned this card and purchased a GeForce GXT 1660 that I have to wait for a week to receive. I hope the GPU ""soap opera"" is over, Ugh!"

Also, it has horrific compatibility from AMD. Reached out to Gigabyte, and they basically say ""buy a new car, and try it"" ""it's not our fault""

First of all, you don't buy this card cause you have a boat load of money. Second, if a manufacer says that, I can clearly say I have to take the $209 hit and buy something FAR better then this.

Second of all, the driver support is horrific. I have been getting nothing but VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE for the past 2 months. I update the driver, reinstall windows, uninstall drivers Etc. you name it I've done it.

DO NOT BUY THIS CARD. IT IS ABSOUTELY HORRIBLE AND A WASTE OF MONEY.

Gigabyte makes excellent GPUs and motherboards. The drivers for the Navi series are horrible. You do not get consistent, fluid gameplay but instead a laggy mess.

Gigabyte, again, nothing against you. In fact, I'm returning this to get a 2070 Super. Nvidia has much better drivers and software.

This card is a beast and more than worth it for that price point. This card has dipped down to 350 a couple times already, so I'd wait to grab it when it dips down again(seems to be once every 3 weeks).

Aesthically, the cooler is nice and sleek looking. All black is a huge bonus for my build. No rgb integration is a bonus for me as well. Only con here is there isn't a back plate, which is fine with me and not a surprise at this price point. if you plan to water cool it you won't know it's gone. Pretty easy to make a cheap backplate from acrylic if you need it.

Support wise all the drivers worked right away from evgas website. Ddu'd my amd drivers slapped this card in and downloaded the 20 series drivers from evga and got my full resolution immediately. Running win 10 64 bit.

Performance. The card is rock solid. Running Bl3 on ultra and can't cap out my frames on my 1440 165hz monitor. The stock cooler is pretty good and keeps my card within the prime operating Temps. It can be pretty loud if it's under a huge load and running full blast, but the only time that happened was when I stress tested it.

Just so you aren't as confused as I was, the free game doesn't come from Amazon. Go to evga's website and register your card and submit your invoice for the game code. Website said it may take 3 days but I got my code 2 hours after submitting.

10/10 reccomend upgrading to this card if it's within that sweet 3 iteration upgrade mark for you. Plus evga has good customer support and painless rma turn around. Also if you are waiting for the 30 series, you are in the time frame now to pick this card up then pay the difference between what you paid and the upgrade cards cost for their upgrade program.

Update 6 months in:
Card still running strong. For anyone who is turned off by the reports of fans revving up and down while idle, just install msi afterburner and set the fans to constantly run at 10-20% and the issue is solved.

This card has moved to running on a 1440p 144hz uw monitor. Specifically MAG321CQR. Still using borderlands 3 as the benchmark. Under capped out setting, I pull a consistent 80-85 fps in high action areas. The card does run at 80 degrees, but that is more of a case of choice issue that will be solved by adjusted how the airflow hits my case. I was able to oc the card for about 7% performance boost, and will return to review again once I get a stable undervolt running. I still feel the card is a steal at 350, but at 400 I'd wait awhile as Nvidia will be announcing the 3k series in August 2020"

For the price, I would say it's a good deal. The RX 5700 XT is priced around the same as this card's MSRP value (around $399), and from the benchmarks I've seen, is about 10% faster. However, at the time I was shopping for a new card, AMD was still suffering from some driver issues. I have heard most of these issues are resolved now. Might be worth looking at a RX 5700 XT instead, especially if you can find one on sale.

This RTX 2060 Super is great for 1080p gaming on max settings. I would highly recommend pairing it with a 120hz or 144hz monitor since you will easily be pushing 60+ fps on max settings in all games on 1080p. If you're going to be gaming at 1440p instead, then maybe consider looking at a RTX 2070 Super also if that's within your budget.

I upgraded from a GTX 970, which couldn't even hit 60fps in RDR2 on high settings in 1080p. Don't have an issue with that now. Temps and noise are also about the same as my old GTX 970. I hit about 70C-ish degrees when gaming. I also have not had any driver issues a couple other reviews noted.

One thing to remember is to register your card with EVGA and to redeem your free game codes. There is a limited amount of time you are able to do it, so don't forget."

However, when doing things that shouldn't be stressing the card at all (and temp monitors have shown no temp spiking) the fans will occasionally rev up, loudly for half-second spurts. It's very annoying."

The second card seems to perform better in benchmarks over the first (bios looked to be a different version). Install was a breeze. When gaming the fans run constantly which isn't an issue except the fans have an odd sound that is noticeable and not the typical fan spinning sound.

Also the second card most of the screws to hold on the fan shroud were loose out of the box.

For those who don't care about noise of the fans this card should perform well but if you are looking for a quiet card even when gaming I would say you may want to look elsehwere.

Update , down to two stars, the card keeps running the fan at full speed when the card temp is low, EVGA support has ignored my requests for help and a fix. If you want a quiet card buy something else."

I have not had an issue since i did that. You really should not need to do that with a card from EVGA. I expect better.

So far, it performs well, and hasn't broken. If it makes it through a few years and still functions, it'll be a great card. Until then, it's a 2060.
Though I will say it gets hot when under load, and this causes the fans to kick into an overdrive, but they don't stay in overdrive, and speed up and down frequently. I foresee this as a problem, and I'll have to mitigate it by ensuring the fans stay clean so that any buildup does not cause a loss in functionality. Likely, this is an issue with case airflow, and I'll take the blame on that since I've been neglecting a case upgrade for a few years now."

This card definitely meets all the standards you need for a video card for today's games. No issues with performance.

Cons: Every so often the fans will go into overdrive and they are loud as hell. It's as if a jet took off for 5 seconds and then it goes back to being silent. Please know this is how it is right out of the box with no overclocking or tweaking. The card will randomly do this even with no game going. I read this in other reviews on here, but I figured they may have heating issues or maybe a defective card...nope. I have debated returning, but the time it will take to return and get a different card vs being down for a week is constant battle in my head.

If you don't mind random sounds of fans going into overdrive, this card will do everything it's designed to do from the performance side. If you absolutely hate loud fan noises at all, I would look in another direction."

I tried the one mentioned above and I can guarantee that there is no comparison when performing renderings or even maneuvering through a 3D model that is not compiled and is editable on the fly. The render times for the images above dropped 75% from my old Quadrro K1200 in very overclocked 4th gen Core i7-4770K system overclocked to 5.8Ghz. That means they took only 1.5 minutes to create. This is an 8 Gb AutoCAD Architecture file completely furnished inside and I am so impressed. Animations are done 10x faster than before. What used to take overnight is done in under 3 hours. Gotta say it was worth the the price and if I had it to spend I would get the RTX5000 as it has even better potential. By the way the 2080 card couldn't even complete a rendering without the system resetting.
I will add the I am talking about a brand new Core i9-10900K system w/64 Gb of DDR4-3600 ram Dual Samsung 970 Pro SSD and the motherboard is the Asus Maximus XII Hero overclocked to the max 5.3Ghz on all cores with an 850w power supply in the biggest case known to man the Corsair Graphite 760T and of course the Kraken tripple fan cooler. I also added a slew of other fans to fill every available space. I've been building systems since the first 8088 clones came out and never stopped. Computer Gear Head here!"

WRONG! I bought a really high end video cable to replace the NEW one I had just bought a week before which was a cheap low end.

I understand that coil whine is inherent at certain levels for high end graphics cards, but the amount of coil whine in this card was extreme. It became a huge annoyance that wouldn't go away. I contacted EVGA and work through trouble shooting steps (Try in different build and run a benchmark program for hours to try to burn it in). The coil whine never went away after hours upon hours and it still had bad coil whine in a different build.

I don't have anything that uses DLSS or RTX, so I can't speak to how those work, but what I can say is that it is significantly faster than my 1080 was, and I feel like the colors and animations, even on Windows Aero stuff, is smoother, and looks better.

After constant driver crashes I was ready to return to the green team, and boy am I happy I did! This thing's been a dream come true.

I used to feel like my gpu was bottle necking my monitor, now it's the other way around. Thanks for the awesome graphics card at an awesome price.

I will say there IS coil whine like the reviews say, it's true. However, it doesn't really occur unless you're putting it under heavy load, but under heavy load can be decently loud. If you have your PC on a desk next to you, then you might want to use a headset. If you have it under your desk somewhere, you probably won't notice unless your house is quiet enough to hear a pin drop a room away. Definitely can't hear it over my AC, or a fan on the other side of the room, a TV a few rooms away, etc.

I take off a star because there are no particular directions included about how to install it.
I'm sure installing this is a no brainer if you've done this before, but that's not me.
Physically it went right in without a problem. However there was a question about what to do with the old display drivers, which you have to somehow remove before you install the new drivers. On-line I found folks who suggested strongly that you physically delete all drivers from your hard disk; some folks said you need to deactivate the old drivers from the BIOS boot screen; Some said you just have to go into Windows control panel and deactivate the drivers there, no physical deleting necessary. This seemed the least radical approach so that's what I did. Then rebooted. I installed the new drivers from the provided disk and everything went pretty well. I did not download the newest drivers from the web site because, again, careful instructions were not provided and I didn't want to risk the trials and troubles of doing it wrong since everything worked fine using the drivers on the CD. I'm not using this for gaming, so I'm not worried about missing out on a bit of performance."

But, I have bought two of these cards recently (one a replacement) and they both have loud whining fans. I originally bought this same card 5 years ago and the fan sound was very quiet until about a month ago when it started whining. The sound is very annoying and high pitched. Where is the quality control on these fans? Other buyers must have the same problem? I would like to hear if their fans are also loud.

Upon further investigation, I have determined that the ""high pitch whine"" I experienced and read many other reports on this card on the internet is actually ""Coil Whine"" in the motherboard. The MB is 5 years old and I never had this noise before now. This is something I never knew existed before - a new issue with me. Nor have I ever had it on a previous MB.

So... what cost this board a star? I have never experience coil whine like I did with this card. It could be the setup (old board, old PSU), but I'm hoping that the whine will go away soon-ish. I game with headphones on, and I didn't notice the whine until I took them off, and oh boy, can't miss that noise.

Also, this is a heavy card, which means there is some flex between the mount point and the end of the card. When I tried adjusting the end of the card to be level with the mount point, the fans seemed like they got stuck and made rattling noises until the card dipped back to what it was.

Bottom line, if your looking for a quiet RX 580, skip this card."

Plays games maxed out smooth as silk, they look great and excellent 1080p I have not had a hiccup yet. My case has plenty of fans so I don't hear the fan often if at all because when I game I use headphones, the fan turns on at about 70c if I remember right so just browsing I don't hear it ever. This is obviously a card that will perform for a few years especially if you are like me and 1080p is good enough, 4k will be a different story but I don't plan on that due to lack of content."

It also gets VERY loud when the fans are at 100%, but I cannot say that besides manually running them that fast, I have never had them go above 60% during heavy usage. So it is generally quiet, but if for some reason it needs to crank up the fans, it sounds like a jet engine.
It does exactly as advertised as it reaches 1350mhz (the advertised speed) and that gets me an average of 80fps in gta 5 on max settings and I haven't had the opportunity to play other games with it yet. For the price, cant do much better

VERY cost effective","First off, I upgraded from a 1050ti and it was a very nice upgrade. I've had this card for about 5 months and here are some things I like and dislike.

I love the amount of power you get for the price. It does very well at 1080 high/ultra. It was a big upgrade from my old 1050ti. I like that it has a nice plate over the PCB and makes it look very nice. But there are some drawbacks. It can get very noisy while running at 100% usage. It can also get a bit toasty in your case. I do have it overclocked to 1425Mhz. So only about 75 extra Mhz. When I had it running at stock there wasn't really any coil whine that I could hear, but when I overclocked it I couldn't definintly hear a bit of coil whine, but dont worry that is not bad for your graphics card and it won't harm it.

Overall I think it is a very nice card and I'm taking off a star just because its a bit loud but hey, can't really complain for the price."

 This is the fastest low profile card there is right now, but the Zotac one seems to have pretty loud fans. With fan speeds above 50% (which it will surpass in any normal gameplay) it is comparable to a 1U rack server. Coming from an MSI 1050 Ti LP, the fans are very notably louder. The fans have an audible tone to them like a leafblower or quadcopter propellers (that can be heard at idle temps), while the MSI 1050 Ti fan noise is more like a ""whoosh"" with no tone.

I've included a video recording of what the 1650 (silver card, 1st in video) sounds like at max fan speed. At the end I put a clip of the MSI 1050 Ti (black card) for comparison.

If you don't care about noise levels this is the best LP card to get, it has a Displayport while the MSI 1650 does not, and costs less.

Other than the fan issue, performance is a decent improvement over 1050 Ti. The 1650 scored 5146 on Superposition High 1080p while the 1050 Ti scored 3973. This equated to about 10 more FPS overall in this benchmark. It may not be worth upgrading from a 1050 Ti, but if you have anything lower this is the one to get."

Yes, the rx570 for less money destroys this card but if you need a SFF graphics card that does not need any external PCIe power this card is for you.

Even at first install, you'll notice a sound volume increase. Speaking of install; getting the drivers to work right nearly drove me insane. Windows 10 has been around for awhile now, it should not have been so aggressively annoying (clean win10 install, OS required a bunch of updates before driver worked).

I will state yes it can get Audible loud to the point it’s annoying. At least compared to my previous card. I mainly experience it with heavier demanding games like COD but for more causal and less demanding games it remains quiet.

However,

Despite it running loud with certain games the performance is great, definitely a improvement! I’m upgrading from a GT1030 inside a Dell Opti 790. So despite the fan being annoyingly loud at points it’s something I can personally say is worth the increased in performance. Especially since I’m limited in choices.

Why the 3 Stars?

I’m not completely happy because of the fan, Honestly if the card was cheaper I probably wouldn’t even be that upset about the sound of the fans.

The size is perfect for any mid-sized tower. And despite it not having the GPU power as it's bigger and externally powered siblings it still holds it's own for gaming. I found that because the processors are so new that I was having issues with some 3D modeling/rendering software being compatible with it and my system would crash as soon as I tried to open the software. Video editing software had no issues. So, good for gaming but not for 3D production. If you really need GPU power, this could be your side boo, but not your main squeeze when it comes to GPU rendering."

I generally consider $300 about the highest I'll go on a new card and AMD released this card right into that sweet spot.

Installed this on a:
Ryzen 2600
16GB Corsair LBX 3000
MSI Tomahawk B350
EVGA 500w Bronze PSU

The card is built well and had no problems getting it installed. Of course, their is the issue with the need to update the video BIOS of the 5600XT cards in order to unlock the full core clock speeds. But when I loaded the updated BIOS from the PowerColor website, I discovered that the card I received already had the update. I loaded up the drivers and all seemed well at first. But then noticed that the fans were not spinning at all. Thought maybe the power management just didn't need the fans at idle. So, ran a benchmark and the fans still didn't spin. Looked in the AMD Software Center and the junction temps were at 71c, the fans should have definitely been spinning. I had to go into the tuning tab of the AMD software and manually tune the fans. Then, after a bit of nonsensical fiddling with the fan curves they started spinning. The temps quickly went down to 46c once I started getting the speeds up to 1700 RPM. So, the cooler, well you know, is actually cooling it works pretty good. But, I noticed that whenever I exited out of the tuning page of the AMD software the manual tuning on the fan curves would reset themselves back to defaults. The fans would keep spinning at this point but they'd only turn at 750 RPM because the default curves are ridiculously conservative. Consequently the temps would start to rise back up to 60c. Turns out this is a common problem with the Radeon drivers with a number Radeon cards. So, if you're looking for the 5600XT to possibly fix this problem. That would be a big, NO!

But the problems with the Radeon drivers just don't stop at the fan speed issues. The overall system stability is just atrocious. Games would just randomly crash, especially when trying to load a level. Sometimes the screen would just go completely black and the only way to get out of it was a hard boot. One time the hardware on the card itself locked up with magenta sprites all over the screen. The final nail in the coffin was when a game unexpectedly crashed in the middle of playing a game. The resultant error was reported from DxDiag with a message indicating that a problem with the underlying hardware was detected and to check and verify the voltages to the GPU. I just gave the power button the one finger salute, pulled the card out of the computer, and promptly threw it back into the box for a refund.

It's a shame that AMD just can't get their act together on the video card front. Their CPU's are great and I've had no problems with the Ryzen 2600....and Nvidia graphics. As far as the stats go the performance of the 5600XT is pretty impressive. I scored a 6719 on Time Spy and a 17720 on Firestrike, 3dMark benchmarks. The Furmark power bug pushed the card to around 150w at the Turbo clock of 1640 Mhz. From reviews I was expecting to go upwards of 180w but this card on my system just didn't seem to need that much juice. And my digital power meter showed my system running 250w which is just right in the wheel house of the 500w PSU. Alas, I was really hoping this card would turn out nice. It seemed like just an easy drop in upgrade for my system. And one would expect that an AMD video card would pair nicely with an AMD CPU. But, as it seems to be a continuing trend with AMD video cards, the video drivers are just hot steaming piles of manure. I really can't fault PowerColor for making what otherwise seems to be a nice set of hardware. But as they say, Garbage in/Garbage Out. You can have the nicest hardware in the world but if the software is pumping in garbage, well that's what you can expect to get."

One week after:
I think I will return this card. My FPS goes from 200 to 98 and so. The fans never go above 800rpm so I guess the card is not performing at its best. I will definitely return it and get the rx580 or 590 since it is cheaper and still good."

This review is for the fact it's a $320-400 card shipped in its retail box. Porch pirates are a real problem in many areas, mostly densely populated, and if a plain cardboard can be alluring then a shiny red box covered in PC specs and a dragon-head is almost certainly going to attract the wrong person if you live in an area plagued by it.

The card has mixed opinions online regarding BIOS flashing, and I'll address that when/if I experience that. For now, while I was home due to restrictions and I live in a relatively problem-free area, I got a spike of anxiety when the driver (cool, kind guy himself) handed me a retail box with a shipping label affixed.

If you're a kid in some highly populated urban area who saved up $300+ for this, it would be heart-wrenching to have it snatched. They'd have, I imagine, zero recourse aside from potential security footage and local enforcement. Or a kind Amazon employer may fix it out of sympathy, but doubtful.

I'll probably give it max 4 stars because of this, even if it works flawlessly. It's far too risky to advertise your expensive purchases by leaving them in a retail box on your stoop. If possible, I would order this gift-boxed or to a more ""secure"" address. Like I said, I was fine but there are plenty of scenarios that could have ended badly. If you live in a rowhouse next to less savory people and are at work all day, I imagine this thing is gone before you come home, and that sucks to experience (i had it happen with an xbox 360 a decade ago at a cruddy apartment...).

Heed my warning if you want this card but live in an untrustworthy neighborhood."

After some research to bring myself up to speed with the current market, a few cards matched my performance requirements, within my price bracket.

A little more research and the RX580 8GB seemed to be the card to get. It then boiled down to design of the card. As my PC has a blue theme and this card has colour changing LEDs onboard, this seemed an obvious choice. The additional second bios for slightly more processing power also swayed me.

So far, no issues. Easy to install, drivers were straight from the AMD website and the included fans can be easily swapped out which is another bonus - fan failure doesn't mean card failure.

The card itself runs smoothly, rarely stutters in games (I usually run all in Ultra or equivalent settings). The fans on the card come on during higher temperatures. At idle the card is silent and has a tiny power draw.

Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this card.

So, I bough the Sapphire Radeon Nitro + RX 580 8GB, which I don't consider to be overly expensive. I received a free game out of the deal so perhaps my grandchildren, when they visit, may appreciate it. It's a large card,takes a tad over two spaces, in fact it partially covers the second of the M.2 slots, so there may be problems for some of you there. Also, the length of the card, I have an NZXT H440 RED/Black Mid-Tower Case and it's just got enough breathing room to insert the card correctly. This was the other difficulty I had, it might be just me, I've just turned 65 years of age, bit of a tremor in my hands, but I had a bit of a problem lining up the card correctly with the first PCIe slot. I knew I was nearly there because all the various display port were lined up correctly out of the back of my PC, it was just to make sure that the card was aligned correctly with the #1 PCIe lane, that took a little while to judge, but I got there in the end. Power cables going in, 6pin + 8 pin, again took time but then I have a beQuiet Dark Power Pro 11 850W Fully Modular and the cabling that comes with that is thick and not very yielding. However, apart from all the trials and tribulations of an old man ( I do have plenty of experience when it comes to building my own rigs, this is my 7th, and probably last), the card worked a treat, no adjustment necessary, straight out of the box, great graphics, excellent picture on my Dell S2719DC FreeSync Monitor.

My old GPU was an MSI Amor RX 580 and this is just so much better made and feels much higher quality. Performance etc, well lots of reviews on the internet. As to the RGB on it, download Trixx Nitro Glow, set the colour, et voila. Probably the go to card if you want an RX 580 really.

[edit] I just wanted to add, I advise purchasing some form of GPU support at the same time as purchasing this. After a while, my card started to show a definite sag, only slight, but I should imagine that given time this would have increased. A friend noticed an even bigger sag. You can see the support I purchased in the latest photo I have added. It really is a heavy cooler on this card."

 IM REALLY IMPRESSED by the material , Fast delivery and performance of this Card.

I had the same exact RX 580 From MSI and looked cheap and noisy....and more money.

The card is long so you have to have a good case for it... in my case it fitted perfectly as Seen in the photos!

I tried the card Playing R6 Siege at ultra Settings at 60fps and it was incredible at 2k resolution..

Der Sapphire Schriftzug ist LED beleuchtet und lässt sich genau wie OC und Lüftersteuerung über die Sapphire Software steuern.
Wer möchte kann die Lüfter noch Werkzeuglos (jeweils 1 kleine Schraube pro Lüfter, ansonsten Stecksystem) gegen Nitro Gear RGB Lüfter tauschen.

Insgesamt sehr durchdachte schnelle und leise RX 580.

Über die Leistung der RX 580 Karten mit 8 GB brauche ich wohl nichts mehr sagen.
Preis-Leistungs technisch wird jede 1060 in die Tasche gesteckt. Hierzu gibt es auch zahlreiche Videos und Reviews online.

Update:

Nach einigen Tagen Nutzung nun nochmal mehr Feedback. Habe sie auf 1475 MHz und 2100 RAM übertaktet, läuft sehr stabil. Fifa 19 Ultra und alles was geht 120 FPS in FHD, Assasins Creed Odyssey Ultra FHD 85-105 FPS. Ich für meinen Teil bin sehr zufrieden, sollte für FHD noch einige Zeit reichen."

Only 70% load running BF1 on ultra @1080, which makes for cooler temps.

Knew going in that this beast was a three slot card and had no issue with that. What I was looking for was a powerful card with a beefy heat sink, exceptional cooling, and quiet fans, and this baby delivers.

Highest temp I have seen running Furmark was 67c in my Full Tower case, and with that low temp the cards fans were only spinning 960rpm. As most of you know a GTX 1070ti is a powerful card so no need to rehash that. Have not noticed any coil whine whatsoever.

Fans of EVGA who want a powerful graphics card but also value a cool running card with silence, your ship has come in.

I play at 1080p only because I'm not gonna chase the 4k dragon. Only game I've had to drop settings on was GTA V, not terribly surprised on that (had to do a fair bit of tweaking b/c I kept getting freeze frames, but curse those shadows they were the culprit!), though if I felt like watercooling and overclocking I'd probably be able to keep it maxed. But I don't, so I don't.

If you're looking to play Skyrim special edition maxed (even with some higher res mods), Fallout 4 maxed, SC 2 maxed, D3 maxed, that sort of thing, and just on 1080p, I can attest that this card more than does the job.

This card is a beast. Runs so cool and quiet. If you are looking for a budget 1080 or 1080 TI then just get this card. its too hard to find a well priced 1080 and if you overclock this will run better than a 1080 and just under the 1080 TI.

But it was not a necessary buy, the 960 was good enough for all my needs I just got a little greedy.

So in that mode works like a charm and between 100 - 200 FPS in full quality, looks premium materials easy to install and nothing of noise, in windows 34ºC and in game 45ºC until now, when i did the oc scanner taked 80ºC before the big fail system and well then check the forums and yes, lots of users with the same problem so if you want overclock it use other programs to test the parameters and then set the profiles. Dont get me wrong, its an awesome graphic card but becarefull with the oc scanner i dont recomend it.

After 3 or 4 months of use, i not recommend this blower, has very poor ventilation perfomance and the card gets top temp 85 C in almost 15 minutes with 28 ambient. With all my previus cards never get to dim temp to protect the card and still get out inside the tower a lot of heat. Save a few bucks and get traditional ventilation."

My card gets a stable +225 offset on the core and +300 on the memory. While that memory offset isn’t that great for pascal, the core frequency adds much more performance.

Going with water over air cooling may not get you much higher overclocks due to power constraints from Nvidia. However, it will give you frequencies that are more STABLE at the higher end if you’re using GPU boost (stock) or if you’re overclocking. My card stays locked at 2126 MHz at all times. This let’s frame times remain extremely constant for a much better experience. You don’t notice dips in frequency and frame rate, so you can just get lost in the experience.

Also a plus is that it only needs one 8-pin cable from the PSU.

My only complaints are aesthetic. The card itself is rather ugly. The lighting is static white, not RGB, and the shroud is an ugly gray beige. Neutral is good, but it’s not nearly as appealing as the other EVGA pascal cards.

All in all, this is a good purchase if you care about frames per dollar."

It eats through 1080p and can chip 4k away at a pretty fast rate as well.

I'm at 1080p and pretty much run everything I've played at ultra with no issues. I actually had one of these get fried by a bad liquid cpu cooler and bought an identical replacement because, to be honest, I love the look of it. I like that the GPU title is RGB. Since I spent so much on the card I like that I get to literally highlight it. It has a nice, solid metal backplate, and generally has a sense of high build quality. It doesn't expose so much of its innards like so many cards and the aesthetic feels luxurious without resorting to the hokey plastic Lamborghini-esque form language of a lot of graphics cards on the market. It feels like a machine rather than a toy. Personally, beyond the added benefit of the extra-thick heatsink in regards to temperature and noise, I just find the heft of this card satisfying. Once again, it's the ""I spent so much on this that I want it to feel like I got something for my money"" thing."

But I have to tell you guys that i had a problem of coil whine in few days of use it, so i called amazon tech support and i told my problem so they connected me to evga support care and they told me that place the gpu on flat surface and press the both fans with your thumb very gently
So I tried that and I’m glad that after a half hour of watch dogs 2 with every thing on ultra settings there is no coil whine any more

Before that as soon as the fan is start i heard the coil whine but now it’s great

And one thing more after half our of gameplay the temperature is max at 65 degree which is awesome

So thanks amazon and evga"

Inside the box was just a video card in a plastic case, no install cd, no extra cords, no protective film, no install instructions.

1) To answer some questions about the power source cables, the video card is powered by a 8-pin. My PSU only has 8-pin to 6+2 pin. You can use this 6+2 pin to power the 8 pin. My is powered fine this way.

2) I was having serious stuttering on videos/games after the installation of the card. There was a simple fix that resolved this issue. Go to NVIDIA Control Panel>Manage 3D Settings. Scroll down to Maximum pre-rendered frames and set the value to 1. This fixed everything for me (additionally which helped my last card, change preferred refresh rate to highest available and vertical sync set to off)

Other than that, the card is working as intended, my frames have gone up in all my games, Fallout76 went from 50 FPS to 135 FPS."

It has lots of room for easy overclocking and will has lower temps than it's fan GPU counterparts. However I am returning it due to the pump being too loud. While gaming it's fine and is easy drowned out by music or even louder CPU/Case fans. I work from home and while working the pump is the only item I hear.. mind you my case is below my desk, about 4 feet from where I work. The other thing I'll say - the fan on the radiator will run at a constant 100% unless you plug it directly into your MOBO or fan controller. I replaced the fan with a noctua and plugged into my MOBO, which is how I realized the noise was from the pump itself. I love EVGA and will continue buying their products but I wish they'd use a better radiator than this subpar Antek."

Also excuse my horrible cable management. Probably the best thing about it is how cool it runs- and its easily the quietest card I've ever owned. I game in 1080p so I can't speak for UHD gaming, but it auto-defaults everything I own to max settings. I run it at stock settings as I don't have any need to overclock. In the current marketplace; I still don't see the reason to go to a higher card unless you're doing heavy 4k gaming and just want the best of the best.. I couldn't justify getting anything more expensive for what I needed.

The build quality is superb. If I need to stretch to find something critical- possibly the XOC software could use a bit of polishing, and the RGB could be a tad more vivid, but really I'm splitting hairs.. This is the best bang for the buck and I imagine it will be for awhile- you can't go wrong here."

That said I only really play Final Fantasy XIV right now, but I wanted to future proof while the price was low. (Sadly this card's price has been bouncing around like crazy. The day I bought it was $399 a few hours later it was $429, the day after $549, now it's back to $499.)
Anyways, it over clocked extremely well with the XOC software to +114Mhz overclock. I intend to overclock my CPU soon too for more juice after I get a better cooler, but it ran the FFXV benchmark on high settings with 75-90fps. FFXIV it runs at 90-160fps on MAX 1080p depending on if I'm in the thick of the action or just standing around in the housing wards.

I tried the one mentioned above and I can guarantee that there is no comparison when performing renderings or even maneuvering through a 3D model that is not compiled and is editable on the fly. The render times for the images above dropped 75% from my old Quadrro K1200 in very overclocked 4th gen Core i7-4770K system overclocked to 5.8Ghz. That means they took only 1.5 minutes to create. This is an 8 Gb AutoCAD Architecture file completely furnished inside and I am so impressed. Animations are done 10x faster than before. What used to take overnight is done in under 3 hours. Gotta say it was worth the the price and if I had it to spend I would get the RTX5000 as it has even better potential. By the way the 2080 card couldn't even complete a rendering without the system resetting.
I will add the I am talking about a brand new Core i9-10900K system w/64 Gb of DDR4-3600 ram Dual Samsung 970 Pro SSD and the motherboard is the Asus Maximus XII Hero overclocked to the max 5.3Ghz on all cores with an 850w power supply in the biggest case known to man the Corsair Graphite 760T and of course the Kraken tripple fan cooler.

I bought the card for MSRP(999). I think for that money the card is a good value. But there are some flaws you have to deal with. First of all, the card shroud feels flimsy. It's thin plastic that creaks under pressure. That should not be on something that cost this much even when it's an entry level RTX 2080 ti card. Another important thing is that the card can get pretty audible while gaming. It's not super loud, but loud enough to be noticeable compared to my old card which was a GTX 1080 FE. Though it could be my fault since my case is small and not ideal for open cooler. The card runs in the mid 70s c and maxes out at 80c. The card can maintain around 1700-1800 MHz but didn't try overclocking. You should not buy this expecting to get higher clock speed considering it was running pretty warm already.

edit: Like I suspected, my case was very restrictive on the card. After I opened up my case, the card ran significantly cooler and quieter. It never went over 70c and stayed around 60% fan speed. I think at what I paid for, it's the best value RTX 2080 ti on the market. It actually beats founder edition card in quietness and temperature. It also boosted much higher close to 1900 MHz - 1950 MHz with a minor undervolt."

5.) Reinstalling my OS and repeating the aforementioned actions^^^ Every... Single... One...

If I weren't so hopeful, I would give up on this card entirely... AMD cards look mightily enticing at this point, however Even after all this heartache, I am willing to give the benefit of doubt and send it to get it repaired. Hopefully I can receive a functioning card. In the meantime my 600$ is still, just an investment.

Other than that, at least it looked nice inside the PC.
Really good quality build. The heatsink is massive and the fans run quietly; great work ASUS. Maybe the repaired or replaced card i might receive wont be just a paperweight this time..."

Got this one to replace my 970. So far I love it. I was going to get a 1080 but this was reported to be as good or better so why not go with the latest. Price is a bit steep but not horrible. On par with a 1080 so no reason not to go 2070. The 1080TI was too much.

Unsure the bad reviews, not counting bad cards, this runs everything as expected and runs very cool. I have my card mounted vertically and so far no issues. Runs very cool and quite. Getting a new 144Hz monitor today so we will see how it performs using that. I will edit this if I have any issues.

Edit: I had an issue with it. I was gaming and the card just died. It was running fine, screen just went black and the card failed. I do not mess with OC-ing etc.. Unsure if it was the card, PS or MB. I replaced them and the card and so far the replacement is working fine.

I am no longer using the PCIe extender. That may have been my issue, unsure.

I still like it so only removed one star."

The memory modules inside the card are made by two different companies, Samsung and Micron. Micron memory modules have been experiencing failures across all of the brands and lines of card. Since there is no way to know which company's memory modules are going to be in your card, it's probably best just to stay away from RTX right now."

I’m getting 96-100fps with pubg at 4k.

Pros:
- Can play everything maxed out at 1080 or 1440. Plays lots of games at 4k 60fps
- RGB looks great.
- Raytracing
- streaming rocks!

Cons:
- Certain games will heat up a room quickly. You need to find a way to circulate cold air into the room.
- No SLI! Ugh
- Need g sync monitors to prevent screen tearing.

Final thoughts:
This card is great if you want to taste high end gaming. This card doesn’t feel future proof even with ray tracing because there’s no SLI port. Nvidia got greedy with this card. It’s better than a 1070ti and 1080 in benchmarks. You are probably better off with a 2080 instead."

It died exactly one month after I bought it. Re-installed drivers, OS, card, etc... just wasted a ton of time with it.
So here's what I think:
* Do not buy this card, it's not ready for the consumer market. The amount of folks who report the card dying is just too big to ignore. Do some research on other major e-commerce websites, and you'll see it's even worse than Amazon.
* if you insist on buying this card, buy it from Amazon proper (not ""fulfilled by Amazon""). If you're ""lucky"", it will die on you within the return window and you can return it without incurring additional cost. If you buy it from a third party vendor, they will charge you 20% restocking fee. Yes, I know, I lost $100 playing this little game.
* if it dies on you after the return window, then you'll have the joy of dealing with ASUS's RMA process, and incur additional shipping cost (at a minimum), delays, etc...

So stay away from it at this time, and re-assess in about 6 months to see if the situation improved."

Brownie points to them. Replacement got here the day after I called them. And so far so good. I'm hoping it doesn't die because honestly this thing is amazing when it works. Ultra settings on every game I play and it looks stunning.

Literally went with an all ASUS build. Got everything up and going. Downloaded my games. Got really REALLY excited. 10 seconds in to loading the game. Artifacting. 5 seconds later it froze my computer. Then no display. I'm currently writing this review using the HDMI output from my motherboard. I'm hoping I can get this remedied because I specifically wanted an all ASUS build and this card has been a huge let down. Read around on the internet before you buy. Apparently both the RTX 2070 and the RTX 2080TI's are having this problem."

So disappointing.,"So, far far as 2070 cards go, this one is expensive. However, Asus also probably has the best cooler attached when it comes to thermals vs noise. It even has a bios switch with quiet and performance modes. Quiet mode is extremely quiet while still keeping operable temperatures. Performance mode will give you audible noise, but it will still be cooler and quieter than most of the competition. Only the MSI gaming Z is close. EVGA, despite having excellent warranty support and good pricing, has mediocre coolers.

If you are noise focused and have a little bit of extra cash, this is probably the card you want to go for."

They sent me a replacement next day (which also failed) and easily accepted back both cards with no shipping charge. So thank you Amazon, I appreciate how easy you made this. But you are selling defective cards.

My system:
MSI Z370-a Pro MB
i7-8700k
16 GB ram
EVGA 650w PS

So almost instantly with both cards I got artifacting, then the GPU froze and then crashed the computer, forcing me to restart. This happened anytime that the GPU was under load. I included 4 pictures of the failures that I got. I tried everything to make this work. I uninstalled my old Nvidia drivers, made sure Windows was up to date, checked my power connections, nothing worked. I plugged in an old GTX 1060 to make sure that my computer wasn't the problem, and the 1060 worked perfectly, not problems even after a 20 minute stress test.

After doing some research online, there is some belief that cards made with Micron memory modules were the ones having problems. I looked up what kind this card had using the program GPU-Z and sure enough both cards they sent me had Micron memory. I read that cards manufactured after Jan 2019 use Samsung memory and there is no longer an issue. But the cards I was sent had Micron and failed right out of the box.

Again, the good thing about this is that they failed quickly enough that I could just send them back to Amazon and not have to worry about a manufacturer RMA which could take weeks. If you have this or any other card and it fails after 30 days, Amazon wont accept the return and you will have to get it repaired by the manufacturer. I didn't have to go through that process, but you could be without a graphics card for weeks in that scenario.

If you do decide to buy this card, do a lot of stress testing right away to make sure your card is stable. Run high demanding games and run synthetic benchmarking tests to make sure your 2070 is working. At stock settings, there's no reason a card like this should fail even after hours of game play or testing. I hope this helped, and good luck"
110.0,ASUS GeForce RTX 2070 Overclocked 8G GDDR6 Dual-Fan Edition VR Ready HDMI DP 1.4 USB Type-C Gaming Graphics Card (DUAL-RTX-2070-O8G),ASUS Computer International Direct,Nvidia,14000 MHz,8 GB,$404.04,4.2 out of 5 stars,Initial purchase and replacement both failed right out of the box,"I purchased this card for some light 4k gaming as an upgrade to my Gigabyte GTX 1070. The Strix 2070 has a very impressive build quality, and the look and feel of the card in your hands just oozes quality. I particularly like the wingblade fans and the metal backplate with the illuminated Strix logo.

The performance of this card is in between a GTX 1080 and 1080 Ti. When overclocked, it is closer to a 1080 Ti. I find the performance to be pretty solid for lower refresh rate 4k gaming. I get about 55 fps in the Witcher 3 on ultra with all worthwhile settings maxed out. In Battlefield 5, I get about 70 fps with ray tracing off and 50 fps with ray tracing on medium. In Metro Exodus, I get about 50 fps with ray tracing off and 35-40 fps with ray tracing on. Ray tracing implementation is still pretty underwhelming, but you will get very solid performance at 1080p or 1440p with this card, even with ray tracing turned on.

The thermal performance of this card is fantastic, and I'm pretty sure no other RTX 2070 comes close to matching this thermal performance. This card has a huge triple-slot heatsink with three fans, and the heat spreader is ultra smooth thanks to Asus' max contact technology. My card usually hovers around 60 C under 100% load, and the fans are barely audible at these temps, even with the performance BIOS enabled (instead of the quiet BIOS). Since my case is right on my desk, I really appreciate how quiet this card is.

So far, I have only played around a little with overclocking. Nvidia's GPU boost already adjusts the clock speed on my card as high as 2050 mhz, but I can't keep it stable that high with a manual overclock. Also, don't use Asus' GPU Tweak II. It's absolutely terrible software. You have to downgrade your DirectX in order to install it. GPU tweak doesn't save your settings, it's buggy, and the on-screen display shows a huge ad for Asus graphics cards right over your game. It's one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.

I was a little disappointed with the fan-side RGB illumination. There are actually just LEDs at either end of the card that light up a sort of fiber optic cable. The lighting is not very bright, and it's also not addressable, so the whole card can only display one color at a time. I may mod the card with some addressable LED strips behind the fiber optic cables.

Many of the other reviews mention artifacting, crashing, etc. I don't doubt that many people have had problems with this card, and with RTX cards in general, but I think the reviews here don't accurately reflect most people's experience. Asus Strix cards are known to be very reliable, and mine has worked perfectly for six weeks now."

I honestly have yet to find anything to complain about(only had it two days). After reading all the other reviews after I had purchased the card, I am feeling pretty apprehensive right now. It isn’t the greatest value for money out there but it does kick some serious ass as far as the performance goes. If this card breaks down on me, I will definitely be calling Asus to have a small conversation about there quality control lately. I hope we can work it out, I really do.

Ok, I have an update. Looks like I won’t have to break up with ASUS. I love this card. Maybe not the best option out there but, when I benchmark this with the modest OC I put on it(+125 core, +600 memory) it matches 1080ti performance. I don’t know about you, but to me, this is eye popping!!! Great work Asus. I stand corrected. Update: I must have hit the silicone lottery, my card rocks although I found it pretty fishy that exactly two week after buying this card, the super line up came out. I really wish someone would have told or warned me that this was going to happen seeing how I spent $200 more for the card, than what it is at now. For the super 2070, I could see spending that much, not for the regular 2070. So, @&$? You Nvidia, I don’t care if you release the next big thing, I’d rather use AMD for now on seeing how they are now a VERY good alternative to your bloated products."

This card ""Asus GeForce RTX 2070 8G GDDR6 Dual-Fan"" is okay (EDIT: NOT okay above $450) from a budget/performance perspective. It is a LARGE 2.5 slot and full length with a very good heat sink and dual fans. This card stays cool and quiet in a (wood) DIY custom case that was built for maximum filtered fresh air flow. It does well for a single 1440P display at moderately high settings in X-Plane 11.35 with General Aviation payware models and little or no add-ons. Working on navigation and IFR/ILS/GPS approach doesn't require perfect scenery, but it does require FPS above 35 without lag so the simulation runs in real time. Remainder of my system is air cooled 4770K@4.3/32G@1666/850EVO/Win10Home64/32""@1440P (nothing special). Models I use for IFR/ILS/GPS is the vanilla 172SP+REP, for taildragger/STOL the VSKYLABS EuroFox A220 Tundra, for light helicopter the VSKYLABS Guimbal Cabri G2, for light twin helicopter the Tim Woods+many others Bell 429 (freeware), and other GA models on occasion for fun. I use iPads to simulate the G1000 PFD and MFD. All that said I have tweaked X-Plane settings so that FPS never goes below 40. It would perform on a level above at 1080P so consider your display and don't buy more than you need.
-- Learning navigation, especially new solo pilots and into new airports or areas, in a simulation is time well spent. The better prepared you are the safer it is for everyone flying.
-- Personal Computer technologies are likely to be on a faster churn over the next few years (2020-2025) so this card will likely be eclipsed very quickly for less money. Hold out as long as you can. Pilot simulation training forced me to upgrade."

After much investigation, I've learned several things:

* Adobe software really prefers NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA cores
* Although Adobe s/w is compatible with several flavors of NVIDIA GPUs, Quadro boards are better for video editing.
* You must ensure that your computer power supply has THE CORRECT POWER CABLE required by the board you select. I originally purchased a GPU that requires an 8-pin power cable, but my Dell Precision T3600 only has 6-pin power cables. You can't convert 6-pin connectors to 8-pin connectors. This K5200 board requires one 6-pin power cable, so it works in my computer.

And, most important, this board works great with Premiere Pro. With my old NVIDIA K2000, Premiere and Media Encoder would occasionally choke on particularly complex video projects. This K5200 happily completes rendering on a complex video project that the K2000 couldn't handle, in a fraction of the time the K2000 would have taken had it not choked on the project."

The video card doesn't take a special 1KWH powersupply, infact I'm running this card with a 600 watt gold and tested that the power draw from the system is way less than that, around 200 watts absolute maximum. This means less heat coming from this card and it still runs a few games with all the new features. The card is standard 2 din and not too long making it a easier fit in the case. The new thing this card has from my previous cards is this one has a metal back plate, no sagging video cards.

About this item

Low Profile Bracket Included

However the low profile bracket was not included despite clearly stating that it was. The amazon customer service rep told me they'd ship another - I asked to verify it has the bracket and they said they would. Here is to hoping.

I cannot review the actual card since I cannot put it in the computer since it did not come as the item detail stated, therefore its automatically a bad review.

Replacement has arrived. Still no low profile bracket. This is false advertising. I bought it because it was the most inexpensive variant I could find that had the low profile bracket that would allow it to fit my computer. Now I have wasted an inordinate amount of time, will have to return two graphics cards and still don't have a solution. This is ridiculous. I wish they could just send me the low profile bracket."

I have to buy it separately and now wait a few days for it to arrive. AND hope it fits well enough since it's from a generic company. Assuming people will use a low profile card like this in a normal sized desktop is a pretty dumb move. As far as the card itself it is probably fine but I won't be able to tell for a few days.

I sadly had to modify the cover bracket on my pc to hold down card as I have a sff desktop. Didn't take any stars, as I am sure that's why it's cheaper than other models, though Amazon should modify the description to reflect this. After installation I have had zero issues. This is entry level card and isn't really geared at gaming but for the games I've tried, which are a few years old, it surpassed my expectations. One day I might upgrade to a 1050 or maybe even a 1650 but for now this has been a great upgrade compared to the onboard integrated videocard."
114.0,PNY GeForce GT 1030 2GB Graphic Cards VCGGT10302PB,PNY,Nvidia,1227 MHz,2,$87.99,4.3 out of 5 stars,Working better then I thought.,"I bought the v5 version for $72, which was a great price, but it didn't include the low profile bracket that was supposed to be included as per the product description. In fact, the sealed PNY box included the video card and not so much as a single sheet of paper with quick install instructions or a driver disk or anything. It literally was a video card in a protective plastic clamshell within the box and there was absolutely nothing else in the box. It isn't worth me sending it back for them to simply send me another with no bracket so I have ordered a low profile bracket from a 3rd party for around $7 that will hopefully fit. This increases the price to $79 which is still around $5 less than the next least expensive gt 1030 that I could find. I definitely find the situation irritating that the description is incorrect.

As for the card itself, I removed the large bracket and went ahead and installed it in my preowned Dell Optiplex 790. It does fit in the small form factor with no issues and will be fully secured once I receive the proper low profile bracket.

The PC I installed this video card on has an old i5-2400 processor and 8gb of ddr3 1333 ram installed. I installed Windows 10 and Tomb Raider (2013) from my Steam library. Prior to installing the video card,
on low settings at 1080p, the Tomb Raider benchmark reported an average FPS of 6. That isn't a typo. The onboard graphics were terrible. After installing the PNY GT 1030 V5, on normal settings at 1080p the benchmark is a rock-solid 60fps. This isn't a powerful gaming card, but it is a fairly economic replacement for onboard graphics on older machines. My primary gaming pc has a gtx 1050ti which is a much better low end gaming option, but for an ultra low budget build it is a competent card for light gaming needs. I tested it for a couple of hours playing the Witcher 3 and it was able to handle the game without any hitching or stutters.

With this card you should be able to play most modern games and have a reasonably good experience, but you won't typically be able to use max settings and you may need to adjust some settings per game in the Nvidia control panel. Make sure you download the Geforce Experience application onto your PC and use it to download and install your driver, since the box doesn't include any software.

For $72 this little card is more capable than I was expecting and it definitely provides a good value for the price. I would rate this at 4 stars if it had included the low profile bracket as per the item description."

I did have some trouble, at first, in installing it. Mainly because my desktop is a custom system and had no embedded graphics chip so, fortunately I was skilled enough to install the card in the PCIe slot (There are usually two of them) and installed the drivers before I installed the new card. After that, pulled the aging card out and presto! This card was a good price (better that all the other main stream suppliers) and it arrived within two days of ordering it. I would recommend this card wither you are buying it as your first card or to replace an existing card in your PC."

With the MSI bolster, the stress on the GPU and the Motherboard is alleviated.

I bought an MSI GTX 1060 6GB GPU here on Amazon when my old GTX 780 Ti crapped out on me. I didn't want to wait to have my 780 Ti fixed and returned to me, so this 1060 was the best I could afford at the time back in February of this year. I never had an issue with GPU sag with my old 780 Ti. I noticed the sag right away with my new GPU. I hated how the sagged looked so after some research, I pulled the trigger on this product and I couldn't be happier. The extendable rod is solid medal and has a little heft to it. It provides all-around protection by protecting the motherboard from being damaged by the weight of graphics card. It has a gas spring design with vertical support between top and bottom of case and it fits cases from 390 mm (height) to 680 mm. It can support 3 graphics cards, as it comes with 3 support lifts. It has an anti-shock rubber base so it absorbs the pressure from gas spring and prevents any damage to the case and it has plastic holders featuring rubber pad in gaming design to buffer vibration and protect the thermal cover.

After a couple of days though, the system started having problems POST'ing. It got worse and worse until the system wouldn't POST at all when the card was installed.

I sent the card back to Gigabyte for warranty service and a week later they said that it wasn't working because I had damaged it. They sent me a picture of a missing capacitor as ""proof"" that I damaged the card, but if you look at the solder pads, it's obvious that nothing was ever attached there (and there's no other scratches or blemishes, as would happen if I had mishandled the card).

They sent me back the non-working card, they have invalidated my warranty, and they won't respond to my emails.

I'm outside of the return window, so I'm left with a piece of junk.

I will never buy another Gigabyte product and I recommend that you look for another brand as well."

I am a few years behind in games, but i noticed better graphics and gameplay on Call of Duty: Ghosts with maxed out setting. My next game will be Call of Duty: Black Ops II.

Minus 1 star: Only issue i had was when i installed the card and used the CD installation CD, by screen resolution was at 800 x 600. Then i kept getting blue-screen. Apparently the software on the CD is only for adjusting the card itself and the color logo. There was no NVIDIA driver on the installation CD-ROM.

The card has a modest Gigabyte RGB logo on the top, which you can customize using Gigabyte's Aorus utility. The card runs super cool at 37-40° C at idle and ~67° C while playing games.

I'm running the GPU at stock speeds and still getting decent frame rates even with my aging CPU. Playing at 1080p resolution with maxed out settings, I'm averaging 120fps in Battlefront 2 campaign, Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark @ 105fps, ~115fps in Battlefield I campaign. Once I get a 1440p high refresh monitor I will see how this card does at that resolution.

I installed the free copy of Battlefield 5 I got with this card from Amazon (Nvidia promo that goes through January 2019), which I have not played yet.

Side note - the product page on Amazon does not indicate you get the free BFV, at the last page of the check out process there's a message confirming the promo.

The card is super easy to overclock using the Aorus utility or EVGA's Precision X1 software. You can max out the card's power to 114% and reach boost clock around 1750MHz, up from the stock 1620MHz. The utility software has a built-in Nvidia Scanner feature that tells you the card's limits without having to put up with the frustration of trial and error. The scanning process takes a while, it took about 20 minutes for me. You can use this information to play around with GPU clock and voltage settings within the safe parameters.

I'm going to run the card stock for a few weeks to see if it's a lemon, as many of the reviwers have experienced. On the surface there appears to be unusually high number of defective cards with the RTX 20 series cards.

I will update with a bit longer-term report in a few weeks' time.

Update (1/2/2019): The card is still performing as expected without any issues. It is able to run Battlefield 5 at mixed settings (tweaked according to good visuals/good fps performance balance) with >100 fps while the game still looks beautiful. I used graphical settings guideline for BF5 from a couple of youtube channels. Performance wise the load temperatures are still very low at 50° - 69°. The noise from the fans is barely noticeable even while playing.

A solid video card, albeit at a premium price. However, if you are like me going from GTX 680 and upgrading after five years, the price is more or less justified. It was a good purchase for me."

This card does everything I expected it to do and more. It crushes every game I throw at it with 100 FPS or higher. The only thing I can say is be wary on purchasing this. The RTX 2060 is coming out on 01/15/2019 and it might be worth checking out being that it'll be $350 starting. The 2070 is fantastic, but it isn't worth the extra $150 that the 2060 will be going for."

This all at stock, no OC of anything... yet. The slight drop in clarity from 1440 to 1080 is worth the realism of RTX. RTX has finally arrived, and it is gorgeous.

Despite those reviews, I went ahead and purchased. I received mine last week and got it installed. I replaced two Nvidia 970 GTX cards in SLI. Right out of the box I could tell this is a well made card. It has 3 fans and an metal backing plate for protection. It fits in a PCI-e slot. It also takes advantage of x16 PCI-e which is good. I'm using dual monitors. I hooked up my 1440p and 4K monitors,booted my system. POSTed fine with no issues. The GeForce experience Nvidia drivers updated and I was in business. Loaded up Division 2 using my 1440p monitor on Ultra settings. The game looks and plays amazing. Note, if you play Division 2, you know it doesn't support SLI, hence my decision to purchase this card. Other notable things I'd like to mention is my motherboard, CPU, and Ram are 4 year old tech. The 2070 worked flawlessly in my 4 year old system and was definitely a major upgrade in performance. The card is not loud at all, barely here it when I'm playing Division 2. Not sure why other people are having problems with is card.
I would make sure the card is seated properly, has the correct power cables connected, and you have at least a 550W PSU. My system's PSU is 550W and I have not encountered any issues."

I'm playing games such as Squad, Scum, Assassins Creed Syndicate/Origins, and Star Wars battlefront 2 on the highest settings and getting around 70-120 fps except during heavily rendered scenarios like large views of the horizon or multiple smoke grenades on the ground. I've had no problems with the card, and seeing some of the reviews for it, I hope it stays this way and would definitely recommend it as an upgrade if you dont wanna cough up an extra $200-$500 for a 1080ti or 2080.

This card (and the previous card) were tested on multiple machines, with the same result, more or less.

After using these I had experienced issues and tested everything else, I was at my wits end and was about to RMA my MOBO when I though you know what it might be these crappy bridges (there were all those bad reviews on them). So I ordered a stock used bridge from another website and paid overnight delivery for it, and as soon as I put it in my system Boom all issues resolved and everything working as it should.

Physical: I will say that unlike pictures in other reviews all the wires in these bridges are connected and soldered correctly the only thing off physically is that they both had the small band with the words ""link up"" on it backward so they were not viewable with them installed, but that is just visual so i don't care.

Performance: I tested every possible configuration of the bridges and things were fine on the Desktop however if you launched any 3d application, there was extreme artifacting, glitching, and then the application would crash. Only resolution was to disable SLI until my replacement used bridge (as mentioned above) came in.

I've played about 3 hours of DOOM tonight with ultra settings at 3160p and have averaged 35-40 fps. Afterburner shows the temp never getting above 80c, and the fan maxed at 75%. This is the 4GB version.

PROS:
* Plays games at 4k when most say it won't.
* For less intensive games the fan doesn't even need to be on.
* Quality construction, doesn't feel flimsy at all.
* Worked out of the box. Plugged it in, updated my drivers all was good.
* Doom with Vulkan API is blazing fast.
* Every game I have installed looks incredible at 4k.
* At 1080p I see fps from 70+ easy.

CONS:
* Fan is a little noisy (I have my PC in the family room and although they noted it was a little loud, it didn't bother anyone).

I can't say enough how impressed I am. I had all kinds of worries prior to receiving it due to some bad reviews. I was very worried about the temperature, and noise. Some reviews said it crashed there machines. I've seen none of that. I don't know if this is an issue with overclocking but I see no reason to mess with that, it is incredible as it is.

Wow, what a difference this card makes! And with no other changes to my rig. GTA V went from an unplayable online 20 FPS to over 60 FPS (maxing out my monitor's abilities). Several other games I've tested so far are all doing over 60 FPS with Ultra settings. This card definitely sprung new life into what was a high-end gaming machine 5 years ago.

One thing to keep in mind when choosing between this card and the very equal GTX 1060, is that the GTX 1060 doesn't support Crossfire/SLI. (You have to spend about $200 more to get the GTX 1070 to support it.) So this is what finalized my decision. Not only is the RX 480 cheaper, but it will be even cheaper in a year or so to add another card to Crossfire it.

Another thing to keep in mind is the specs of your monitor. If it maxes out at 60Hz at 1080p, buying a faster, and much more expensive card, like a GTX 1070 or 1080, isn't going to show you noticable difference in most games, because your screen will already be maxed out. So, no reason to spend double or triple on something that you won't notice the difference on.

If you're looking for a semi-budget friendly card with plenty of power this card is a good choice. I understand opinions vary greatly on all things computer, however the RX 480 is dollar for dollar a better value compared to many of the GTX cards. Are there better? Absolutely! Both AMD and Nvidia have better offerings, but the price jumps start to look like Al Gore's ""hockey stick"" chart. Since this was part of a new build, everything went like clockwork. If you have an older computer, double check your rig to see if it can handle not only the slot on the motherboard, but the additional power from the power supply and length of card. I would purchase the card again and would suggest it to others if it matched their needs.

The latest Windows 10 update sabotaged my AMD drivers and caused my RX480 to give blank screens, once brown, once white and once black. I had to force my PC to use the integrated graphics while I uninstalled all RX480 drivers and then re-installed them. So far everything is going well.

Microsoft supposedly made an announcement in 2017 that this sort of thing will start to happen. This is disgusting tactics to get people to buy INTEL based products. Personally, I will buy more AMD or anything that is not owned by Microsoft.

Original:
I have had this card since 2016. I paid $240 for it which was actually a lot at the time since the Crypto world hadn't ruined card prices yet.
I loved this card while it lasted.
I don't put this card through too much and keep it very well cooled. I play League of Legends and PUBG and other than that I do homework on my desktop. The card died tonight while I was just about to save my homework to a document.

I expect more from any card than 2 years. Usually when I buy a mid-range card I assume it will get me through my games for a minimum of 4 years and possibly up to 6 years. This one died after just 2 years of use. I expect more from MSI. Now I am unable to buy a card due to the inflated prices and will be stuck using my integrated graphics."

I was recently in a huge battle on what to get, either this or the GTX 1060. I got this card kind of on sale from another retailer for $280. I will be updating this review when I have had more time with the card and have a better idea.

This card so far is fantastic. Looks good, the LEDs are nice (doesn't get as dark red as I would prefer with my black / red build, but no biggy). The MSI Software is a little over the top to start with, but it doesn't take long to figure out. It was super simple to install, then I just searched AMD rx 480 drivers and downloaded the newest ones online, and it worked right after a reboot. This card got to around 76 C in my case while doing a stress test, but it was still fairly quiet considering the fans were working pretty good.

All the games I have ran so far look amazing, (this is my first PC build) so everything looks super smooth. I plan on getting a free-sync monitor and will have more to say then.

If you can manage to pick up this card sub $300 (this is around launch of the RX 480...) do it. Very nice. No regrets, simple to install, and great quality.

The card died after 5 months of decent use."

I at first was a bit concern about buying from MSI Gaming, but i do not regret it. It my first time buying from them, and it won't be the last. The video card came to me all taken care of and was super easy to install. On a plus, it very very small and compact. I was kind of wondering is it really going to handle any games i play. Well it can but do understand this isn't a top dog kind of video card,

It still can handle all games, but depending on which though and the settings you choose. but besides that. I can say for certain that you won't regret this video card. I had to replace my older nivida GTX 460 SC 1GB card that it wasn't a bad card it lasted for almost 10 years. But, it was on it moments of last breath, and it just choose to stop.

So if you need a bang for your buck card, this will be a great start on a low budget."

I see a lot of 1 star reviews saying not to buy this card, and that MSI makes garbage cards, etc. This made me curious, since I bought my MSI Rx 480 in September 2016 and have had exactly zero problems with it. It has been punished with 8-hour BF1, Elite Dangerous, and ESO sessions, been left on for days or weeks at a time, and I've literally had none of the issues others are reporting. This led me to check reviews on numerous cards, including Asus, EVGA, Gigabyte, and Zotac Rx 480s and GTX 1070s. Without fail, anywhere between 6%-29% of reviews are 1 star complaints about DOA cards, frequent lockups, BSODs, excessive heat/load, frame drops, and horrible customer service. It seems quality control for all the major manufacturers is lacking, so basically it's a lottery no matter who you buy from. Based on my experience alone, I can say that this card has handled everything I've thrown at it with no issues. Would buy again.

This card is comparable to NVidia's GTX 1060 6GB offering. If you don't plan on running crossfire eventually (which I plan on doing) get the 4gb RX480 card. By the time games require 8GB of VRAM this card won't be graphically powerful enough to handle them performance wise. Get this 8GB card if you plan on running crossfire now or later (pair with another 8GB RX480) then you may have enough graphical horsepower to handle future games that require 8GB of VRAM. Two of these in crossfire has better performance then a GTX 1070 which costs around FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS, and is right on the heals of the GTX 1080 which costs around SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. AMD's RADEON drivers have improved quite impressively over the years. More and more games take advantage of SLI and Crossfire and considering this card is cheaper then a GTX 1060, the 1060 isn't SLI compatible, and this RX 480 has 2 GB more of VRAM I think this card is the bargain. Keep in mind the cost reflects no backplate on the card or RGB lighting. If you want that go for the MSI Gaming X edition or the Asus STRIX cards, as well as other brands. Great card, no problems so far. I have this in a Corsair Carbide 500R case, running a Intel Core i5 6600K @ 4.5ghz, on a MSI Z170A KRAIT Gaming motherboard, 16 GB of G.Skill DDR4 3200mhz RAM, Corsair H100i cooling, Samsung 500 GB 850 EVO SSD, Soundblaster ZX Sound card, Seagate 2TB storage drive, & EVGA G3 850 power supply.

Why didn't I buy Nvidia instead? Overall, this card is in a kind of perfect spot. For the money, you aren't likely to get better performance and efficiency. If you never liked the idea of spending over $600 on a video card, AMD and Radeon have always been there for us.

I'm running this with a Ryzen 1800X, 32GB of 3200 DDR4, and an M2 drive. I don't play a lot of the brand new DX12 games, but this thing will play Arma 3 with every single setting maxed (except view distance), at full 4k resolution, and consistently hover above 30 FPS.

The board and cooler seem well-designed, and it's not as heavy as some other cards in this class. With that said, like many others, I feel that a backplate would have helped its cooling. For the price, however, I think you get a great powerhouse of a card that (literally) won't weigh down your motherboard. If you are looking for a good steal in bang for your buck, I would watch prices on this card as we get closer to the release of the Radeon 500s and Vega."

- Plays most games at Ultra/High at 1080p/60FPS
- Easy and high overclocking capability
- Near reference RX 480 performance and sometimes better on a slight OC
- Holds boost clocks stable and constant under load
- 8-pin connector and good power delivery
- Awesome performance in DX12/Vulkan games
- Awesome design and LEDs

Cons: - Stock factory clocks on core/memory (even in OC mode) could be higher
- Card is really big and barely fits in my Silverstone case
- Card is overpriced by about $10-20.
- No backplate for some reason (even though MSI RX 480 Gaming X version does)

Other Thoughts: - 8GB is more future proof but most people gaming at 1080p won't notice a big performance difference so while I fully recommend this product, you can save yourself some money if you're on a budget and get the 4GB.
- Two of these in CF should be impressive
- Even with 4 less compute units than the RX 480, the power and efficiency of these chips is impressive
- At this price point ($240, same as reference RX 480) you have to wonder which sector this product is aimed at.
- If you got the extra money, spring the $50 or so and get the RX 480 version, but this card is more than enough power at 1080p/60FPS for your gaming needs (especially with more DX12 titles coming out)

- Overall very happy with my purchase and the performance of this card. Stays cool (66° C) under load in my HTPC case and can barely hear fans even at full speed (2400RPM). OCs to give extra performance when I need it and only raises temps a few degrees. Got tired of waiting for the AIB RX 480s to come in stock and didn't want to spend around $300 for what's supposed to be a budget gaming card. I felt like I had settled with the reference RX 480, but this bad boy hasn't let me down! (This is the end of the main part of the product review. Below is a pricing/buying recommendation guide.)

Pricing/Purchasing Decisions: There has been a lot of misinformation, marketing and just fanboy-ism this generation of GPUs for some reason. That along with some of the statements made in other reviews I wanted to address pricing for the RX 470, compared to the RX 480, and help you in making an informed decision, not only in whether to purchase this product but maybe lead you to another product that's right for you, if not this one. First, I've read at least a couple reviews here (for the 4GB version, I believe) stating they got this product on a certain site for a certain price (around $168) and if you pay more than that, this card is overpriced or the seller is a scalper. If you got the card for that price, good for you, buddy, but that doesn't mean that's the price the card is meant to be at. The MSRP stated by AMD for the RX 470 4GB is starting at $179, which is for the models with reference specifications (although there is no reference model, there are models with reference coolers and PCBs). The running retail price for the AIB 4GB models with custom coolers is around $199, which is still an amazing value for the performance you get. I don't recommend spending too much more than that (although the Sapphire RX 470 NITRO+ is running around $209 and XFX has a model that runs around $219 at Best Buy), but when you look at the performance of the RX 470 compared to other products (to include the Nvidia GTX 960 and 3GB GTX 1060) around the $179-199 price range it's an amazing value. The running retail price for the 8GB variant of the RX 470 (for the manufacturers who make them: MSI and Sapphire) is $239. There the value proposition does go down for the increase, if any, in performance you see over the 4GB versions. So who is this product (MSI RX 470 Gaming X 8G and other 8GB variants) for? If you want to game at 1080P 60FPS at Ultra/High details in DX11, DX12 and Vulkan games and want to be able to play at maxed out video textures (and need Nightmare Video Textures in Doom 2016) with cool temps and quiet fans and an out of the box (OOTB), plug n play (PNP) experience get this product now. If you want the same experience, but don't mind tuning down the video textures a notch in some games (Doom 2016, RoTR and Assassin's Creed Unity), get the MSI RX 470 Gaming X 4G. You will see a negligible difference in performance over the 8GB model at $199 ($40 cheaper). If you want a little higher performance but have the cooling/airflow headroom to run cards that run a little warmer, get the Sapphire NITRO+ ($10 more) or Powercolor Red Devil (higher base boost clock) RX 470 4GB at the same price point. If you want to game at 1440p (at Medium/High settings) or are interested in playing in VR and have a larger tower build with good airflow/cooling and gaming on a budget of $250 or below and want a GPU that will last you 2+ years, get the reference RX 480. It runs warm and a little loud, but it can handle it. If you can spring the extra $50-60 and want a little more performance in a card that will last you 2-3 years, a great out of the box experience, cooler temps and quieter fan noise, get the MSI RX 480 Gaming X 8G or 4G or ASUS Strix RX 480. If you want the highest performance, but have the cooling/ventilation headroom to run at warmer temps and don't mind a little more fan noise, get the XFX or Sapphire NITRO+ RX 480 variant. Finally, if you mostly play DX11 games and don't really care about any current or future DX12/Vulkan games (BF1, Deus Ex MD, Gears of War UE and 4, Forza Horizon 3, Doom 2016, AoTS, Hitman 2016, Total War: WH, Civilization VI, etc.), care about cool temps and power efficiency, only use single-GPU solutions (not SLI/CF) and usually replace your video card every 1-2 years get the Nvidia GTX 1060 6GB (starting at $249-300+). It handles DX11 games very capably at the 1080p resolution at High/Ultra settings (can't recommend the 3GB GTX 1060 at any price point, I'm sorry but the small amount of VRAM, even with Nvidia's efficiency at handling memory, will become a limitation if not already). You may think it's strange that in an AMD RX 470 review and comparison that I'm recommending an Nvidia product, but having come from Nvidia the past 3 generations, even I can admit it's impressive what they've done with the improvements in power/thermal efficiency in Pascall. I have my own reasons for not going with Nvidia this generation, even though the GTX 1060 is overall a better performer in DX11 at cooler temps, the RX 470/480 pull far ahead in DX12/Vulkan and I want the ability to eventually be able to CF/SLI, whether I end up using that capability or not. I hope this info and recommendations help you in making your purchasing decision. At the end of the day, I'm very happy with this product, even with the performance difference between this and the reference RX 480 at the same price, as it's out of the box settings ""just work"" great but has the headroom for tweaks and performance improvements through OCing/undervolting and does so at cool temperatures and quiet fan noise levels. Happy Gaming!"

I cannot even explain how happy I am to have this in my hands.
BEST RX 480 EVER!!!!!
Best Cooling, Best performance!, Crossfire!!!!!, VR Ready!, and so much more that I cannot even explain.

I can recommend this card to even a professional.
I was once a Nividia fan and a fan of EVGA, ASUS, Gigabyte, and all of those other ones. But until I got my hands on the MSI RX 480 GAMING X 8G, I knew it was destiny!

Also, let it be known that I play all of these, and many others, on a 24"",1080p / 60hz monitor. I cannot comment on any other resolution / refresh rate other than this one, but I easily play on Ultra / nightmare / mega-max settings with no problems whatsoever.

1. It's a refurb - no box, no cables, no disc's, nothing... but also, no dust on the card, and not a mark... if you saw it in my computer now you'd think I bought it retail yesterday. Also ran benchmarks and a 90 minute stress test, card got up to 80 degrees, but ZERO errors, and no artifacts. Oh and its 3-6 times FASTER than my 1060 was.
2. Card has been out 3 years and it's still expensive - I replaced a GTX 1060 3Gb which could run Doom Eternal in 1080p on low settings only, this beast runs it on 4k Ultra Nightmare settings and its WELL above 60FPS, it's beautiful to rip and tear in full quality and I can finally fully utilize my monitor... it was still an expensive card, but as long as it doesn't ignite or melt I will be using it happily for years.

2.Card is indistinguishable from a new one yes it looks that new.
3. No the card does not come with any accessories but that's no big deal.

5 I upgraded from a Gtx 980 Msi gaming X. On Red Dead 2 On 1080p with mostly medium settings I used to get 27 to 35 fps with that 980 now with the 1080ti I'm getting on ultra settings @ 1440p I'm getting almost 60 steady.

It is power-hungry, so have at least a 650W PSU if you run one and a 1KW hummer if you do like I did (see below).

I've been wanting to set up an SLI system ever since Nvidia first introduced it, but couldn't afford to. Times have changed and I went looking on different sites for the right pair of cards to put into my brand-new self-built PC (specs below). After much searching, I came upon this GPU. The price for two, however, was still out of my range.

Then I came here. I saw there were two refurbed units listed @ $700 each. I read every review and knew I had to have them. I'm sorry to say those were the last two at that price. The only one left here right now is listed at $1500. OUCH!

I bought a fancy MSI SLI bridge to really dress this up, but my mobo's (MSI Z490 ACE) distance between the first and third PCIe slots creates a 100 mm reach between cards and the fancy bridges are all 80 mm. :-( I went with a simple wire tape bridge. Oh well... Make sure you measure the distance between those slots on your mobo if you plan on doing a dual-card setup to keep you from making the same mistake I did. BTW, you don't need a bridge - some mobos will link them directly - but you lose some speed that way.

I'm currently playing Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4. (I got distracted by a different hobby while these came out and I barely played them before looking away.) I'm running @ 4K and I can crank up *every* setting on these to Ultra with every bell and whistle set to 11. I replaced an MSI Nvidia 2080 Armor GPU with these and the differences are quite noticeable. Several sections of Fallout 4 ran like a slide show with things cranked up to max (if not crashing to the desktop!) but now there're zero problems. The details are incredible. Fallout New Vegas is older but it's still much, much, MUCH better with this system.

I would definitely wait for a different seller to pop-up here and getting an actual deal before buying one of these, but don't be late! These cards fly off the shelf when they're priced reasonably.

I received it at 5pm, had it installed, software loaded and dialed in by 7pm. I have an older (2006) Sony VAIO desk top that I have started upgrading. It is currently running Windows XP and the card easily excedes the capability of XP. My primary intent for the card was the capability to run dual digital moniters and it is doing a great job. I have a SyncMaster P2770FH on HDMI and a SyncMaster 204B on DVI. Using the Extended Desktop mode with different settings and resolutions on each moniter, and both are looking good. Very smooth transitions between monitors. The windows automatically convert to the new screen as you drag them over. What a great way to work, browse or relax. I have Windows 7 on order and expect more great performance when I get that loaded and running. Will post an update when completed, but may take a little time because SONY no longer supports this OMG 5 year old dinosaur. Fortunately the component manufacturers do provide support. Will have to keep that in mind the next time I buy a new system.

06/01/11 = I have completed the 64 bit Windows 7 conversion and this card is performing beyond expectations. I am running both moniters at MAX resolution without a hint of a problem. I added a 2T hard drive, dual tuner TV receiver and 7.1 sound card, and the power consumption and heat disipation are well within my systems' original capability. If you want a plug-in Windows 7 compatible ""silent"" (no fan required) video card for above average (great TV and movies, but not extensive 3D applications) performance, buy this card before they are all gone at this great price.

01/03/13 = I scrapped the Sony VAIO and built a new AMD FX system and installed xfire video cards, so I gave this video card to my stepdad for his new AMD FX system. It is still performing flawlessly with dual Samsung Hi-Res Digital monitors. If they are still available, I can't imagine a better value for most applications. Intense graphics applications will cost extra (some are a lot extra), but for most MS Office applications, the usual web applications and even cable TV, this card is a great value."

The card needed to be not only half height capable but also be thin for side clearance. It also had to run with a sub 300 Watt power supply.
HDMI port needed as well, as the PC is setup for use with my Plasma TV.
This card fit the bill on all fronts.

It brings the Average G3D Mark Video up to a 244 from the built in GMA 3000's almost nil score.

It included all necessary brackets to convert to half-height.

The drivers that came with the card on CD were a bit outdated so I've downloaded the latest rather than install the disk.

Image is better now on the TV via HDMI and Streaming video seems very smooth.

No complaints so far."

Drivers loaded quickly and appears to be working without any issues. The computer is used for static type graphics so there was no need for game use. Profile of the card is very slim and fit an older HP board with no issues. The only hiccup was with the audio. Since this card has an HDMI port the computer automatically recognized it and switched to HDMI audio output. Since the audio is through speakers embedded in the monitor (like I said we are not gamers) there was no audio. In fact the computer would not even display an additional audio option. Luckily there are computer experts out there who post solutions on the internet. I carefully followed directions and entered the BIOS field and was able to amend the audio field from auto select to enable. The computer then displayed all audio options, to include selecting the speakers on the monitor and even the externals plugged into the audio jack (green). Computer and video card are working just fine. Well worth the minimal investment to upgrade your onboard/embedded graphics card. FYI, entering BIOS with Windows 10 was relatively easy."

He said to get a computer with a faster processor and video card, 16 Gigs of RAM, and run with 64 Bit Bites in Widows 7.

He is right, but I don't have that kind of money right now. But right now, with a 2.8 Mhz Microprocessor, a 32 Bit O/S (Vista), on 3 Gigs of RAM, AND THIS VIDEO CARD, I'm sufficiently satisfied with my computer. For now, that is. The, ASUS HD5450 doesn't solve all my computer problems. It displays my RAW pictures quicker than before, but still not quick enough for me. While I won't be buying another computer just now, I am getting a ViewSonic VX2453 MH monitor. I need this to view truer colors before making photographic prints. This is important, but only for artists, photographers, and techno-nerds. (I'm a little bit of each.) The ViewsSonic monitor does have other qualities that most people would appreciate. I'm also bringing my RAM memory up to 6GB. This is all I can afford to do for the next two years.

I should mention that the ASUS card was very easy to install. I just took out the old card, put in the ASUS card, and auto-ran the program supplied on disk. I didn't read any Guide Book or instruction manual. I'll check that out later. Today I'm finished. I updated my O/S after the driver was installed, and I checked that the card was working properly. All this is easy stuff.

UPDATE 01/18/12
Had the time to update the driver today. I don't actually see any difference. Anyway, the RAM modules are on order. We will see if that will improve video speed.

UPDATE 1-20-2012

Today the two 2GB memory modules arrived and I installed them in my computer. That did it! I no longer have to wait watching Canon RAW images as they take their time coming into focus. My picture editing time is cut in half.

I don't know if I had not first installed the Graphics card if I would achieve the same result with only extra memory. I've worn myself out getting my computer to behave at top speed. For this reason I am not sorting out the steps that have lead me to satisfaction. I'm recommending that people do both if they are having problems with slow video, photographs, other graphics, or for gaming. Doing both costs only around $80.00. And it puts you almost a full computer generation ahead."
127.0,ASUS AMD Radeon HD 5450 SILENT Series with 0dB Thermal Solution and 1 GB Memory Video Card EAH5450 SILENT/DI/1GD3(LP),Dell Computers,Nvidia,1890 MHz,24 GB,$175.00,4.1 out of 5 stars,FASTER THAN THE VIDEO CARD THAT CAME WITH MY COMPUTER,"I purchased this card to make an HTPC out of an old Acer X1200. The onboard graphics on the x1200 were not quite up to the task of playing recorded 1080p content with Windows Media Center (WMC), which is my HTPC tool of choice on Windows 7. I had some constraints to work with.

1) The X1200 is a small-format micro-ATX case, which means I needed a low-profile (narrow) card.
2) The one PCI Express x16 slot is at the extreme top of the case, meaning there is very little clearance between the top of the case and the slot (about an inch).
3) I didn't want a card with a fan, because it's intended for an HTPC and needs to be quiet.
4) The X1200 has a 220V power supply, so the card needs to consume relatively low power.
5) I got this computer for free and didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on it, so the card needed to be cheap.

This card meets all my needs, and plays 1080p content smoothly via WMC. A couple of observations:

1) The card does get warm as it has no fan, and because of the slot location the card is jammed up against the top of the case with perhaps a quarter-inch of clearance. The top of the case feels warm to the touch after an hour of 1080p playback, and some passive warm air can be felt coming from the vents near the top of the case. The case and the air are warm, but not hot, and I do not think this will be a problem over time. To be cautious, I am choosing to let the computer go to sleep when not in use both to keep energy usage low and to avoid heat buildup over time.

2) Some of the default settings in the Catalyst Control Center software application which comes with the card appear to conflict with WMC, causing jerky playback. Through trial-and-error, I found and turned off the settings which were causing the conflict and now playback is smooth. On the ""other video settings"" page in the Catalyst application (Video--> Video Quality--> Other Video Settings), I turned everything off except for ""enforce smooth video playback"".

3) While the picture of the included low-profile bracket appears to show a single double-height bracket for DVI, HDMI and VGA, in reality there were two separate brackets in the package I received - one for DVI+HDMI, and one for VGA. This was a huge relief, as in my application the VGA port needs to be below the other two, and I would have needed to cut a single-piece bracket in half in order to achieve this. I read elsewhere that some packages come with a single two-slot bracket and some come with two separate brackets, so I think I got lucky in this regard.

4) This card is listed as a PCI Express V2.1 card, and the PCI Express x16 slot in the X1200 is a v2.0 slot. While I read elsewhere that people had trouble with this card in a v1.0 slot, it is working just fine in my v2.0 slot.

I read a whole bunch about a whole lot of low-cost cards for HTPC use, and ended up crossing my fingers and trying this one. I wasn't sure if it would fit (hard to find the dimensions), I wasn't sure it would work in my PCI Express slot, I wasn't sure if heat would be a problem and I wasn't sure it would perform better than the onboard graphics on the x1200. I am pleasantly surprised on all fronts. 5 stars for being what it is given the use I have for it."

Love it,"The card runs okay for easy tasks such as web surfing and Microsoft Office utilization. I tried to play what I thought was a graphically undemanding game (Crusader Kings II) and it immediately produced a significant amount of artifacts that required rebooting. I believe the heat sink design is the issue. Its not attached very well. I may try removing the heatsink and lapping the contact area to see if I can flatten out the contact surface and applying some thermal paste to see if that removes the artifacts. I am not optimistic it will solve the problem but its worth a shot before having to buy another video card. I feel like I shouldn't have to do this as a consumer but I don't want to have to buy another card if I can help it.

I pulled this card out of my system and put the old video card back in which is a 9400GT 512M PCI interface (the old PCI interface, not the PCIe) which does not produce any graphical artifacts but is the bottleneck in my system's performance."

The Installer comes with a bunch of additional software which is useless.
After installation, my computer started freezing/crashing/showing blue screen of death upon startup. Sometimes I would be able to load the system fully but it would freeze about ten minutes after and I'd be forced to open safe mode to uninstall/reinstall the card.

Some caveats:
(1) if you are looking for applications that only require single-precision (ex. many machine learning applications), other more modern GeForce GPUs are a better use of your money.
(2) this is a GPU compute unit, not a graphics card, so you cannot drive a monitor with this.
(3) this does not come with a fan. However many that are compatible with the K80 can be found on eBay for around $20

It is just as expected, the performance approaches the score of K40. (I suppose the K80 is just, roughly speaking, two K40s integrated together).

One inconvenience for PC users is that you need to put some really-really powerful fans to force the air flow.

Another small hinder is that the GPU memory chip one the back side has no metal back-plate or heat sinks attached to it, when running the bench, they become really hot. Unless you actually put it in a server or a case with server-level air flow design, I might try to put some heat sinks on them for PC usage.

Lots of Image data. I have ONE Tesla K80, need 4-7. This item makes my work a lot simpler. Only drawback is that to use the tools with it you need an external graphics card like the Quadro K-architecture cards so you can monitor it. Wound up adding memory to the system too. Some servers don't come wired for the extra power connections and cooling. What I wound up doing was installing a PCIe Expansion rack from One Stop systems to solve the power and cooling issue. Computer room is a bit noisy though. All together I am happy with it now that we got all the other things worked out that weren't obvious. Make sure your machine's BIOS support PCIe Expansion Config memory. Some Desktop motherboards do not and I learned the hard way. Yes I am familiar with PCIe Driver design. Had previous experience with Linux and PCIe device drivers."

My biggest gripe with the water block so far is it is branded as an RTX2080 card now. The block is compatible with several GPUs, and I think EVGA would have been just fine leaving the series number off the block, but that is just me. The process took about an hour to remove the air cooler and install the water block. The most tedious part of the whole thing was getting that dang LED connector plugged in, because it is about -1 inch long. Yes, -1 inch. It breaks the rules of the known universe, and if you have fat sausage fingers like me you will struggle.

After installation it was fairly straight forward. I had other components to install at the same time (PC transitioned to a full loop) and the card has several options for routing the fittings. No fittings are included with this block, so make sure you have some before hand. It does have several plugs that can be moved around to fit routing needs. Make sure to tighten them even if you don't move them, mine were all finger tight. If I had to gander, I would say that these plugs will be the first source of failure, as mine were magnetic indicating a dissimilar metals situation can occur. A good quality coolant additive may help, time will tell.

My biggest complaint and it can be seen in the photos is it appears that my card now has a sizable bend near the power connectors. I don't think its sag, however I could be wrong. I didn't notice it during installation and maybe its my imagination but it just doesn't look right.

I'm hoping to get some life out of this block, even if the 30 series are coming out. Best case scenario is the system gets handed off to one of my goblins and I will build a new one which will probably include another EVGA waterblock."

Mine arrived in perfect condition with no internal flaws like bent fins or cracked acrylic anywhere.

I bought an EVGA 2080 Super Hybrid a few months back and what I thought was pump whine was actually a broken impeller (no idea how that even happens when they're plastic and pre-molded). I was planning to convert to a full custom loop anyways, so went ahead and purchased the Hydro Copper block so that it would be a seamless transition.

All RGB lighting works perfectly and REALLY illuminates the block. Assembly is super easy and very well instructed. The block is pretty heavy before adding it to the card, so be careful not to drop it as THAT would probably cause some damage."

I got an EK block but something was wrong with it so I RMA’d it and in the process of waiting for the new block, I found this. I was like oh hell ya! And ordered it. I already had my card disassembled so once this block hit my porch it was installed inside of 20 minutes, and so far I love it and had to jump on here for a review real quick. I love the fact that I now have access to the RGB and Fan header on the back of the card, the EK block covered them up (not cool EK). As stated the EK block was bad, GPU temps were in low to mid 80’s under stress test, and yes I tried ev3rything under the sun to determine why, I came to the conclusion of bad machining on the GPU pad of the block or something pertaining to that pad (I am not 100% sure, but as a machinist by trade, this is my conclusion). I have yet to install and test yet, I am still waiting on the CPU block, that’s another story because I am sending back the EK motherboard mono block as well.

My EVGA 1080 Ti SC2 was NOT as cool as this card. That EVGA 1080 Ti ran up to 78C on full load. The Asus Strix 2080 OC runs max 56C on full load during battlefield on DXR on and ultra settings while still getting 60 FPS or above for most of the time except for when the scene gets too crazy or if you're zooming in on aiming then it drops to 50s to high 40s in FPS, but with my gsync monitor, still smooth as butter. This card is a must for people who want RTX and future DLSS with 3440x1440p ultrawide monitor. I got the AW3418DW monitor from best buy for $700 and ITS AMAZING. Holy crap, much better than my 1080 Ti and Vega 64. I feel much more smooth and immersed and life like when playing with the 2080 compared to 1080 Ti and obviously the Vega 64. Now vega 64 runs well on my freesync monitor on my all AMD rig, but this card BLOWs it out of the water with gsync. I thought gsync was a total waste of money but I was wrong with this card. Absolutely worth it if you got a gsync monitor and still good even if you dont have gsync. This card runs SUPER cool and I kid you not, idle is 28C?! Wait what? Full load during BF5 maxes out at 57C? I have no idea how they make this card so cool but it works. This card has NO coil whine and NO artifacts. I think I got lucky with the silicon lottery issue with other users. This card is SUPER QUIET. I sent back my Vega 64 as if was loud AF, hot, and hot and black screens a lot despite using amd radeon latest software as of 10 Jan 2018 with lowering the voltage via wattman and trying attaching two separate 8-pin cables. I said screw it and just stick with Nvidia despite having a freesync monitor on my other rig and so far so good since the monitor acts like a normal monitor. This card is EXPENSIVE. I would give it 5 stars if the price was lower.

Now I'm interested in comparing this card to future Navi releases which I'll buy and test out. But if you need a GPU, this card is worth it for those who dont care about 4k gaming and aint doing any other serous GPU intensive work. This card is ""good enough"" or more than enough I must say. If you play games smoothly, the numbers dont matter much to you. Dont get too focused on the FPS numbers unless it makes the gaming experience unplayable. So far, I'm a HAPPY CUSTOMER."

It was quiet and fast for all my needs playing at 1440P. Always have bought EVGA for as long as I can remember. My wife bought me an ASUS PG279Q monitor for Christmas and I felt the urge to upgrade my video card to utilize the 144HZ refresh rate in my games. I play Tomb Raider, Metro, Doom 3 and Wolfenstein II.
2080 cards were out and I was searching for the best looking card since I have a S340 and like to look at my hardware and have it look nice, especially when you're spending this much money ($800+).
I settled initially on the MSI Duke 2080TI and loved the look, it was quiet, it was fast but man did it have coil whine. I am sensitive to sound, my system is virtually quiet with all the NZXT fans and Kraken X62 and my 1080 FTW2 was super quiet and looked oh so good, absolutely loved that card. Moving on...I couldn't handle the coil whine, I did all the burn in tests that everyone suggested, changed power supply (I had a Corsair RM850 and changed it to a RM850I). Unfortunately none of that worked, I actually think these people on message boards and forums have no clue and just like to write something online to make them feel important. The coil whine on the Duke card was so loud I sent the card back and said I'm going to buy an EVGA 1080 Ti FTW3 and just save all that money and get a bit better performance, and feel good with EVGA. So I bought an ELITE version, it looked ok in my case, not great tbh. Performance was better than my 1080 FTW2 but here we go again, it had some coil whine and mind you I have had never had issues with coil whine EVER. So I couldn't keep this card either, it didn't look good in my case and on top of it the coil whine made me decide to buy a 2080 EVGA XC Ultra, staying with the trusted EVGA brand. Received the card and boy what a cooler on that card...2.7 slot. Ran VERY hot, it was at 55C idle with a room temp in CA of about 21C. And it had a constant buzzing even at idle and increased in games or benchmarks. And the look was absolutely horrible. Returned that one too. Was almost settling on a Gigabyte Auros 2080 just for the looks but all the reviews said it was loud and hot so I kept on looking. Then I kept hearing great things about the Asus Strix 2080 OC, I never even considered this brand although I do have their motherboard and monitor. After reading all the reviews I bought it.
This card is beautiful, the LED is subtle, it integrates so well with my system, no GPU sag, SUPER quiet idle or load and temps were unbelievable, 23C idle and 55C while gaming all on quiet settings barely hearing the fans. There is a little bit of coil whine, but after testing all the other cards this was the least noticeable and i'm convinced that the entire RTX line up suffers from it. You just have to find the one that's the most tolerable to your eardrums.
VERY happy with this card, the look is amazing, fans spinning is an enjoyable sound, the temps are unreal and really almost no coil whine. I will update if it gets worse. All in all HIGHLY recommend this card."

I have it paired with an i7-8700k @4.7GHz across all cores and 32GB of RAM @3000MHz.

It's expensive. Too much so if I'm being completely honest. But, it does a lot of things right. It runs much cooler than I would have expected, never reaching over 60 deg C in Battlefield V's campaign (which I received for free with the purchase of this card). I assumed that this card would run especially hot considering the issues the new the 20-series cards have been having. It's not entirely quiet, but I don't notice any noise when I'm gaming while wearing my normal headset (Sennheiser GSP 600).

Overall, it's a very good video card, but I knocked it down to four stars because of the price. It runs cool (so far), is extremely powerful, and has everything you need in a high-end video card."

 In the beginning I was very happy with this graphics card. It looks beautiful and was very silent. But then a few weeks after owning it, the left fan became defective. Every time the fan's speed would spin up, the fan would make this rattling sound. The graphics card started to sound like a frog ribbeting somewhere off in the distance (watch video).

Fast forward 7 months later, the card is exhibiting abnormal fan behavior under gaming load - when it reaches 68-70c fans ramp up full speed (3400 rpm) on the left & right fans off & on, the middle fan also experiences the same problem but it's fan speed ramp varies from 1800-2400 rpm with occasionally going up to 3000+ rpm but not as often as the other 2 fans. When this happens, there is also a noise when the fans go to spin up, can't pin point if it's a fan noise or some sort of electrical component on the card like coil wine. Card runs fine other wise, no loss in frame rate or artifact of any sort.

I've tried reverting to a different driver, used DDU to uninstall all drivers and install fresh drivers, set a customer fan curve in GPUtweak and to no avail still does the same thing. With a quick search on the internet it appears that this is across all brands of RTX cards and the only fix being a new card via RMA.

Submitted the card for RMA yesterday, so we will see what happens. After 4 PC builds spanning 15 years this would be my first RMA ever, so kinda worried on the outcome of it since I've read horror stories regarding them.

Going to deduct 2 stars pending RMA experience/customer service with Asus.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was long overdue for a GPU upgrade; coming from a Asus Strix GTX 970 to this RTX 2080 was a phenomenal improvement in games - seeing 50-75 % better frames depending on the game.

Boost clocks running @ 1950-1980mhz out of the box with temperatures in the 60-70's varying on the game played; the card is also quiet with the fans going up to 50% under load with the stock fan curve.

NVIDIA made bold claims with their Ray-tracing & DLSS technology; just like anything new it will take time to mature, it also depends on the game played to see the benefits from it which is only 2 games now that implement it: Battlefield 5 & Metro Exodus.

Battlefield 5 decided to use ray-tracing for reflections (which if you ask me is completely useless in such a game) to highlight this new technology, on a game so fast paced you can't enjoy it - not to mention the performance hit: DLSS also doesn't work for me, the textures are very blurry.

Now Metro: Exodus on the other hand used all of it's Ray-tracing resources to focus on lighting and shadows, and well it works great for that sort of game - a slower paced, dark game which adds another level of immersion. DLSS unfortunately doesn't work in this game too - textures look way to washed out.

Something I don't see mentioned at all is possibly one of the best of the card features; NVENC encoding improvements over the previous generation of GPU's. For a streamer this really opens up the possibility for a new streamer or even seasoned streamer to stream without having to worry about a second stream PC with great quality; especially for a person that doesn't have a CPU capable of doing it. Better quality encoding compared to x264 very fast/fast - when you step up to X264 Medium it trades blows depending on the game quality wise all while removing load of the CPU on to the GPU - I've used it, 1.0-2.0% CPU utilization, went back and watched it and the quality was amazing.

The new NVENC encoder is available across NVIDIA's full line of new Turing cards: from the new GTX 1660/1660 Ti to the flagship RTX 2080 Ti which makes it available to everyone across several price range tiers."

This card hits the sweet spot of high performance, however not really fully justifies the high price of admission. This high-end graphics card it’s on the verge of breaking the 4K 60 fps barrier that the RTX 2080 Ti smashes through. Non the less, my Fire Strike Ultra results are pretty nice.

One of the amazing thing I noticed was the immediate effects RT Cores and Nvidia RTX brings as it transforms puddles, glass and other reflective surfaces into mirrors for the first time in video games. That was a pretty neat step up from other cards.

The RTX 2080 can also tap into a new Deep Learning Super Sampling feature that’s much more efficient at applying super sampling and anti-aliasing at the same time. Those AI-injected Tensor Cores are also pivotal for Nvidia’s new super-simple overclocking features.

Popular overclocking apps like EVGA Precision X1 and MSI Afterburner have released beta builds that integrate this new NV Scanner API, which essentially tweaks your GPU up a precise micro-voltage curve and tests for stable overclock speeds and voltages. Pretty impressive if you ask me :D

So far, played ""Rise of Tomb Raider"", ""Hitman 2"", ""Elite Dangerous"", ""Fair Cry 5"" and ""Ghost Recon"" at maximum graphic settings on a 4K monitor, and all games played like a charm. Though I never really hit a constant 60fps on a 4K setting.

So in short...

GOOD:
- Great graphic performance, even in 4K
- Don't need to be overclocked to see good performances, but can be overclocked non the less
- RTX technology
- Handles lot of games at max settings even on 4K screens
- Looks good and has also programmable LED lighting effect

BAD:
- BIG bulky card that needs some space in your case, so be aware of that.
- Still VERY EXPENSIVE (at the time of writing this review 05/30/2019)

Would definitely recommend to anyone not ready to pay the crazy money of the 2080ti, and still want a great performances graphic card."

I've read the reviews on how quiet and cool this card runs and they were right! This card was running on low-70s on temperature when I had my graphics maxed out on World of Warcraft, The Division 2, PubG and Apex Legends. The only reason I did not pick up an RTX2080 Ti was that I would have to get another Power supply because I am only running on a 600W power supply. A lot of people made videos on youtube comparing the GTX 1080 Ti and the RTX 2080 Ti, most of them came out to be about the same on the fps, but after installing the graphics card and testing it out, I actually feel a difference on changing the graphics card. One good thing about getting this card is that there will be so much more NVIDIA updates coming out for the RTX so that's one thing I can look forward to.

I primarily chose this card because, it is a much shorter card than the ROG Strix which needed to be less than 280mm in length to fit in my midtower case with a radiator mounted on the front. If you want the top of the line card in a small form factor, this is it. The card is so quiet, even under load. I do recommend good case cooling (airflow) as this card can throw some heat. I overclocked this card over 2000Mhz no problem, and just used the RTX features in the game ""Control"". No words. This is not a value champion, you want that go with radeon (I do love their products by the way). You want ray tracing and top of the line graphics (without paying an additional $500 for extra frames..hmm 2080TI), then this is a great option. Everyone complains about the price, well here is my perspective, I went from a radeon rx580 to this card. It was a huge jump.

I am able to finally play all games at 4K resolution while maintaining 60 fps. I can say that the card looks amazing and was easy to install. The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because of the price. The GTX 1080 TI was around $700 when it launched. So they want us to pay $100 for the inclusion of Ray Tracing, which is only available on one game at 1080p. I needed an upgrade, but I am not happy with the price. I also wish the pilot lights for the PCIe power in weren't so bright. They are distracting from the lighting on the card. So far, the card performs as promised and I am happy with my purchase. I am excited to see what the future of real-time Ray Tracing will hold."

I'm currently running a 21x9 aspect ratio / 1080x2560 monitor and in that resolution this GPU crushes just about all games with all max/ultra settings at triple digit framerates. This card probably makes more sense for someone wanting to run 2K at relatively competitive framerates or 4K at playable framerates. That being said having pro gamer level framerates (not that im a pro by any means) with ray tracing and ultra settings turned on in multi player on the new modern warfare is nice to have. Its a hulking beast of a card so some card sag is going to happen unless you support the front end of the card somehow. It makes enough heat when its running all out during gaming that it will turn your pc into a space heater so make sure you have tornado level case ventilation if air cooling your cpu or front/intake mounting your cpu radiator if you want to run this bad boy and have it get along with your cpu temps. The only downside other than the high price is the RGB is a bit lackluster compared to many other GPU's (just an republic of gamers text logo on the outward facing side, ROG ""mean eye"" on top, and some bottom mounted light strips) but this beast is about performance not show. If you're not willing to pony up an even more ridiculous amount of money for a 2080ti this is the next best thing and will surely not disappoint."

The fans don't run at all and power consumption is actually a little less than the 2060 OC it replaced. Noise even at full power is very nicely controlled and the new fan design works! The 2060 (also an Asus) got a LOT louder when it was cranking the fans to maintain the temperature profile but these are barely audible while keeping it to 77C in a 77F room. This is the bios fan profile and they aren't running at full speed to maintain 77C so there's headroom to spare.

Web surfing and YouTube watching doesn't get it over 45C and the fans don't come on until 50 or so....the 2060 minimum fan speed was 1250 or thereabouts so this is quieter for sure. The 2060 ran hot enough that I changed thermal compound for Conductonaut which brought things down a few degrees....but this 2080 doesn't need anything. It's like the 2060 but 1/3 bigger and barely fit in the case...but happily it did. Clearance to the hard drive rack is tight but it's in.

Time Spy scores are 11430 with all settings to max quality and a Ryzen 5 3600 and I use it mostly for a driving sim which it runs effortlessly and I'm sure it would run any game out there with excellent frame rates and picture quality. Sad that they cost so much...but you only cry once and then get to enjoy an excellent video performance every time you fire up the computer. I'm sure the 2080 Ti outperforms it....but for the money I think this is a better value and all around performer for daily use. Very happy with the Asus 2080 Super OC 8G."

Initially, I was waiting for the 20* series cards, with the hope that the 1080 TI would go on sale or the 20 series would come in at the same cost as the 10 series.

With plans not going as expected, I watched the market and waited as manufacturers released their custom cards. This card had great reviews, and I know anything coming from Asus was likely to be top notch.

So far, this card has handled anything I can throw at it with ease. I have not attempted any raytracing functions, but that was not the reason I purchased this card. The card does increase the sound level of my PC, but not too an unbearable level. I have it set to prioritize temperatures, not sound, and have no issues."

Since I like having my whole system on my laptop but didn't want to upgrade my whole system, I thought I'd give the eGPU concept a try with the RTX 2080 Super. My Laptop's internal GPU, a Quadro M1000M will not run in parallel with it (please, if you have a Quadro graphics card, just disable it; I manged to brick my computer 3 times because GeForce and Quadro had some disagreements). However, by disabling my internal GPU, my laptop's CPU (Intel Xeon E3-1505M) is no longer sharing the same heatpipe and can run at its based clock of 2.8 GHz on all four cores consistently now that I have off loaded the performance onto the GPU. In benchmarking tests, I tend to score around the 30% for 2080 Super cards, so if you are considering an eGPU, know that hope is not lost and you will still get most of your performance. That said, I do use external monitors when using my eGPU which improves performance. For Assassin's creed Odyssey, I can play at maxed out settings at 4K with around 30 to 60 frames per second."

I bought it to replace a cheaper card in order to have a VR capable machine. However the ports are too close to the edge of the card.

Not sure if it's the SKU itself, or this particular card, but about a week into using it the RGB functionality of the card went out, no big deal right? However it was indicative of a larger problem. A few days later, I experienced a glitch while playing League of Legends, where every few seconds the in game screen (Fullscreen) would go black. This was fixed with a simple alt+tab and back, however in a fast paced ranked setting this is unacceptable. This continued the entirety of the match, I reinstalled drivers, and game with a clean reinstall each. Experienced the same issue, which was most concerning seeing as the video card was putting up over 200 fps numbers in every title I own except CoD:MW. A few more days later, the video card had issues rendering the windows desktop background image (a simple JPEG, no active background or slideshow function being used). This is even more worrying as the system is running on a 5.1ghz across all 8 cores 9900ks, so the GUI rendering issue can only be graphics related. This was confirmed by switching in a 970 GTX and not experiencing any of the same issues.

Great card, great performance (when working as intended), however this particular SKU has had multiple issues in less than a month. Can not recommend."

I've had this gpu installed for a bit and it's been great. I built my first computer and everything went smooth with this gpu. The prices have been fluctuating for awhile, I got it direct from Amazon for $250 prime shipped. It was a toss up between the MSI, Asus or this Gigabyte 1660 Super. I chose this 1660 Super because it has 3 fans, 3 copper heatpipes across full length of radiator, simple black/grey color scheme, rgb controllable logo, 3 display port 1.4 and 1 hdmi. Other than that, all three gpu's are the same specs. I used Afterburner to make adjustments and to have an aggressive fan curve. GPU temps never go above 60 deg Celcius, even after long periods of gaming. And I can't even hear the 3 fans with my current settings. Initially, I had the gpu fans full blast........negative ghost rider, too loud, not going to Mars yet lol. I was going to go with a 2070 Super, but with the new Nvidia cards on the horizon I chose to hold off and go lower tier for now. Overall I'm very pleased with this card. I would recommend this card, IF you can get it for $250."

The good:
I have not overclocked beyond the factory overclock and Userbenchmark has mine in the 93rd percentile for 1660 Supers. Since this is the 3 fan model temps are great: idle 38-43c, gaming 58-63c in my high airflow case. It's whisper quiet using the stock fan curve. With the fans stopped under 50c that means they aren't even running unless I'm gaming. And when I am the temps stay low enough that the fans never get up to an audible RPM.

It easily maintains 60+ FPS with max settings at 1080p in every gamy I've played, and most of the time much higher FPS than that. This card is also in a sweet spot when comparing price/performance. 1660 Ti's typically run only 3-5% faster yet cost 15-20% more.

The not so good:
There are only 2 negatives I can think of, and neither were enough for me to deduct a star:
1) The RGB Gigabyte logo is pretty dim. During the day it's actually kind of hard to tell that it's on, even with the brightness maxed. Not a big deal to me, but may be to you if you're going for a flashy RGB build.
2) The GPU noticeably sags and I've only had it about a week. Also not a big deal since you can find on the internet tests showing it doesn't impact performance and causes no harm to the PCB since they are designed to be flexible. Still, GPU supports exist if it's a big deal to you.

I didn't want to spend too much on a video card with the RTX 3000 series coming out later this year. I figured I would temporarily use this and hand it down to my nephew when the new series came out. But honestly this card has all the power you need for 1080p gaming."

Using destiny 2 as an example at 1080p on the 480 I would get around 85-95ish frames a second on medium settings. Now with this card I was getting easily 115-120 + on the same settings. On the highest settings it only dipped into the low 100s. It’s also a much more quieter card, the 480 would get up to 90c on destiny, this card only gets to 60c.

Comes with everything noted, including four solid miniDP to DP converters. Card came in sealed bag, shipped with a DVD with drivers on it as well.

Hardware wise this card has a GPU, but it's not one really designed for games. It's got enough power to do most basic things while driving four displays. That includes things like video encoding, decoding, and some 3D boosts. To be super clear this is NOT DESIGNED FOR GAMING, but for business use. And it does exceptionally well at doing that with most apps one would use for business (CAD software, editing, etc).

The only minor disappointment was that the GPU driver is apparently not versioned correctly (or possibly not strong enough?) to support enhancing zoom conferencing with virtual backgrounds. It may be that the hardware could support it, but Zoom doesn't see the version info it wants and simply refuses to try. Hopefully that will be corrected if it can at some point in the future."

Operations- I have 4 screens, (2) 27 inch planar monitors and (2) 24 inch Acer's. As soon as I make a profit trading I will upgrade to all 27 inch monitors, this video card can easily handle the resolution and speed requirements for trading.
Gaming- I have a PS3 for that, so I don't know

I've seen no performance issues, I've heard no annoying fan noises, the card just works right out the box."

The 420 has been discontinued. The 510 is significantly faster, slightly less expensive, and easier to install and connect. The 510 uses 4 mini display port connectors rather than the VHDCI connector on the older card. Mini display ports just seem a heck of a lot easier to connect. Card came with full height bracket installed and the short bracket if I needed it (I did). The 510 has 2 GB vs 512 MB of the 420, as well as 192 CUDA cores vs 16 in the 420,

We replaced two 5 year old nVidia gaming cards which were stating to become unstable. This installation simplified the computer layout, as no power cords to to PCI Express card were necessary and greatly increased internal space as the card design is low profile. Three days in the video is very stable and the primary user is able to control all video functions.

The only negative is that the card we ordered did not come with DisplayPort to DVI-D adapters despite showing their inclusion on the Amazon, PNY Web Site, and the card packaging. A call to PNY customer service was not productive as they said I ordered the wrong part number. We had to purchase new cables locally which added about $40 to the cost."

High capability - fan speed at 45% under maximum load. Quiet and high FPS.

Easy enough to install taking out my old card, requires an 8 & 6 pin VGA power cable connector.

Booted my system the first time, downloaded NVIDIA control panel and boom, done in 20 minutes. You receive a GPU support brace too in the package which is nice, I would've used it but i'm in a small case.

Expect this card to give you 80-100+ FPS on 1440p with max settings on triple A titles. For competitive titles like CSGO you’ll get 280+ FPS 1440p on max detail.

Ran it through UNIGENE - Superposition Benchmark and it did great 1440p at 78-80 FPS everything cranked to maximum (shaders were high not extreme) and only rose to 67c with 100% utilization, fans at 45% you’d basically have to stick your head to the case to hear anything.

But if your coming from an AMD card Specifically a RX 580 Power Color Red Devil Golden Sample version. Not overly impressed with the 2070 super performance, looking at all the u tubers benches I expected more. I am a big AMD fan Boy so theres that. But I am tired of waiting for AMD to catch up to nvidia on performance so I jumped the fence. uninstalled my old AMD drivers using a uninstall complete program to try to completely remove all AMD drivers. I installed the card and downloaded the latest drivers from nvidia and ran a few bench test and it was slower than my AMD card, Overclocked the Nvidia card in afterburner software and still slower. Next formatted and reloaded a fresh install of windows 10 plus formatted my game drives 80 plus games reinstalled games fresh. Got a bit better than my old AMD card. But I'm still running the Nvidia 2070 super on a AMD MSI X 470 board with a Ryzen 5 3600 6 core 12 thread cpu at 4.2 hrz all cores. So there are still some AMD chipset drivers that have to be used. MSI Mystic light stopped working for this card. Turns out there are some conflicts with AMD mother board chipset drivers and Nvidia based MSI mystic light video cards.
So in closing if you switch from AMD to Nvidia on a AMD board and CPU expect some problems. I think this card is great but on my real world use case i'm not sure it was worth the expense my AMD card was about 280 bucks this Nvidia card was 580 ish. This card looks great maybe I'll get it runing better if I figure out some of the unknown conflicts between AMD and Nvidia. My 3 stars are not a reflection on MSI or this card I think its could be a great card specs indicate it should be great compared to my old AMD RX 580 .If your on an Intel based system you may not have the same problems I'm having. I think this MSI RTX 2070 Super card could be a 5 star used in a Intel rig.
Update 12/21/2019 after some messing around and uninstall AMD motherboard chip set drivers got Mystic light software going again. Been doing some tweaking of some settings got the latest undated Nvivdia drivers. Performance is better now I'm seeing some major gains in frames per second and card is running much cooler than my old AMD rx 580. Starting to see the gains turning on some of the eye candy in my games settings. change my reveive from 3 to 5 star. I'm running this card with a GPU boost of 1980 mhz and it hitting just over 2000 mhz constantly under game loads temps not bad the highest I seen is 67 c fans only spinning at 44 % I have to look to see if they are really on, can't hear them at all. GPU boost is insane since its rated at 1800 mhz"

Pros:
- RGB looks great
- Well built and cools well
- Can actually run RTX games at 60-70 fps on my 1080p monitor with settings at ultra (Metro Exodus).

Cons:
- This card is ONE THICC BOI. Measure your case and make sure you can fit it. I have a Phanteks P300 and it fits but just barely.
- If RGB isn't your thing MSI makes a similar card for ~$40 cheaper."

RGB is not my thing but I can't turn it off because MSI application does not run on Windows 7. This card is a good value for the money comparing with 2080, unless you have unlimited budget. The card is very quiet except for the coil whine under very high load. I only run one game on it and it runs well without any coil whine. So if you are getting it for games, I think it is a good choice.
As someone already mentioned, the card is rather large. I had to buy a new case as it did not fit in my old Wavemaster 2 case because of HDD cages getting in the way. Make sure to check your case against the card dimensions.
Not sure why it is asking for 650W power supply, I measured my PC consumption under load and it was 328W.
The card run just fine in PCIe2.1 slot, in case anyone is wondering if that is possible. I moved it to more modern AMD-B450 motherboard since then and it also runs fine."

Doesn't get hot, looks amazing, provides the ability to play games at max settings. I bought this super because the 2080ti is still way too expensive, but honestly I don't see a reason to even upgrade past the 2070super since every game I've played has been on max settings, while streaming or recording. The mystic light features are awesome, having the lights ""breath"" or start flashing with my glass case looks so beautiful. Trust me, get this over the regular 2070. If you can afford the 2080ti then for sure go that route, but I have no regrets here.

The only con I can find is that it's heavy. But to me that's not a problem since both the gpu and my case came with a brace to help hold it up. Also it's pretty big, make sure you get a case that can give you enough space to install it. The thing is a monster, you'll honestly not be disappointed!

I haven’t used it for more than some destiny 2 and diablo 3 on 4K gaming wise. So hard to say if it’s not reaching expectations.

Even if you don’t care for rtx, the rtx 20 series is still considerably faster than the previous gtx 10 series still making it worth the buy. The 2070 super almost performs the same as the $200-$300 more expensive gtx 1080ti meaning you'd have to go to the rtx 2080 series if you wanted to have something faster than the 1080ti.

5 stars for gaming because it runs every game I throw at it at 1080p fully maxed out graphics no lower than 75fps. This card is perfect for high fps 1080p with maxed graphics or 1440p 60+fps on fully maxed graphics for most games. Games like borderlands 3 though suffer due to extreme optimization issues. Back to 1080p, Forza horizon 4 never dips below 75 fully maxed out, black ops 3 almost always runs at the full 144fps for my 144hz panel meaning it has more potential for something extra like a 165hz panel if BO3 is your thing, rainbow 6 siege rarely dips below 120fps as far as I tested, destiny 2 stays above 100fps in matchmaking until you do PvE in the open world to where it drops as low as the 70's (probably another optimization issue regarding the MMO server), and the temperatures never hit 70°C at least with the previous fan curve I set for my previous MSI RX580. Except this card makes half the noise leading to the next review.

5 stars on noise level because for how much cooler this runs compared to my msi RX580, it is surprisingly much quieter. With the same fan curve on both cards, the 2070 I received runs 7°C to 10°C cooler than the rx580 it's replacing. Considering the fan curves are based off percentages, the fans on the 2070 seem to spin slower yet keep the die cooler leading to another point that this card cools exceptionally well. The heat syncs are massive, the whole card will blow your mind with it's large size if you've never seen one in person so I'd make sure that it will fit in your system first.

As far as little things, the rgb is a nice touch and much better than what the gigabyte model of the card has but this card is more expensive. The fan and cover design just makes the card look aesthetically pleasing and in a way, aggressive in general, the metal brushed aluminum backplate engraved with the msi logo looks really nice as well and gives the card a much higher quality feel and look. It comes with a support bracket which unfortunately for me, wont fit in my case due to an obstruction where the gpu mounting screws go but the card doesn’t really sag for me so it’s fine, others might have better luck with the bracket.

In conclusion, this card is very solid in virtually every aspect and for the money, I say it was worth the buy so long as it keeps working like it is."

My 970 still works and is a solid card, but it was having trouble running Skyrim VR on Oculus with the wabbajack Ultimate mod list (circa 400 pre-pracked mods). I sort of guessed it was a GPU issue and not something else because the game would run very well inside a house or dungeon (less load items) but would drop frames really bad if I was traveling in the open (more grass, trees, animals, etc). (970 could run vanilla VR pretty well though).
So I decided to upgrade to the 2070 SUPER and WOW, now it runs absolutely perfect everywhere, including the openworld with the full wabbajack mod-list. I can even guide the bow and arrow to head-shot an elk across a long distance. (took 10 tries, my realistic aiming sucks but no judder nor graphics issues).
As far as this particular model, I also do not notice any noise nor whine even running some intensive graphics games (looking at you AI Shoujo, another game that my 970 couldn't run beyond 30-40 fps now running smooth as butter) but I've only had the card for a couple days.
Card comes with clear instructions, a cool metal brace for extra support. So far extremely happy with the purchase. I'll come back to this review in a month or two.

No coil whine, barely audible unless you've been gaming for hours, and even then it's remarkably quiet. Additionally it ships with one BIOS so no need to switch between two of them.

The card comes with a brace, and I recommend using it. Although it's a dual fan card, it's a beefy dual fan card. Check your case compatibility.

Good deal if you don't overpay. If real time ray tracing reminds you of running DirectX 10 on the old GeForce 8800's; you're probably right. Get a 5700XT if you want to save money. If you're patient enough for Ampere, or RDNA 2..."

This card is very cool at idle workload temperature around 30-36 C, when gaming on full load, it can reach 62-68 C never reached higher to me.

But the card was in perfect working order, the price was right, and it gets the job done, so I'm taking just one star off for the dodgy packaging.

A little background: I was recently re-purposing a ~6 year old desktop motherboard to build a Linux-based home file server, and wanted a cheap, low-power video card. The motherboard does not have an onboard GPU, and I wanted something that wouldn't take up the PCIe x16 slot, since I wanted to use the PCIe x16 slot for an LSI 8-port SATA/SAS controller. This card does exactly what I need -- basic display for OS installation (and troubleshooting down the road if needed), and sits in the motherboard's (otherwise completely useless) legacy PCI slot.

For those complaining about lack of a driver CD and poor resolution/clarity, please keep in mind that ATI Rage is a more than 2 decade old GPU architecture, dating back to the Windows 95/98 era. We're talking about a time when DirectX 5 was considered bleeding edge, and 1024x768 XGA CRTs were still common (if not the norm). Even if drivers for Windows 7 and later were available for this card, it would still look like crap if you asked it to display a modern desktop environment.

This card's niche is basically what I'm using it for -- to cheaply add basic low-resolution display capability to a motherboard that doesn't have a built-in GPU. If that's your use case, I think you'll be happy with it. If you're expecting more than that, you'll probably be disappointed."

On boot up, it defaults to two of the VGA monitors mirroring each other as primary no matter which ports I plug the monitors into. I have not discovered a way to make either of the DVI connectors primary, so the BIOS screen always comes up on an inconveniently positioned secondary monitor. A minor annoyance, as once it boots into Windows 10 the OS allows me to configure the primary monitor as I wish, and it stops mirroring and allows me to stretch the desktop over six independent monitors. In order to get six monitors working, I had to connect four of them in VGA mode and two in DVI mode, necessitating the purchase of four DisplayPort to VGA adaptors. The card wouldn't work with more than three DVI monitors connected. Counterintuitive, given that the card is advertised as having no analog functionality. Nevertheless, I now have six monitors connected and it is a performance increase over the two video cards that this one replaced to power my six monitors. The price point was excellent, and there is really no other card that does what this one does as inexpensively."

This is a huge pet peeve of mine and it falsely lowers the overall ratings which forces everyone to read between the lines when reading amazon reviews! Reviewers you need a working card to do a proper review and although D.O.A. cards still occur it's part of technology so just accept it and send it back for a new card under the 3 year Asus warranty or Amazons 30 day return/replace policy.
I only buy AMD Radeon video cards because Nvidia really over prices their GPU's, chipsets, and power supplies by at least 30 % and I'm not over paying for video cards no matter who produces them.
I wanted to get a good card that plays well at 1920x1080p and will still play my Military Flight Simulators and F.P.S. games without any issues. The Asus RX 570 was plenty fast enough for gaming and even scored a 71% in 3DMark which is great for a 7 year old system still running a i5 2500k CPU.

I do not over- clock my CPU (But it will run at almost 5 GHZ if I chose to do so since I have a nice closed loop water cooler) I also will never over-clock my GPU because I want stability over speed. Over-clocking really helped out back in the past with the 66 MHZ bus on the intel PII's that ran at 333 MHZ. These hit perfectly on a 100 MHZ bus giving me a rock stable CPU running at 500 MHZ back when intel didn't even have a 400 MHZ CPU on the market!
But that was then and now a days the intel CPU's are being milked for all intel can get while they change their socket sizes so your forced to buy a new board as well.
This Asus RX-570 is well built even though it's fan cover is plastic it's rather light which eliminates sag issues so it's a plus not a negative. I bought it for the double ball bearing fans and 8 gig of DDR5! I waited a year for the prices to get back to normal from all the bitcoin miners and this card is well worth the money and then some. For only $162 this 570 with 8 gig of onboard ram is great value!
I don't recommend using the Asus software that comes with the card since it's very buggy and the Radeon settings can be set just fine without any additional software.

Asus Expedition RX-570_8 GIG video card Update:
I have been using the new card for almost 4 months and it runs great with both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 10 Pro 64 bit O/S's
I recently went back to Win 7 Pro over Win 10 Pro because Win 10 Pro would not run 2 of my favorite Military Sims. Well they would load and I could finish a mission but then the game would crash my system and force me to lose any pilot stats, which ruins the fun of playing realistic flight sims and could have led to some hard restarts that can damage the O/S. I know from personal use that Win 7 Pro 64 bit just runs games better than Windows 10, when it comes to compatibility, and is still a solid Operating System that most gamers still use.
Windows 10 Pro gets bad reviews across the board but I found it to be an excellent O/S with only Linux's latest being more stable and of course free.
O.K. back to the new video card. I can't find any flaws with this card at all. It lacks a black-plate but is really light weight and has a great closed loop heat pipe system, along with the great, real, ball bearing fans, that are so quiet I can't even hear them while I'm gaming. There is zero whine that other cards produce under load and I love that feature.
I only needed a good video card with 4 gig of ram and was looking at a RX-560, but this Asus card and it's 8 gig of DDR5 gave my system and game performance a great boost and was well worth the year long wait not to over pay.

If you need a solid card with quiet fans and like the idea of 8 gig of DDR 5 ram look no further! I have seen a couple of Sapphire cards inthe RX-580 series in July of 2019 priced at only $180 which would have been my first choice if I was buying today. But you can drive yourself crazy if you keep looking at current GPU's prices since the new Radeons are out and getting cheaper all the time. So I always get the best single card for the money and can always buy a second if I upgrade my CPU to a AMD Ryson 1600, my motherboard with a AM4 socket and 16 gig of DDR4 memory.
I priced out this upgrade path and for $450 I can basically get a brand new computer(self built) and add a second Asus RX-570 for Cross-Fire use.
I have bought Sapphire cards in the past and have had good luck with them however, they only have a 2 year warr. and that extra year that Asus offers can be important. I did have a Asus HD 6950 years ago that failed after 2 1/2 years and would have been a paperweight if I didn't have that extra year of warranty as Asus replaced it with no questions asked. I do tend to buy Asus motherboards and video cards since they have good RMA service and a full 3 year warranty on their boards and video cards."

My graphics card now stays between 34-45c even when gaming... Why ohh why would they program their products to run only when it reaches 62c?????????

One obvious reason would be planned obsolescence, by running hotter for longer periods of time it degrades the lifespan exponentially. forcing us ( the consumers ) to purchase their products again and again to boost their sales. Actions are either deliberate or the product of ignorance... so which do you think is happening here? Are we to believe that a multi million dollar corporation "" just dropped the ball"" in the R&D area regarding thermal degradation? Or a much more simple explanation did you do it knowing it would cause issues with longevity?

Either way its shady. Buyer beware"

However, I have always been impressed by Asus products so I decided to lean on the brand reputation and make the purchase. I had no hiccups in the installation of this video card. I installed it in my computer along withthe AMD radeon drivers.(19.4.2) I also installed the Asus GPU tweaker II software. Because of the negative reviews I wanted to stress test the card right away to make sure I didn't have a dud. I ran Furmark for an hour and it had no problems. I did find that it was throttling the clock speed down to about 900mhz during the stress test. I had to turn up the power limit in GPU tweaker to get it to hold the max clock speed under load. Overall I think it is a good product, it works and performs as expected for a mid level graphics card."

This card is insanely good compared to my old GTX 1060 and can run many games on high or ultra. It is super quiet even while under heavy load and the temperatures are really good compared to Nvidia cards. The issue that I am having is random stuttering during gameplay. It was not noticeable at first but it became annoying after a couple days of gaming. The stuttering happens every time the GPU's core clocks would drop, the core clocks on my card are never stable and keeps dropping frequency at random times causing annoying stutter. The stuttering is just too annoying and noticeable during gaming and I will be planning on returning this card for another brand. Looking at the reviews I see nobody has this issue, perhaps I am just unlucky and got a defective model."

My assembly was in a Corsair Spec 04 so dimensions were not an issue. The tiny PurpleBlue LED does not match my scheme but is small enough to not be a factor. As well is an ASUS card with ASUS B350M Prime board matching in material color.

In Windows the HDMI did not work until the current drivers were installed. Luckily displayport adapters were at hand. Additionally the manufacturer utility is very handy, with OSD options.

My expectations were based for a 1080p 60hz display. Through my library it can be seen as a meeting or exceeding performer. Keeping in mind the graphically intense games would need settings adjusted."

This is a nice GPU but it is a hot head. Partly my motherboard layout has the GPU pressed almost directly against the CPU cooling tower which does not help. Unfortunately this big hulking GPU never turns its fans on which might help the heat dissipation situation. Whoever came up with HOT GPU's turning off their fans should be fired never to work again in IT.

I would not buy this GPU because, it saves you money on your energy bill at the expense of heating up everything else that shares its space.

I put this card in a Dell Optiplex 7010 i7 w/16 GB RAM. I was using 3 monitors with two separate low-tech video cards that came with this business-oriented PC. One was a single DVI the second a DVI/Displayport/VGA. With 3 monitors video performance was adequate for office apps and that was about it. Video looked like it was being projected by an 8mm projector (anyone remember those?)

This one card replaces both old cards and is driving the three monitors without problem. Video playback is now at least as good as my HD TV and the colors seem much crisper. And what is best for me is the short form factor. The Dell's MB has the SATA connectors directly behind the PCIe slots (stupid design or what...) that prevent use of a longer video card.

I also bumped up the original budget power supply to an EVGA 600W (this video card requires a separate power connection which the original PS did not have). Overall the machine seems snappier and ""happier"" and hasn't crashed since I did the upgrade (about 2 months now). Can computers seem happy? This one does, I'm convinced the original PS was causing the once-a-week crashes I was seeing in the past. Overall I'm quite happy with the purchase and would do so again."

I've had the GT740SC for about a month now. The extra power plug is very much appreciated considering how often I want to beef up some power connections that go threw the motherboard. I have never been disappointed by EVGAs build quality.

Unfortunately, the cons of the 'Chip' in the card make this just not worth it for so many. As an upgrade from the GT730 (GK208) it is more of a downgrade then an upgrade. It consumes three times the power and cant muster any more then a third more CUDA performance over it's smaller sibling. At over three-hundred percent more watts and no more then thirty percent more performance, the GT740 (GK107) chip just is not worth it at all. It would be better to duck-tape three GT730 (GK208) chips together then to get the GT740 for CUDA work, or get a different chip.

For gaming, the GT730 and GT740 are lackluster at best. They are about twice as good as the nine year old NX8600GT, and play newer games about as well, if you can put up with reduced play settings. The only thing that the GT730 has going for it over the GT740 is a lack of a fan for silent PC uses that do not involve gaming (HTPC, DAW, etc). The GT740 burns way more power and dose not give you much more at all to work with, and it would not be the best choice in a silent application with the exaggerated heat it produces.

I can't put the GT740 in my studio DAW machine, It lacks the grunt for newer games, and it won't work in many servers as well (there are better options). I can not think of an area where this chip will excel to be honest."

The card I replaced was a GeForce 600 series type. The old card's fan was on it's death bed as the fan was moaning (actually making a binding sound), so it was time to find a new one. I shopped around on a few sites, researched a bit making sure this card would A) Fit, and B) be compatible, it met both of these requirements. And overall this card had good ratings, the most common complaint being the fan was ""loud"". I found this to be somewhat accurate it is a little loud but not too bad, truth be told. If your using your system where you need silence or next to zero background noise then I wouldn't recommend this card. With that said, this card works really well and we're happy with it's performance. I'll not that we use our computer for typical home uses, schooling and general production type work, photos, emails and some designing. I can't give an honest assessment on gaming since we don't really play any games on our computer. If you're concerned about installing and removing the cards, there are videos on Youtube on how to do this, it's really easy. As for installing the driver/software that too isn't bad. If the card you're replacing is an NVIDIA like this one the installation is straight forward and you have a couple of options. You can either the delete the drivers for the current card and install the new ones for this card via the NVIDIA website, or install the new drivers from the NVIDIA's site and it'll remove the old and install the drivers for you. There differing opinions on which method is best but for the average user it really doesn't matter. If your card isn't NVIDIA then you'll need to uninstall/delete those drivers prior to installing the new card. There are tons of resources on how to replace your graphics card, remember Google is your friend.

In summary this card works really well for general purpose type usage. Again I can't comment on gaming quality. This card should work in most systems images are great and 3D ability if you're setup for it. Fan is a little loud but tolerable, though some may find it annoying. And make sure to check if this is the card with the mini HDMI versus standard size, if it's the mini then some will need to buy an adapter, so check the product description since the reviews for the cards are blended together."

I'm not a hardcore gamer, and I do not need what I play to run at ultra-high settings, but this has made my experience with more modern games much more enjoyable, especially at so reasonable a price. Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous and runs flawlessly on high settings, for example. I've been playing around for a few hours tonight and it's been running quiet and cool under a fairly decent load. My only complaint (and it is more my case's fault) is the placement of the HDMI outputs. They are extremely close to the edge of the mounting bracket; so much so that I couldn't use the full-sized port, and had to cut down some of the plastic around a mini hdmi adapter I had to get it to fit, so watch out if you have an older or smaller PC case, otherwise I you really can't do better for a modern, high spec but cost effective video card.

So after a month of hard use the card is still working great. Graphics do get bogged down a bit if you run a program or two in the background, but nothing too serious. I've run this for the better part of 12 hours under heavy load recently and it's preformed like a champ through it all. For a budget card I am thoroughly impressed."

I just built a brand new computer with two brand new LG monitors. I chose this card because it specifically said it was for multi monitor setups.

Both LG monitors provide VGA cables, not DVI . The LG monitors not only had connections for VGA but also a standard HDMI slot. The EVGA card has one DVI, one DVI-D and one mini HDMI slot. They also provide an adapter for VGA to DVI. I don’t understand why they have a mini HDMI and not a standard?

I hooked up monitor one to the DVI slot with the provided adapter. No issues there. I ran into issues with the second monitor. Since no second adapter was provided I bought one and tried to hook up the second LG with the VGA to DVI-D adapter. The second monitor was black and said there was no signal. I checked the display settings and made sure it was checked to stretch the image on both monitors, both monitors were shown in the display settings, I did a restart and still the second monitor would not come to life and its power button just flashed on and off. I tried a different monitor with the same hookup and it still would not come to life. I then hooked up the new LG to my old computer by HDMI cable and it came to life so there is no issue with the monitor. I surmised maybe there is a problem with the DVI-D to VGA adapter.

I then tried an HDMI (standard) to HDMI mini but I had problems with the mini portion connecting to the video card. The only thing I can think of is maybe the pins were bent in the EVGA mini slot even though it was brand new! I ordered a new DVI-D adapter as well as an HDMI (standard) to DVI-D cable figuring that one of these should work. I called EVGA and got through to someone right away and they spoke English! We went through all the troubleshooting and it was determined it was a faulty card. They offered to RMA it and even do a cross ship RMA so I am not without a card. Since the item was still within the 30 days from where I bought it from I ordered a new one and returned the current one as defective. Its been about 6 months and I have had no issues with the new card. Recently I had dealings with MSI and I can tell you EVGA customer service is vastly superior to them.

REVIEW:
I bought this for my son and installed it in my machine just to play around with it before I put it in his machine since he was with the grandparents for the weekend. I use an ATI 7750, which I thought was a relatively decent card. This card blew it away! I played Elder Scrolls online on ultra, and it handled it. I couldn't play long-term like that because you can certainly feel the strain on the card, but on medium settings the game still looked beautiful and worked smooth as butter. Way better than my 7750 was doing. Since this was a side-by-side comparison I have to say Nvidia has definitely impressed me. I've been an ATI junkie for a while, but I might just have to switch back. Keep in mind, at the price, this really is more of an economy gaming card, and it fits in my son's Dell Optiplex ""modified"" 755 with upgraded power supply, which a double-wide will NOT fit.

As always, EVGA makes a great product with solid components and the card looks and feels high quality.

Anyway, if you need an economy card, or have a Dell that the engineers built to only accept single-width video card, then this card is a great fit."

Luckily I'm not a gamer; I'm using my system for general computing, Photoshop, streaming/watching discs, but wanted to improve the graphics performance over my silent Asus card.

I've just upgraded/rebuilt my system in an  NZXT H440 , and it's SO quiet the only things I can hear are the spinners when they're seeking, so, again, I was hesitant to buy a card with a fan... I needn't have worried. The card installed under Win7 Pro without any problems, either with the hardware or the drivers, and it can't be heard!

To give the card a bit of a work-out I transcoded an mkv file with MediaEspresso, which fully supports hardware acceleration so will use the cards CUDA cores. The conversion took just over 30 minutes; using Handbrake, which does NOT support hardware acceleration, the same mkv file took about 2hrs to convert, maxing out my Quad Core i7 the whole time! For what it's worth, the card also returns a Windows Experience score of 7.3, and runs in my Ubuntu v14.04 LTS VM without any problems.

The card runs cool and quiet, it takes up two slots but it's not a ""brick"" that needs additional support, it does need to be powered from your PSU, and includes a 6 Pin/Double Molex adapter. For what I do, and for less than $100, I would definitely recommend this card."

Not a huge move, but I was looking for something in the $100 range. I got this for $84 (with sales tax) on an Amazon Warehouse Deal.

The card was listed as Used-Very Good condition. It arrived nicely packaged in 2 layers of bubble-wrap, this was probably a return item and did not include the usual install disc, etc.

Installation was very smooth. After a few tweaks, everything was up and running.

My current setup is: MSI 970A-G46 motherboard
Rosewill 630-watt PSU
AMD FX-6300 6-core CPU
Crucial Ballistix Sport RAM - 8GB
Arctic CPU cooler
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit SP1
and the GT 740

I built this to be a low-budget gaming rig to play games like World of Warships, World of Tanks, and Armored Warfare.

The card does run hot - according to MSI Afterburner, mine has sometimes maxed-out at 115 deg. F. But that's after a battle or 2. The fan on mine is very quiet and I have a well-ventilated case. You will need a PSU that has a 6-pin power connector (or maybe a suitable adapter), and may need a DVI-VGA adapter or a mini-HDMI / HDMI cable for your monitor.

All in all, I definitely think I got a good value for the price. Games that used to run at 18-24 FPS on the lowest possible settings now are at 45-65 FPS on Med / Very High settings."

I was considering scrapping my desktop PC & building a new desktop PC from scratch, prior to purchasing this wonderful Graphics card. This graphics card has been worth Every Penny & Breathed A Completely New Lease of life into my old PC.

A Wonderful piece of hardware & A Huge, Huge Difference to the overall speed & quality of My PC & its processing power, even with the same processor I have had for the last 5 years, my system has gone from barely being able to play games like BioShock & Far Cry 1 on the lowest settings to now being able to play Alien Isolation on Ultra Settings.
Granted Games like Far Cry 3 & Trials Fusion have to have medium settings to run smoothly and I haven't yet tried Far Cry 4, but considering my system couldn't even come close to running any of them before, I am Super Happy with the results. :D:D:D:D

UPDATE: The Graphics Card continues to work Above & Beyond My Expectations, I have had really only one moment of lag in photoshop, which has been when trying some of 'Photoshops' own 'Processor Heavy Tablet Brushes' . Although have NEVER used them for work, so its not been an issue that has affected my work.
(I just tried them out as they were always SUPER laggy in the past, now they just slightly lag).
My Normal Brushes and Personally Created Brushes work fine without any lag, as does everything else I use within Photoshop.

As for Games, I recently installed & have been playing 'Shadow of Mordor' and its been running wonderfully for the most part.
Although I have noticed that the more open-world the game, the more the processor seems be pushed to its limits.
I bring this up as there have been the odd moments when there are perhaps 20-50 enemies onscreen when within a section of the game containing lots of buildings & background details, and being attacked by those 20-50enemies all at once, then slowdown does occur (to the point that the controls have become lagged and unresponsive).
That's not to say it always happens, there have been occasions when my character has fought 40+ characters in a build-up graphical area/ city section and its been fine, it seems to be more dependent upon the 'complexity' of the background/ setting where the battle is taking place. and so far it has only occurred in 1 section during the second half of the game.

I believe this is also why Alien Isolation was able to run on Ultra Settings, because the game is broken up into separately loaded sections.

Even so, I still rate this product with 5 Stars, as it continues to be wonderful value for money."

The $200 he saved on this card versus the next DDR5 card that would even fit in the case was huge. The interface software also makes it very easy for him to learn what various settings are and how they affect gameplay.

It's a whole different world from the first time I built a computer.

If you have a lot of money and a lot of choices and are building from the ground up, no hundred dollar card will be the gpu of your dreams.

The card comes with a Molex to 2xPCI Express power connectors, but my PSU didn't have any spare Molex connectors either, so I had to purchase a new PSU to support the video card.

So, after spending an additional $150 total, I was able to play my new $20 game. As for all my other games, they all run at 60fps with all the graphics turned up, so I'm extremely happy with it."

And since I now have a video card capable of player some new-ish games, I went ahead and bought some from Steam. So far the card has had ZERO issues running 2 out of the 3 Witcher games. Only just start the second game in the series, but both this one and the first game ran great on the highest resolution settings. I understand these games are not the most graphic intensive games, but I'm still impressed by the quality of video I get during game play. No noticeable lag, fuzzy images, or weird pixelations.

Frames per second increased by 10 to 15 over my previous graphics card. The fan is very quiet and the graphics card is running much cooler. I could have spent much more on a card meant for gaming but I thought my motherboard;s 760 chipset would be too much of a bottleneck to get decent performance from an expensive video card.

This is a huge pet peeve of mine and it falsely lowers the overall ratings which forces everyone to read between the lines when reading amazon reviews! Reviewers you need a working card to do a proper review and although D.O.A. cards still occur it's part of technology so just accept it and send it back for a new card under the 3 year Asus warranty or Amazons 30 day return/replace policy.
I only buy AMD Radeon video cards because Nvidia really over prices their GPU's, chipsets, and power supplies by at least 30 % and I'm not over paying for video cards no matter who produces them.
I wanted to get a good card that plays well at 1920x1080p and will still play my Military Flight Simulators and F.P.S. games without any issues. The Asus RX 570 was plenty fast enough for gaming and even scored a 71% in 3DMark which is great for a 7 year old system still running a i5 2500k CPU.

I do not over- clock my CPU (But it will run at almost 5 GHZ if I chose to do so since I have a nice closed loop water cooler) I also will never over-clock my GPU because I want stability over speed. Over-clocking really helped out back in the past with the 66 MHZ bus on the intel PII's that ran at 333 MHZ. These hit perfectly on a 100 MHZ bus giving me a rock stable CPU running at 500 MHZ back when intel didn't even have a 400 MHZ CPU on the market!
But that was then and now a days the intel CPU's are being milked for all intel can get while they change their socket sizes so your forced to buy a new board as well.
This Asus RX-570 is well built even though it's fan cover is plastic it's rather light which eliminates sag issues so it's a plus not a negative. I bought it for the double ball bearing fans and 8 gig of DDR5! I waited a year for the prices to get back to normal from all the bitcoin miners and this card is well worth the money and then some. For only $162 this 570 with 8 gig of onboard ram is great value!
I don't recommend using the Asus software that comes with the card since it's very buggy and the Radeon settings can be set just fine without any additional software.

Asus Expedition RX-570_8 GIG video card Update:
I have been using the new card for almost 4 months and it runs great with both Windows 7 Pro and Windows 10 Pro 64 bit O/S's
I recently went back to Win 7 Pro over Win 10 Pro because Win 10 Pro would not run 2 of my favorite Military Sims. Well they would load and I could finish a mission but then the game would crash my system and force me to lose any pilot stats, which ruins the fun of playing realistic flight sims and could have led to some hard restarts that can damage the O/S. I know from personal use that Win 7 Pro 64 bit just runs games better than Windows 10, when it comes to compatibility, and is still a solid Operating System that most gamers still use.
Windows 10 Pro gets bad reviews across the board but I found it to be an excellent O/S with only Linux's latest being more stable and of course free.
O.K. back to the new video card. I can't find any flaws with this card at all. It lacks a black-plate but is really light weight and has a great closed loop heat pipe system, along with the great, real, ball bearing fans, that are so quiet I can't even hear them while I'm gaming. There is zero whine that other cards produce under load and I love that feature.
I only needed a good video card with 4 gig of ram and was looking at a RX-560, but this Asus card and it's 8 gig of DDR5 gave my system and game performance a great boost and was well worth the year long wait not to over pay.

If you need a solid card with quiet fans and like the idea of 8 gig of DDR 5 ram look no further! I have seen a couple of Sapphire cards inthe RX-580 series in July of 2019 priced at only $180 which would have been my first choice if I was buying today. But you can drive yourself crazy if you keep looking at current GPU's prices since the new Radeons are out and getting cheaper all the time. So I always get the best single card for the money and can always buy a second if I upgrade my CPU to a AMD Ryson 1600, my motherboard with a AM4 socket and 16 gig of DDR4 memory.
I priced out this upgrade path and for $450 I can basically get a brand new computer(self built) and add a second Asus RX-570 for Cross-Fire use.
I have bought Sapphire cards in the past and have had good luck with them however, they only have a 2 year warr. and that extra year that Asus offers can be important. I did have a Asus HD 6950 years ago that failed after 2 1/2 years and would have been a paperweight if I didn't have that extra year of warranty as Asus replaced it with no questions asked. I do tend to buy Asus motherboards and video cards since they have good RMA service and a full 3 year warranty on their boards and video cards."

The only way I was successful in getting the fans to run ( When and how I wanted) was by disconnecting the fans to the graphics card and running it to a separate controller. My graphics card now stays between 34-45c even when gaming... Why ohh why would they program their products to run only when it reaches 62c?????????

One obvious reason would be planned obsolescence, by running hotter for longer periods of time it degrades the lifespan exponentially. forcing us ( the consumers ) to purchase their products again and again to boost their sales.

THE FANS HARDLY EVER TURN ON! THIS CARD HEATS UP YOUR CASE & YOUR ROOM!,"Its ama'ing what you can get for $200 I have a bunch of older games that I am using this for at 1440p high detal 165hz monitor with freesync and I'm seeing fram rates at the worse in bordlands the prequal being 40fps in crowed battles and up yo 170fps in less catotic enviroments with an avrage of 80fps

Like when you see those dips I understand why people pay for $400 gpus but if you like indie titles racing games and esports titles which is mostly what I play and a bunch of older AAA Titles I couldt run before this is perfect for me yes more gpu hoprse power would be nice but this defently enough to play on

Side note a gtx 1650 ti would be a better value but this haveing 8gb of vram kinda future proofed it a bit and leaves me room to run mods on games"

Man I really want to love this card because it has such great potential. When it works, it's great. Unfortunately, during gameplay I'm getting random freezes and stuttering on csgo. Usually once or twice a match for like 3-5 seconds. I can't keep using this card, i would say I got a defective unit, but I don't think I did. I hear alot of other people complaining about these cards as well.

Edit: might have network settings issues causing intermittent freezes...still testing other games (valorant, overwatch) and different settings will update again soon.
edit2: nope, just purchased a msi geforce 2060 and csgo runs amazing, no freezes or stuttering.unfortunately, the rx5500 does not do well with go..

Setup: ryzen 5 3600 asus x570"

The 8GB version has the memory for my video production editing and is more than what I need for streaming use and when I do eventually start GAMING. Very quiet operations and I like the monitoring software. Drivers for graphics card are easy to update. No issues at start and is well built. Duel fans keep my unit a cool 30 to 32 degrees C. Was concerned at first about the size of the graphics card as product info says it was more than 12 inches long. Not so with the ASUS duel fan 8GB version. Still plenty of room left in my case. Overall, I'm very pleased!"

Given AMD's recent work mainlining their Linux kernel drivers I opted to go for team red. The GPU is fine but I don't understand why ASUS decided to make this a 2.5 slot card! It is only listed as drawing 140 watts (30 watts less than the dual slot NVIDIA Card that it would be replacing) so there isn't that much heat to dissipate. The added width (plus the rather excessive height) cause problems in a small form factor case. It would have been nice if this description of the card clearly called out that this thing was made far larger then it needed to be.

ASUS SAYS THAT IT IS DAMAGE FROM ME !
2) THE DAMAGE FROM WHERE THE CORDS ARE PLUG IN. I DON'T EVEN OWN SOME OF THOSE CORDS TO PLUG IT !
3) ALL THE DO IS TO REPAIR THEM IS TO GO TO A BIN AND PULL OUT AN USED PART THAT THEY SENT OFF TO SOMEONE TO REPAIR AND EXCHANGE IT THAN TEST IT AND CHARGE FOR A NEW ONE ! AND TAKE THE OLD PART PUT IN AN OUT GOING BIN TO BE SHIPPED TO A REPAIR SERVICE SOME WHERE ELSE ! I WILL NEVER BUY ASUS PROCT AGAIN ! AND ON RETURNING NY CARD THEY SAID IT MIGHT NO BE PUT TOGETHER ! I SENT IT ALL TOGETHER, I EXPECT IT TO BE RETURNED ALL TOGETHER ! I WON'T PAY FOR REPAIRNIG AT THE PRICE OF BUYING A NEW ONE !"

I personally managed to overclock it to 2.2ghz and it was super stable. It does run warm so make sure you have good case ventilation. Another this about it is that it runs extremely quiet, fans turn on at 60°C are are barely audible."

Was looking forward to using this card but now I'll need to order the cable, wait for it, reopen and start over with the install. How good is the performance? Who knows?"

I had a hard time setting it up but not because of the card. My system made it difficult. It is up and working just fine now, delivering all those gaming FPS that I was hoping for. Being able to upgrade my 1080p video is nice too. Especially for the cost. It is worth it."

Doing research it is a common issue for AMD drivers and there is no fix or work around. I'm going back to Nvida.

It is a little large of a card so make sure your case has space for it and if not...GET A NEW CASE :D

Packaged perfectly and even shipped to me a week before expected!

Pictures I supplied are showing just how well it was boxed and the one with an Xbox controller is to give a size reference."
