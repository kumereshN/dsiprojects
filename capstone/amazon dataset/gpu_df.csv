"XFX Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition 1386MHz OC+, 8GB GDDR5, VR Ready, Dual BIOS, 3xDP HDMI DVI, AMD Graphics Card (RX-580P8DFD6)",AMD,$221.11,,Almost fried my whole computer,"After about 2 months of having this card, it had fried itself. I was playing fallout when my computer crashed and upon trying to start it up, my USB keyboard and mouse would get power for their LED's but the computer would not start, no fans would spin. A few days later I tried it again to which sparks shot out of my video card. It would have likely fried my whole computer if I hadn't unplugged my power strip from the wall. I later tried another video card that a friend gave me to which I downloaded the drivers for and it worked pretty much fine. Very disappointed in this product as it nearly ruined my entire computer."

Confirmed on TWO copies of this card (I bought one, it started doing it, exchanged the card for another, same exact issues).

The card does use more power than an nvidia card with similar specs and also creates more heat. But at the same time value for the spec is great. As a product I would give it 4 stars however, XFX's warranty service is surprisingly easy and fast. My card broke after a year of use, so I registered the product on their site, I received a response within 24 hours. They troubleshooted and determined the card needs to be RMAed, I sent the card back and I received a new one within a week after they received the defective card. They didn't even require the receipt(required by most companies) even though I had it. It's amazing service compare to my PNY nvidia experience which was like pulling teeth. I will definitely buy more XFX products in the future."

Then, I started encountering problems with their drivers. Fine, rolled back my driver to an older version. Then, my GTX 970 stopped working after only 1 year of use. Fine, sent it in and received a refurbished one. The refurbished one now has the same issue.

Bought the XFX GTS RX 580 8GB DDR5. 0 driver issues. Card still works after a few months and puts out a better picture then my 970. I'll update my review if something goes wrong but, for now, I'm extremely pleased with this card both in terms of performance and price. I'll be all to happy to continue buying AMD in future."

The fans do not spin at all unless you are over 60 degree celsius so don't panic it is not a defective card it just has a 0 db mode for noise. Very sleek with a very nice design.

1: This is a fairly large GPU, if you don't have a Full Tower, or an opened-air mobo, your mileage with fitting this thing in a Mid Tower WILL differ

2: My old GPU require two 6-pin, while this GPU required one 8-pin, you will either need an 8-pin or a 6+2 pin to connect your power supply to your GPU, if you don't have a powersupply that you modify, well you will need a new one.

3: For the price, this GPU is very strong, even if it is only a rehash of the 480... and being a year old. It can still run newer titles like Monster Hunter: World without too many problems.

4: Price-wise, having to compete with cryto-miners may increase the price of this GPU from time to time... very annoying.

5: This is a major update from my old HD 7950 (which still works for many games that are moderately intense and are new.)"

The first one wouldn't work at all, the second one worked for less than two months. When it was working, it was beautiful but it has to work. I will never again buy an XFX product.

I've spent about 6 hours trying to troubleshoot this card. So far I've not gotten it to work once. System POSTs, windows sounds tell me that windows is booting, but I NEVER get any video. Forced driver installation overtop old graphics card and reset with new driver. Still nothing. This isn't my first graphics card installation, and I've never had one go this poorly. Did I get a dud?

EDIT: The first one never did work, but the replacement worked fine. Had to purchase a new Power Supply to get full use out of it. Perhaps I have a needy system but 500W wasn't enough to get it running at max efficiency. What I will say is that, now that I have it running properly, the picture is GORGEOUS. Absolutely love it.

EDIT 12/12/2018 - So my saga of the XFX Radeon RX 580 has come to an end. I am returning the card after some very helpful product support from Amazon worked through diagnosing issues on the second card, which replaced the one that wouldn't work from the start. I had the card installed for about 40-45 days before it cut out in the middle of playing a game one night. The system wouldn't even post, so I thought it might be an issue with the motherboard or the power supply which I had purchased to power this card. During diagnostics, it turns out it was the video card, which I learned was indicating a defective card. (Genuine thanks to Amazon Product Support!) It was preventing the system from even POSTing.

This card is headed to UPS today and I will never again purchase an XFX product. I can be pretty forgiving and recognize that sometimes flawed products make it through. This, however, is indicative to me of a larger issue."

At 2560x1080 ultrawide, it slays the games I play. GTA 5 and Fallout 4 nearly max out (sometimes have to trade shadow quality for SSAA or vice-versa depending on preferences) and I have absolutely no problem maintaining 60fps with 70Â°c or below while playing them. I will be testing more titles but if you are below 1440p this card should be able to play anything at medium settings or above incl. new titles. I have it at 1384MHz with a custom fancurve to keep temps in check (this fan really isn't very loud at 50% or below anyways; I had to put my m.2 under the GPU which makes me a little nervous so I'd rather have the area as actively cooled as possible) but it does in fact sit at 0rpm unless you're gaming which is very nice. I'd recommend this card for any gaming under 1440p or even at 1440p lower-mid settings depending on the games you prefer; it seems very reliable so far and the 8gb vram is nice; having high-res textures in games is super nice, and I've had no problems; I'd recommend this over the 1060 6gb unless you can get one for $230 or less.

Update: Pushing memclocks to 2250 in wattman will squeeze a few extra frames out of furmark and so far seems stable on my card. Increasing clockspeeds actually made performance slightly worse for furmark likely due to it causing throttling, so I actually have the core at 1350MHz and the mem at 2250MHz now, running a little better than stock.

Edit 8 months later: I had IMC issues with Ryzen 5 2600 and tried rma this card thinking it was at fault because I had BSODs and CTDs while gaming. Ended up replacing the CPU and found out it was not the gpu. However playing far cry at 1080 ultra for 45 min caused the gpu to crap out. No Mobo would post with it installed. I have reached out to their support and hope to hear back. Last time they were prompt but I did assemble and reassemble the gpu with new tm (to no avail) which technically voids warranty. If they don't hold up on warranty that's my fault but if so I'll be ecstatic. Good experience mostly but too bad multiple faulty parts have left me with a great PC becoming useless.

2020: Laaaate update - XFX straight up sent me a brand new retail card many months ago and have had no issues since. RMA is very good in the US."

Strange noise. The VRAM may be bad.,"Purchased this cause it's on sale. Heard XFX before but never tried. Worst experience ever. The first photo is My old RX 560 Compare to this card. thought this may be a better option, but I was wrong. The card was good when I got it after I installed the windows, everything seems good until Log into the windows, the screen goes dark. Thought sth wrong with other stuff. After tried some diagnosis, I found the graphics card is the reason. The 2nd and 3rd photos are my new PC and old PC. I moved my RX 560 into the new PC, no problem at all. I also tried to move the RX 580 to the old one. SAME ISSUE. It just reboots before went to the windows. Going to return this one and buy MSI or Sapphire. Don't ever try XFX.

Ever.,"I have bought two of these, and I recently found out that if you try to run any game, or indeed any 3d application, at > 1080p@60Hz, the cards will most likely become unstable. Sometimes this crashes the entire system, sometimes it's just a momentary black screen, sometimes it's a permanent black screen, and sometimes it's just a flicker.

In any case, this card is not worth your hard earned money. Stay away from it. I would be returning both if they weren't out of the return window."
"XFX Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition 1386MHz OC+, 8GB GDDR5, VR Ready, Dual BIOS, 3xDP HDMI DVI, AMD Graphics Card (RX-580P8DFD6)",AMD,$221.11,,If you experience black screens or flickering while gaming...,"When gaming at 4k @ 60hz over HDMI, your display may flicker as if being disconnected and reconnected. After many hours of troubleshooting the obvious (swapping cables, reinstalling, etc) it is narrowed down to a lack of bandwidth or too much noise on the HDMI port.

It seems that the drivers detect the display and set the color space to 4:4:4, which in my experience is unstable on this card on any display. Under this setting, it's impossible to game because the screen blanks out every couple seconds. I've tried a dozen different cables with no improvement, even a cable known to work perfectly at 4k 60hz on Xbox One X.

My running theory is that the port itself can't handle the required 18gbps bandwidth that 4:4:4 4k 60hz requires, and/or the card produces enough electrical noise (under load) that it bleeds into the port causing the display to re-handshake repeatedly.

Switching to displayport works fine, but if you're stuck on HDMI 2.0, this should help:

Change the color format to 4:2:0 in Radeon display settings. 4:2:2 is also unstable for me.

Or

Disable HDMI 2.0 and live with no more than 30hz"

However, after about a month of gaming at stock speeds/no overclocking, card died. Installed in custom built gaming system for my son with plenty of power and cooling. After the card failed, I did extensive troubleshooting. Took a while to narrow it down to the video card. Any system I put this card into wouldn't even power on. Normally a system with a dead video card will power up but, beep or black screen etc. however, with this card NOTHING (Must have a serious short or something).

No overclocking, actually I turned the clock speed down to keep in step with the heat and turned the fans on earlier and to higher speed with the AMD tuner software. I have large tower with plenty of of intake and exhaust fans and my chipset temperature is 33 Celsius on idle, so it's not my system. Also my older card doesn't have this problem. This card- just simply gave up on a pause screen for 1 minute, playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. The fans were spinning but nothing seems to help this card in control.
I have to say this isn't the first ATI card doing this to me, but at least my previous RX 480 was stable, although it was running a bit hot. My previous GFX card was a GTX 980 and runs without a hiccup, no overheating no issues whatsoever, what I needed is more RAM, my GTX had only 4, and some games today won't even try to load the textures for high/very high settings if the game doesn't detects at least 6GB of RAM.
What happens is, the game (any game using 3D engine apparently) runs ok for about 5-10 minutes and then the monitor suddenly goes to sleep for about 2 seconds, and then it comes up. It will keep repeating this until I turn off the game. Also the fans are way too loud on this. Even with not so demanding games, games that were made 3-4yrs ago, the fans kick in and run loud like it's struggling to keep the heat down, even though an on-board graphics from Intel or AMD could run those games with no issues.
I only got this card, because I built a whole new AMD system,
Ryzen 2600 CPU
16GB RAM
480GB SSD +1TB HD
*(prevously GTX 980)
I literally tried all settings on both the card, the monitor, my PC, even fresh installation of Win10, then card driver cleaning, replacing fans in my pc case, adding more, buying new diplayport cables, trying HDMI cables, nothing fixes it.
I have an LG Ultrawide with FreeSync monitor)
Looks like I'm putting back my old card now, realizing I'm not the only one with this issue, I'm out of the time bracket to return it, so just be aware, there is a reason why this card is so cheap."
"XFX Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition 1386MHz OC+, 8GB GDDR5, VR Ready, Dual BIOS, 3xDP HDMI DVI, AMD Graphics Card (RX-580P8DFD6)",AMD,$221.11,,You get what you pay for,"So far so good.

I got the xfx Rx 580 GTA 1386mhz last Wednesday 9-19-18 and man my old reference rx480 definitely had power draw problems. I knew something was amuck but couldn't prove it.

Day 1. Installed and ran firestrike. My old graphics score was beat by 200 points higher by this card.

Day 2. Opened up doom and barely got below 85 fps in 1080p. Even battlefront 2 had better performance for me. I think it was 75+ fps (I have an i7 4790 non k and regretting not getting the k)

Day 3. card runs beautiful I played some online doom and didn't have any lag or low fps as expected.

I'm now on day 5. And not regretting buying this card. I even overclocked it to 1450mhz and 2050 on VRAM and it doesn't give me a hitch or any issues!

Day 19
I have no problems with the card. It handles everything I throw at it! Even squad. I have to use a bunch of medium settings due to amds compatibility, but I get 60fps.on most areas with my i7 4790."
"XFX Radeon RX 580 GTS XXX Edition 1386MHz OC+, 8GB GDDR5, VR Ready, Dual BIOS, 3xDP HDMI DVI, AMD Graphics Card (RX-580P8DFD6)",AMD,$221.11,,"Great for 4K/30 - 1080p/60 Gaming, and a steal if you want/sell the $120 bundled games!","I have had this GPU for about a week, and I've been really happy with it. While running at stock settings, the card runs relatively cool and quiet. My card overclocked pretty well, and I'm able to get an additional 10% of performance at the expense of higher temps and louder fans. At stock settings, the GPU stays below 70c at load, and up to 82c with my current overclock. I'm able to run the new Resident Evil 2 with Max settings at a locked 1080p/60 with ease. I am also able to run a locked 4K/30 in RE2 with no drops in performance. Many older games are able to run at resolutions up to 4K/60, and many modern games are even good at 1440p/60.

AMD's software is leaps and bounds above what I remember from the Catalyst Software days. I remember having driver problems which cause sound problems over HDMI when I had an HD 7870. I also had problems with the Crimson Drivers in an RX 480 build I did for a friend a couple years back. In that build, I had to loan him one of my GTX cards for a few months because his RX 480 was unusable due to a driver issue that caused the screen to flicker black. After a driver update, the GPU finally worked for him. I have had no issues with my RX 580, and the only crashes I've had are from pushing my overclock slightly too far. After dialing my OC back, I have run it for hours straight with 82c temps without a hitch.

Now the best part, I basically got this card for $85 thanks to the bundled games. I planned on waiting for AMD's new cards later this year, but I had a friend who told me he was getting Resident Evil 2 and The Division 2 when they released. I asked him if he would be willing to buy the codes from me to help lower the cost of a new GPU, and he agreed. So after tax, my $205 (including tax) RX 580 became an $85 steal after selling the bundled games to my friend for $120. If you know someone wanting to buy both games, or you intend on getting 2 of the 3 games, I believe this card is a no-brainer. You can easily sell the card for over $85 over the next couple of years if you decide you want to upgrade to something faster.

Keep in mind, claiming the free games requires a bit of effort, and it would be hard to sell the free games to anyone you don't know. Basically, I had to create an AMD rewards account to claim the games. The account has to detect the GPU installed in your system to claim the free games, so you can't simply sell the AMD key to someone else. Once the AMD activation site confirms your hardware, it allows you to choose 2 out of the 3 games available: Resident Evil 2, The Division 2, and Devil May Cry 5. Once those games are chosen, then the AMD account has to be tied to your Steam account to activate the game to the steam library. Again, it works with a willing friend, but it will be difficult to do if you plan on selling the keys to someone you don't know well.

All in all, I am really happy with this purchase. If crossfire was still worth using these days, I would buy another one and keep the bundled games for myself. It's that good of a deal.

A final thought, if you are interested in all 3 of the bundled games, the RX 590, Vega 56, Vega 64, and the upcoming Radeon VII come with all 3 games: effectively lowering the cost of those GPU's a staggering $180! If my friend could have waited a couple of weeks to play RE2, I would have waited for the Radeon VII's release. But he couldn't wait, and I'm still very satisfied that I jumped on a great deal!"

The card itself works well, to reassure anybody who might be on the fence or needs a video card as soon as possible. A replacement card for my now dead 970 from newegg arrived DoA (One of those 100 buck sapphire 470s), so, out of panic, knowing that my RMA would probably take something along the line of two weeks, I snatched one of these bad boys up at a small premium compared to the offers on other sites. It arrived swift, as per usual, and it plugged in and got working right away. Honestly, I love it, i'd say its right on par with my old 970 at a very agreeable price. To anyone who hasn't looked at in depth performance reviews, one of these cards is able to handle pretty much every recent game, except overly resource-hungry modern titles, at a comfortable 40-60+ fps depending on the setting of your choice and whether or not you add additional shaders. Coming from anything below a 970, whether it be an r9 series, 7xx, radeon xxxx, you should be rather satisfied with one of these cards. I recommend them especially at this price point. I'm not sure if it's posted anywhere on this product page or brought to attention well enough, but you do get a selection of two out of three games coming out soon, so assuming you're interested in the division 2, DMC5, or resident evil 2, this could potentially be a very smart move so you don't have to purchase those any more.

Small(large) edit: So, apparently I thought I was having issues with this thing once I switched to a 1440p monitor; however, there is a pretty gigantic quirk that I thought might bring light so some common complications with this card. This card is best for 1080p gaming, period. However, with 1440p it can work, but there is a bit of a complication with how AMD gpus tend to work in general lately, especially the Polaris line, which this card belongs to. You may notice that sometimes under intense load that your screen might flicker. This brought me no end of annoyance at first, but I discovered that you basically have to go into global settings (under ""Gaming"") with radeon's software and tab into wattman to do some editing. At the bare minimum, without any other adjustments, you need to adjust the power limit on this card to around +20%~ or more if it has to do any heavy lifting, otherwise it will throttle one way or another with differing symptoms. Amd has thrown out a bunch of efficiency software and tuning which end up under powering your card where it may need it in desperate times. This isn't overclocking, but this does actually allow for proper overclocking, if you don't wish to proceed any further than this, you don't need to. I'm not sure why they thought it would be wise to essentially choke this thing for power right out of the box, but it seems to be a reality. My card works as it should now 1440p, but do monitor temperatures with HW monitor, and adjust the fan speed curve as need be, just to be certain (My case has awful airflow). Wattman can be a fantastic utility, so utilize it!

Just be sure you have enough power to back the card up, I do fine @ 550W and an i5 6600k, but you should plan out your power usage just as a precaution. Knowledge is power!"

I had a decent price and a nice bump in graphics over my previous older card. But about 5 months after I got it we started having these system hang/crashes where the whole screen goes dark. The system was still on and had to be hard powered off to get it back up. This only happened during GPU heavy games needing to take the card above 50% capacity.

We tried to reinstall drives, reseat the card, reformat the OS, then adjust the settings. All of these failed to resolve the issue. We then thought it might be related to the CPU or its heatsinks so we put in a new motherboard, memory, and CPU. This also had no effect, so I go looking for this issue and low and behold I am not the first person to have this problem. So now we are getting a new card from a new company and not cheeping out on the price.

You can overclock this card, but out of the box, it blows the walls out, no real need for minor performance uptick on overclocking.
I have overclocked one of these in tests in gaming, didn't really see a difference, maybe 5-10 better frames, but stock it was already getting 80f on Overwatch. Not much better performance on 4k video editing while overclocking, don't really see a need. I play on HUGE maps, sandbox, galaxy, ect, no issues.

Here are several reasons why I picked this card instead of something more powerful:
- It is relatively inexpensive.
- It is low profile and occupies only one PCI slot. This is important since my PC has a SFF (small form factor) case with limited space.
- It consumes very little power (20W max), so even the 220W power supply in my PC can handle it.
- It uses only heatsink for passive cooling. This eliminates the noise and reliability problems associated with cooling fans.

- Initially right after the graphic card was installed, I can only get a display of 1200x800 from the HDMI port. Nothing from VGA port.
- After I installed the MSI VGA Drivers from disc, my monitor can now display 1920x1080 from VGA port, but nothing from HDMI port.

The problem could be from my computer's motherboard, since I observed the same behavior with the "

Just keep this behavior in mind, in case you cannot see any display right after installing the card.

[Graphic Performance]
I ran the 3DMARK 'Cloud Gate' benchmark on my PC, both before and after the graphic card upgrade:
- With integrated graphic, the overall score is a pathetic 209.
- After installing the GT 710, the score jumps up to 3735!

That means the graphic card consumes 15-20W when it is running at full speed.

After I played XCOM for several hours, the heatsink becomes too hot to touch, but not hot enough to cause a shutdown. In contrast, the EVGA GeForce 210 suffers thermal shudown after just ~10-20 minutes of playing XCOM. This is because the 210 consumes more power (30W vs. 20W) but comes with a smaller heatsink.

[Conclusion]
The GT 710 works very well in my particular situation. Of cause this is an inexpensive entry-level card, so I cannot expect the same level of performance as my GeForce GTX 750 Ti. But for a very small investment, I'm suddenly able to play many games which were previously unplayable on my old SFF PC. For that I'm happy."

I was looking for a way to boost the performance of an old Gateway SX2801-01e, thin profile desktop. It was maxed out on RAM (8 GB), but for whatever reason, just couldn't seem to generate graphics smoothly and without struggling. Not gaming, mind you, but for place-shifting and streaming video, and having multiple applications open. This card fit in the sole expansion slot for a PCI x16 card. My main concern was that the dated BIOS would be too ancient, or that the card would simply freeze up the computer. Neither happened. It booted into low-resolution at first while the drivers updated automatically. But after the updates and a couple of reboots, I was back in business. This old desktop has new life, as it runs like a new computer. (I had already migrated to a Samsung SSD and added a USB 3.0 card.) The built-in 2GB or RAM is supremely helpful. I'm also running with a 220W power supply, and not the recommended 300W without issues. It consumes a mere 19W. I'm going to upgrade my older monitor with a higher-resolution one now that the graphics card can support it."

Instructions are not included for installing the low profile bracket. What you do:
Use a pair of needle nose pliers and unscrew the long bracket by twisting the little bolts that you woudl normally screw the video cable into. Just pinch the sides of each bolt and give little short twists (lefty loosey) until it comes loose, keep track of your bolts, and then once all four are out, you can easily separate the VGA socket (at the top in the main picture). The included short profile brackets are pretty obvious for placement, just watch the orientation. You'll end up using two of your external slots, but only the one PCI slot on the motherboard. The little bolts screw back in to the new brackets, and it's just fast and simple. I don't even think I ended up using a screwdriver at all, but the case we have was pretty much made for fast, painless installation without tools. The pliers are a must, though.

While this does say it requires a 300w power supply, it's running absolutely fine on a 240w power supply. Didn't even have to plug it in to a separate power cable (which is good, because there wasn't one.) We're using it for older Steam games (Spore, for example) for my kid, on a Windows 7 machine we bought for $250, and this upgrade brings the machine pretty painlessly up to a decent standard for a lot of games. Just don't try to max your graphics out, because you don't want to overheat a fanless card.

Anyway, I'm pleased. Oh, and everything comes packaged with little red caps over the connectors, which makes handling it a lot less nerve wracking while you're figuring the brackets out. A card I can hold easily while dicking around with the bracket? Thank you! They recommend using rubber gloves to avoid nicks, and I didn't, but this still may be the first time I've installed a video card when I didn't end up bleeding."

There was originally only 4GB of RAM on the machine and integrated graphics. It would not even play Fortnite. After adding the graphics card it would play but did lag or would even crash some times. I then upgraded the RAM with an additional 8GB (4GB x 2 sticks) for a total of 12GB. Now he says it plays pretty smooth with no lagging or crashing. He does have the resolution turned down to the lowest setting. It's a $45 card and that's what I would expect, but I don't think he tried to turn it up since adding the RAM. He wasn't looking to build a gaming rig and just needed a better graphics card over what was integrated.

Great for business use!,"MSI is one of my go-to graphics card companies. Their quality is great, their cards perform well and their Afterburner software is second to none.

Let's be up front about one thing here: a GT 710 is a GT 710. If you're looking for a gaming card, even just to play Windows Store games, look to at least a 730 or, better, a 750 Ti for entry level gaming.

With that behind us, let's talk about reasonable expectations for a 710. The purpose of a 710 is to give an old computer with no digital video output an HDMI jack. It's to beef up a PC with vintage 2006 integrated graphics and allow it to work with modern displays. It's my expectation that if a graphics card supports a given resolution, be that 1080p, 1440p or even 4k, that it will be capable of smooth video playback at that resolution. I chose this 710 for my HTPC because it supports 4k resolution, and I just needed my ancient PC to push 4k video. That's it.

And here's where this card failed me. 4k video playback was subpar. It was choppy, the HDMI audio cut in and out, and it wasn't just one source. YouTube, local content, it all looked bad. 1080p was much better, but the 4K display did it no favors.

The 710's saving grace was that it was able to push convincing 1080p video to a 1080p monitor, and maybe that's really all it's useful for. If that's your use case, and for plenty of people I'm sure it is, this is a decent, cheap card for you.

Mine was returned. I didn't even bother goofing around with overclocking or temperature testing because I just didn't see a need to. The 710 clearly wasn't quite enough for my needs."

It replaced old ATI HD 4600 series graphics cards which developed issues with dual monitor with the original Windows 10 creators Update and new blue screen issues with the Fall Creators Update. While ATI stopped supporting their product in 2015, Nvidia still releases a solid set of drivers that support the latest version of Windows 10. This MSI version of the GT 710 is very flexible. It supports both low profile (2 slots with brackets included), and standard profile (only 1 slot needed), and is cable of driving 2 HD monitors with ease. Compared to the HD 4650 it was replaced with, the 2d images and text see clearer and the colors more vibrant, even on 15 year old monitors running analog. Even though this is not a gaming card, it holds its own for the light to casual gamer and does not need a lot of power from the PSU to do so."
MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 OpenGL 4.5 Single Fan Low Profile Graphics Card (GT 710 2GD3 LP),Nvidia,$51.99,,So far so good but....,"Inexpensive for a brand new video card. Solid DXVA capabilities for an HTPC. Worked great to replace a dying 7600GS in my dad's computer. Very low power.

Passive cooling might not be enough for this card if you task it alot and have a case with very low airflow. My dad's small form factor PC saw it running in the 80s celsius just running some light games. I attached a slim low-noise 40mm fan to it with a ziptie and that was easily enough to cool it down. Now it never gets above 60*C when playing games for hours. So be aware the cooler is just too small to be a good passive cooler for games and DXVA in a super tight case. In a case with better airflow this is probably less of an issue.

It's paired with a C2D E7500 Wolfdale 2.93Ghz and 8GB DDR-2 800 RAM so not an amazing PC but enough to push this card along well enough. It runs Youtube, Netflix and Media Player Classic with 1080p mkvs smoothly. It has HDMI output which makes it good for our occasional HTPC needs. Again the card does DXVA okay, but not amazingly. Combined with the CPU it's more than enough to handle high bitrate 1080p which is the goal. So for that it's pretty useful despite the low performance. Better at DXVA than the 7600GS by a longshot.

Modern features but very weak performance. Runs older games somewhat worse than the ancient 7600GS it replaced, and newer games just a little better. This card isn't intended for games, but it would be nice to see it perform more like its specs. It's not as disastrous as the GT210 was, with simply broken performance, but it's pretty weak.

That said, it runs Source games okay with the settings scaled back, and runs Battlefield 1942, Call of Duty/UO and lots of other popular older games. My dad uses it to play Rome Total War and Medieval 2 nearly cranked which makes him happy. Runs most lighter-weight newer games with low settings as well. So it's not totally helpless, but it's not meant to compete as a gaming card. AMD's APUs are much faster than this, and the integrated in newer Intel CPUs is also much faster. For my dad's older PC though, this MSI GT710 was a perfectly reasonable replacement part."

But It can keep up with maybe 80% of my steam library, which has lots of games pre-2016. Just don't expect to do some seriously high-end gaming and you're probably fine. Always check the game's specs and if a card is still in support when looking for what you need.

It was A BUTT to get the screws out to install it into the case because they were in so tight, but everything else about the install went smoothly. We have an HD monitor, and everything looks great. Supports the sound to said monitor as well. NVIDIA drivers are fantastic because they let you know when there's an update unobtrusively and they're very simple to install. Just a few clicks and 1-2 screen flashes and you're done. Supports dual monitors.

This went into a half-tower with an offensively small power supply (300w) so I had to unplug the blu-ray drive but it is working fantastically. For the price, I really have no complaints. It's been working great, and since the card is still in support, you'll continue to get drivers so your games don't crash suddenly. Or cook itself to death, like the card it replaced."

RMA'd the card. Was quickly repaired and sent back to me via Fedex (less then 2 weeks). However MSI didn't bother to ask me if it needed any special instructions return shipping, so it didn't bother to tell Fedex to make sure I signed for it. Fedex said they delivered it (to my door) so I am 100% certain it was stolen (for my neighborhood, thats a big fat DUH). MSI says its not their fault, and that if I had wanted it signed for I should have called and said so. One guy told me that they don't automatically tell Fedex to make sure its signed for because it costs them more to ship it that way.

In short. too bad, your screwed, we didn't follow up on getting proper shipping instructions or even bother to ASK YOU if we should. Its your fault it got stolen, deal with it.

For some reason, my old video card stopped outputting 3840x2160 @ 30Hz (30 frames/sec), and went back down to 1080p. Because my monitor at the office is 3840x2160, that meant I only had 1/4 as much space for windows, and my productivity was hurting.
My old card, a Radeon HD 5450, required that I use drivers from 2012 to let me drive that video timing out on HDMI. But one fateful day, even the old drivers refused to send it, with no explanation as to why. I also had to rig up a little device to keep the HPD (Hot Plug Detect) signal from going away when I turned my monitor off, or the Radeon would switch to the DVI output. Every. Single. Time. It was really frustrating.
So I went and got this, because I was just looking for a card with the following:
- It outputs 3840x2160 @ 30Hz on HDMI
- It's silent
- Low power
I did about 5 minutes of research, found this, verified on nVidia's website that it would do it (it's spelled out that it will), and whipped out my credit card and hit ""Order Now."" I ordered it on Thursday, and Amazon had it to me on Friday (even though it was normal Prime 2-day shipping). Bonus.
So I crack open my mid-tower, find the old card covered in dust (but it was also a fanless card, and the dust blew right off, no probs), and slap this in. The driver install took ages (gotta have all of those patches and tweaks for games I won't be playing...) and eventually I was back up and running. With this card, 3840x2160 showed up, and was marked as preferred. And when I turn off my monitor and turn it back on again later, it didn't switch to DVI because it decided to. Excellent.
To summarize:
- Works with 2016 drivers in 4K, unlike some other budget cards
- Doesn't decide spontaneously to switch to DVI from HDMI
- I'm happy with it"

It is not and should not be marketed as a ""gaming"" card. I have a ~2015 Dell Optiplex that has a half-height form factor that I use at my work. The motherboard on the Dell only supports a single VGA output and I really prefer a dual-monitor setup for productivity. I had an old XFX-branded Radeon HD5450 in the case that was doing dual-monitor duty just fine for all this time running Windows 7. When Windows 7 support ended my computer had to be reformatted and a fresh Windows 10 install was done with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled. What we discovered was the BIOS/UEFI changes that were necessary were incompatible with the old Radeon card.

I picked up this GT 710 for a very specific use case. It had to be small-form factor (low-profile brackets), had to be low-power and passively cooled, able to support multiple monitors outputs, and had to support UEFI. This MSi card fit all the criteria. It comes with the standard bracket installed but took a matter of minutes to put the 2 included low-profile brackets on with the correct tools. I installed it in the computer very easily but I was surprised that the card only took up about half of a PCI-e slot. The physical length of the card only occupies the first half of the slot and it doesn't even engage the PCI-e locking mechanism. Once the card is bolted down it doesn't move.

It booted fine and worked for me without any additional drivers. The Nvidia control panel was even added by Windows without any user intervention. I'm running the card with the stock power supply and running two 1080p monitors, one on HDMI and one with DVI-D. So far so good."

This one runs about 95 F. I didn't buy this card for gaming just wanted a decent card to run in my old Dell Optiplex desktop. I don't need the low profile adapters. Mine isn't a small form factor.

I purchased this card knowing it was low-profile, which was good. It fit right into the case and snapped in without issue. No need to connect anything beyond that and the whole process took 5 minutes.

The card ships with a driver CD. I installed the drivers and the additional software on the CD but ended up removing the additional software as it related to overclocking and I didn't need it.

I like this card as it costs less than fifty bucks and boosts the overall video performance of PCs with integrated graphics. This 2GB card is better than most of the 1GB cards at around the same price point and provides users with the option to have a dual monitor setup.

UPDATE 12/17/2019:
I just picked up a new HDTV, the Samsung 43"" model UN43NU6900BXZA which offers 4K and UHD. Amazon carries it as does Bestbuy and others locally. It may be a baseline model, but, wow, the pic quality is extremely crisp and clean. The MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB is working perfectly with my new 4K Samsung, using my Mac Pro running Mojave.

This card supports 4K and there was no adjustments in settings needed for setup, the card and my 4K Samsung communicated perfectly and my Mac Pro make the resolution settngs seamlessly in the background upon connecting.
The quality of my Mac Pro now (running Mojave for the present) is stellar. Details, fine text, screen fit, contrast, color...etc...it all looks superb.

If you are considering a 4K display upgrade, YES, this card will work perfectly with it!
---------------------------
I needed an inexpensive card to upgrade my Mac Pro 5.1 mid-2012 and this card works perfectly for that. No power cable needed and a very small profile that won't get in the way of other cards and slots. It is self powered by the PCIe bus so no power cable was needed.

Of course there is no boot screen during boot nor a way to select which drive to boot from if you have more than one OS drive. You can easily though, change the ""start-up"" drive once the OS is booted and loaded in System Preferences, so not a big deal for me.

I am using the HDMI output to a Samsung 1080 HDTV and there was no need to tweak screen fit or anything. The card booted right up to a perfect screen display.

I've tried a few other Apple recommended cards in the past and honestly, none did any better than this. I returned one at over $150 simply because I decided to wait for a lower priced card to do the same thing and this MSI card does! Additionally, this card seems to wake my Mac out of sleep very quickly. The older cards I tried seemed very sluggish to do that, this card seems much more responsive to wake my Mac. A Win-Win in here!

HMDI won't pass the audio, but, no cards out there will do that unless specifically made for a Mac Pro and flashed correctly. I have optical and digital output on my M. Pro so not a biggie.

The card seems responsive and fast and at some point I will do a ""Geekbench"" test. The 1080 on my Samsung HDTV looks crisp and clear output from this card. I would say 1080 looks slightly better on this card than my old OEM one that came installed on my Mac. Small icon seems a bit crisper and clearer. Close to the old card, but, there is definitely a bit of improvement there.

The card is fan cooled and since I won't be gaming with this desktop, it should run very cool routinely.

5 Stars all around and a great way to upgrade an older Mac Pro on the cheap."

Had one of my computer wires snag the card initially, but was easily held out of way so the card would fit in slot on motherboard. * Installation videos were spot on providing valuable information. * Love the protective caps provided for shipping and also able to be used after installation to keep dust out of unused monitor outs

Dislikes: * The Heatsink card has slightly slower specs than the fan cooled card. I can live with less specs as heat and noise are major concerns of mine.

Yes I'd buy this card again and recommend to a friend or relative.

MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 OpenGL 4.5 Single Fan Low Profile Graphics Card (GT 710 2GD3 LP),Nvidia,$51.99,,MSI - Making a name for themselves! Best 5600 on the market at this time.,"Normally, I'm not a big fan of MSI, but took a chance after reading reviews. I built a new system to replace my 10 year old HP, that's still working, but wanted something a bit faster. It's my everyday, all day computer that doesn't do a lot of power intensive projects. I have a separate graphics computer as my monster computer. Blah, blah, blah. The card is really small, and that's good. More heat sync and fan than anything. Fired right up and delivers a nice clean picture. So I'm happy. I got what I wanted and looking for at a fair price. So far, I would recommend."

When I first purchased this in early March 2020, it was extremely unstable because of the well known AMD driver issues which caused constant black screens among thousands of people. I was SO SO close to returning this thing because I had to endure these issues for a month asking myself ""Did I really just spend $300 on this piece of junk??"" Thankfully I hung in there for just a tad bit longer. Mid March I flashed the new VBIOS using MSI Live Updates and the black screens weren't as constant, but the issues still remained. Finally AMD released a new driver update mid March version 20.3.1 which seemed to fix the black screens and also addressed the known issues in the ""What's new"" portion of the driver update info.

Conclusion:

This is a 1080p killing machine! Great value for the money and can stand toe-to-toe against RTX 2060 Super but for about $100 less. Make sure to flash new VBIOS using MSI LIVE Updates and update to latest AMD drivers for RX 5600 XT."

- Very affordable and accurately priced @ > $300
- Very cool gpu. Stress tests with Kombuster/Userbenchmark couldn't push the gpu above 80c before OC crash.
- Adrenalin software is interesting/Very customizable with current updates (is finally stable)
- Freesync (significantly easier to find a nice monitor for this gpu as most monitors now have freesync)
- Lots of room for over clocking and pretty damn stable compared to Nvidia
- FPS is *pretty good for the price

Cons

- Very sharp/ grainy graphical style. (NVIDIA is known for being smooth and silky while this card is grainy and sharp in most games. This is not a bad thing if you're looking for the best FPS, but i try to build systems that look amazing and function amazing. This card is more of the side of ""function amazing"")
- Gets crushed by the 2060 super and fairly out done by the 2060. This is a half step down from the 2060 in my book.
- Time consuming for new PC builders to get settings dialed in. I've spent probably 4-5 hours getting this card dialed in - running DDU, driver updates, general card settings in adrenaline, monitor configuration etc. Much more tweaking needed compared to an NVIDIA card buy after everything is all said and done, i like the customization this card offers.
- Not particularly amazing but a good card. Can't run warzone on max settings without a lot of performance chopping, WoW at max settings performs around 65-75 fps. Was a little disappointed at first. HOWEVER on more customized graphics/settings in adrenalin you can push the image quality down and get significantly higher performance.

OVERALL (TLDR) - I'd give this card a 7/10 for value alone. Don't expect this card to handle everything you throw at it, but do expect this card to put up pretty good performance in most scenarios."

The evga 2060 was 350 while this one is 290. I saw some YouTube videos that said this is the best card for 1080 p gaming and this is just that. I am able to get 144 FPS on med high setting in warzone! Thatâs nuts. I can get 144 FPS on all games I play. A good update bios from msi just go to their website and download the drivers and this card outperforms higher price cards and it has a backplate! It feels sturdy when installing and cooling idles at 37c under load I reach 60c max under heavy load and thatâs with one case intake fan. I have ordered more and will notice better cooling efficiency highly recommend!

Constant crashes mid game sometimes not even in a game will still crash and restart my PC or force me to manually shut down. AMD has released several driver updates since I bought this a few months ago and nothing has fixed the issues. I do not recommend.

Then I made the switch to NVIDIA with my first card being the 980 Ti Classified (which I still have)...and then working through every new GPU to the current (but soon to be out-dated) RTX 2080 class.

Anyway, I wanted to get a nice mid-range card for a new build and having purchased and used an MSI Z490 chipset to support an Intel Gen 10 Core i7, the 5600 XT Gaming seemed to fit just right.

Though out of my ""comfort zone"" for my new builds, I have been more than pleasantly surprised at the capabilities of this card. No issues with drivers, EZ install, games are no problem, 4K looks great with additional settings in the Radeon Software to enable 10-bit panel support, and so on...

If you are looking for a great mid-range card...GET THIS CARD. You will not be disappointed."

The card is absolutly quiet below 60Âºc and never pass 65Âºc while gaming, noise level is very low. It sports 2x8pin power plugs but at 100% gpu usage it does not disipate more then 100 watts so dont be scared. It is at least 30% faster than my 1660 super. PS: as of July 2020 zero driver's issues.

MSI's app for managing and overclocking is the best I ever used. ASUS's app was useless. This 5600XT is more expensive than others out there but it is definitely worth the extra.

Beware that this is a long and heavy card, check the picture above posing near my former 1660s."

Overclocking was much better before vbios update that ""made the card faster"" but gimped it from overclocking like before due to it being able to reach 5700 speeds. So the vbios limits how much you can overclock now artificially.

Design of the card is great and the fans keep it cool, most of the time the fans don't come on as not needed. I've only heard them at 100% once and that was since I set them to 100%, during gaming they come on at about 25%-50% speed and able to cool the card off.

No RGB on the card, I don't care for RGB but if you do then this one doesn't have it. If I had to do it over again I'd prob would have gotten the 5700 or waited for the new cards but I don't do 4k gaming so just went with what I needed."

You can just sense the power emitting from its sleekness. The price of this card has now doubled since it came in the mail in November 2020 if that tells you anything. Feels great to load out games faster than your friends that spent hundreds of dollars more on their set up.

*NOTE*
The card wasn't showing up in the device manager when I got the rig fired up(make sure you get the card in the PCIe x16 slot 1... for my mobo it was the one that was recommend to work better for 2nd gen Ryzen CPU). Don't worry, just head to AMD's website and there is a section for this graphics card in the driver downloads. It was slightly confusing while trying to situate the drivers because I thought I needed to get them from the MSI website. The MSI website will just give you performance applications to monitor your beast. AMD will get you RADEON software that has Adrenaline that will push drivers to your AMD CPU and GPU. Hopefully this will save you the frustration of not being able to get to the good stuff in a timely manner."

1. It's deceptively large, measuring 297mm long, bigger than a lot of cards with 3 fans, even though it only has 2 fans. Make sure it fits in your case before you buy it.
2. Most RX 5600 XT's only need one 8-pin power connector, but this one needs two for some reason. Also, it needs the 7th and 8th pins to be connected, so plugging a 6-pin connector directly into it won't work even though it fits. If your power supply only has one 8-pin and one 6-pin connector, you'll need to use a 6-pin to 8-pin adapter to get it to work."

El rendimiento es espectacular con unas temperaturas muy frescas, cabe destacar que este modelo ya viene con su BIOS actualizada por ende no habrÃ¡ problemas en exprimirla en su totalidad.

Su temperatura promedio en reposo es de 29 grados con un consumo de 7w a 60hz

Su temperatura promedio en gaming es de 48 grados con un consumo de 97w a 60hz
Su temperatura promedio en gaming es de 54 grados con un consumo de 98w a 144hz

es sumamente silenciosa en reposo y en carga no es muy diferente, estÃ©ticamente su backplate es hermoso para un gabinete con vidrio templado."

Nice slick design but it's slightly loud but with the side panel on it's not too bad it gets covered if you're using a headset. Great value for the performance you get. AMD drivers seemed to be fix since I've had no issues with black screening or any hiccups. Solid performer and I do recommend this card over the RTX 2060.
