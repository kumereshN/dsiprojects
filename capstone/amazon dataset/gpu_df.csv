"XFX Radeon RX 570 RS XXX Edition 1286MHz, 8gb GDDR5, DX12 VR Ready, Dual BIOS, 3xDP HDMI DVI, AMD Graphics Card (RX-570P8DFD6)",XFX,Amd,$232.79,4.0 out of 5 stars,Change the card's default settings.,"I've been using Geforce for a while, my last card was a GTX 750. But lately their software has been irritating me, causing issues and whatnot especially when it comes to recording games. I did hear that Radeon has caught up with their graphics cards these days so I decided to try out one of their decent cards.

I kinda wished I knew this ahead of time so I could easily find out what was wrong, but chances are YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES when it comes to the card itself. This is the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, as this was infuriating to figure out, as answers were all over the place. The default settings for the card itself can cause various problems, so you'll have to change them via AMD's Wattman or whatever software you want to use.

In my case, everything installed fine, and from what I could tell at first, the card was running okay. But then I launched Monster Hunter World, set all the settings to max and started up my save file. Everything was perfectly smooth, everything looked awesome. But then I started walking around the main area, Astera, and a few seconds later my PC randomly shut down and restarted. No errors, no blue screen, nothing. This would constantly happen with this game (I didn't bother trying with other games, lol), and I spent the entire day looking for answers. A lot of people would jump to conclusions that the PSU is too weak or faulty. I never had any issues with my PSU, and even though it's weak it's still the min requirements for this card. (450w)

So, after all of that, it's these ""Power States"". Maybe it won't affect all PSUs, but when the card constantly switch between these during gaming, it would drive my PSU/PC crazy and force it to shut down/restart. I'm so glad I finally figured that out, I was ready to give up and return the card for a full refund. I fixed this by clicking Power State 1 and ""set at maximum"", then switching to ""Dynamic"" for frequency, put in a number you want to have. This solved it for me, I just want to point this out since a lot of answers out there would jump to conclusions about the PSU itself.

So, after all that was finally fixed, the card was fine, my game looks perfect and run pretty okay. I'm still toying with the graphic settings to get things running 100% smooth. So this is still an awesome card, just be sure to check the card's settings if you're having issues with power."

Except after using this card for more than 2 hours, it starts to crash and screen flicker my monitor. I did everything I could to make sure it wasn't my drivers that was the issue by installing old drivers and new ones and I still got the same problems. I even upgraded to windows 10 and I still have issues with this graphics card crashing my computer. When I plug in my old gpu, it works perfectly even though i used the same connectors and drivers and never once got an issue with my old gpu. So i returned this card and got a replacement, also the display ports stopped working after a few days of use. After i got my replacement, I thought the card was good and I didn't have to return it but same issues started to happen after using this card again for more than 2 hours. I felt like they sent me faulty cards on purpose or they don't test their graphics cards because twice in a row I got faulty cards from this manufacturer. I had such a massive headache from this card from this manufacturer. I tried to play devils advocate and gave XFX a chance to to redeem themselves by giving me a replacement gpu and that even didn't worked. I will never buy from this manufacturer ever again because I never had this issue with other gpu makers but this one I have to deal with constant crashing of my drivers and computer but when I use my other gpu's I have no issues. This manufacture made me lost trust in AMD because even though 150 bucks isn't a lot to most people, it means a lot to me because my family lives pay check to pay check and it's hard to save up that kind of money and for the product that I paid for to die on me in less than 2 weeks is absurd."

This card does not disappoint it's f****** awesome, Fornite at 1920X1080 100 FPS in performance mode without overclocking. Apex legends in the menu 150 FPS in game highest 112 FPS when things get crowded about 70 it has dipped as low as 58 FPS but that's impressive with this buget GPU and Budget CPU. Dolphin emulator all GameCube games play perfect Mario sunshine in at 50 FPS other games look great like HD remasters!! such as Mario's brothers mansion. Brawl for Wii locked at 60 FPS in fullscreen. No errors in N64 or Wii/GC emulators. My favorite part with the software from amd it's super simple to keep track of CPU,GPU,RAM usage and load. The fans on this GPU may not spin at all unless the temp is at 60C or above so don't freak if the fans are not spinning with the AMD software in the performance section you can override 0 RPM and have fans spin at desired speed. Hope this helped!"

Just got a 1603 error.,"This graphics card looks pretty amazing for the price, too bad I can't use it. I was able to install the card, hook up the power supply, but when I went to install the drivers, the problems hit. I got a 1603 error so I couldn't install the AMD Adrenalin 2020 control center which you need to make adjustments to your settings. The default settings were not good for gaming. After running the AMD utility, running the DDU utility, removing any possible conflicts, scanning for any corrupt files (there were none), and reinstalling the AMD software, I just kept getting the 1603 error. Even AMD's tech support couldn't help. It's too bad because this card seems like a great deal for an 8gb graphics card. Oh well, back to Nvidia."

Decent gaming with 1080p.

AVOID installing the Radeon Adrenalin software package. Version 2020-edition-20.4.2-apr23 crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME with Doom Eternal in Windows 10 x64. Run the Adrenalin software package to unpack the drivers, then cancel the installation. Then manually install the drivers through the Windows device manager from the directory where the drivers were unpacked to avoid installing the PURELY OPTIONAL Adrenalin software.

Fan noise is barely audible-to-acceptable when gaming. I'm using a full-sized ATX with 120mm intakes and exhausts, so air flow around the video card isn't a problem. Fans are barely audible within a fully-enclosed ATX case when playing Doom Eternal at 1920x1080 / Ultra Nightmare Settings, but it can burst to 100% LOUD AS HELL during POST and stress testing. And I mean LOUD, like fan noise from a 1000 watt microwave kitchen oven!

What's weird about this card is that it has 2 heat pipes installed BUT it has room for a 3rd. There are cut-outs in the heat fins and extra space in the heat-sink where a 3rd heat pipe can be installed, but are purposely left empty. It still works, though."

The card itself seems good, however, their driver support is beyond horrifying. I get constant flickering in any game I try to play. If that isn't annoying enough, I also get this infuriating series of beeps whenever I hit the Ctrl, Alt, Shift keys whether I'm in a game or using Word, etc.
I've tried all the recommended fixes including using the AMD cleanup utility in Safe Mode to remove all traces of the drivers, then downloading and installing the latest version. If you don't have good drivers, even the best hardware is a hopeless pile of trash.
In my opinion, that is exactly what AMD has turned this product into...trash. Thanks AMD, it hasn't been fun."

I wasn't completely sure if this would support our application, but it turned out to be the perfect choice. We did have to purchase 3 cables to go from the card's 3 DisplayPorts to the HDMI inputs on 3 of the monitors and connected the 4th using a standard HDMI cable. Worth noting that you will need two 6-pin power cables available from your PC's power supply to power the card. All in all, the installation and setup took less than an hour. But, that included setting up four displays and downloading the drivers, physically installing the card, etc... I recommend this to anyone needing up to 4 monitors controlled with one display adapter."

I bought this specific card only because it was a deal too good to pass up. This GPU will do everything you need it to and more. From gaming to streaming, the RX 570 will power through it no problem.
Here's my take:

The good:
+ It has no problem playing most AAA's on Ultra or high setting.
+ It runs fairly quiet (idles ~1900).
+ Plays most titles at 60-150+ FPS.
+ Looks good.
+ Low power requirement (450w)
+ Extremely budget friendly for a 8GB GPU.

The Bad:
- RUNS HOT! Even though it is quiet at idle, under load this sucker gets warm. You can expect this guy to hit 80-85c.
- ""Overclockable"". YES, in a sense. As with all GPU's your results will vary.
- Not a NVIDIA.

The Neutral:
+/- Nothing fancy. Only LED on the board is a somewhat annoying small blue light facing outward.

By no means am I regretting this purchase. This card is a work horse and does a wonderful job. However, I do not expect this GPU's lifespan to be a long one. It runs way too hot when doing anything that requires a bit more processing power. Most games run at regular temperatures (65-70c) and idle never jumps over 30c.
But, throw something a little more taxing on it and it will easily rise to unacceptable levels quickly. For me this only happened with certain titles, mostly Xbox PC games (Microsoft Flight Simulator/Cities: Skylines...). All while handling games like Doom, MW and Warframe without even breaking a sweat.
As for the Overclock features, I chose to under-clock and under-volt, going down around a hundred both ways (~1200MHz/1050mV) in an attempt to prolong the life of this GPU.

Prior to installing, be sure to take the card apart to ensure it has enough/or any thermal paste. Mine barely had a smear, not even enough to cover the processor. I could tell the thermal paste was precision applied as it still had the finger print in it :)

All the software issues everyone claims are out there were not present for me. I had zero issues installing and updating and using. Radeon has really focused on streaming so there appear that there are more settings for streaming than there are for gaming.
***UPDATE 11/8/2020***
I did experience some update issues with the new 20.11.1 patch. This was the first time I had any issues and I just fixed it by rolling back to the previous driver.

Although I eventually plan on replacing this for a 6800, overall, I would say this is a great card for a $500 - $1000 dollar build and you should not be counting it out quite yet."

Then I saw a review mentioning how to tweak the card for even better performance. Those settings were under performance tuning changing the card frequency to 1389 and changing the VRAM frequency to 2050. I also maxed the power limit. One other thing I did do is under cpu workload I changed to compute. It seems like it put more of the workload on the card. Before that my graphic card workload was under 15 percent not it goes up to 70 percent at ultra settings which makes the card do what is supposed to.

Make sure you measure the inside of your case, this sucker is huge. It fit in mine, with inches to spare.

I have speed fan on my desktop, ive used it for years to monitor CPU and GPU temps. with my older video card, I was at 50 C during idle. With this new card, im barely at 31 C.

Under full load, I'm about 74 C WOW!!!!

Its very quiet, due to the fact it doesnt need to come on at lower temps with its Extremely efficient heat sinks etc.

It is rated very high on sites that test all these cards. Im running 3 monitors concurrently, with zero glitches. This is an amazing piece of gear.
I used MSI Afterburner to stress test the card! This card didn't break a sweat.

Ive run all types of real time tests, using HD & 4 K video in Avid media Composer, this card has NOT let me down.

The nice fringy benefit is the Voucher for 2 games! sweeeeeet!

-Great bang for the buck
-AMD's software is actually pretty good
-Card goes into quiet mode if not under heavy load
-Dual Bios, though I've never had a use for it
-Can run most games on medium settings, 60fps 1080p

Cons:
-May run a tad hot after awhile
-Cannot run most modern AAA games at high settings (to be expected)
-1440p gaming might be an issue if your aiming for 60fps, definitely not going to do 144fps

Overall:
-The card is a great bang for the buck
-Never actually personally went above 4gb of Vram being used, so you probably don't need the 8gb version
-The card is equivalent to somewhere in between a 1050ti and a gtx 1060
-The card is already a bit old and may need to be replaced after a year or two if you want to continue to play new releases"

It does not run warm on regular internet browsing. But when I played games it would turn on, on various speeds. So I googled and read and read and read information about this video card, and found out that the 2 fans only run when the actual video card turns hot, which I noticed anyway. So it’s not an issue. But today while playing in my pc I smelled something burning. I have my flashlight handy to check if the fan is on or not for this vid card. So as soon as I focused the flash light I saw that the fans weren’t running. I immediately went to check and even put my nose close up to each part of the pc, psu, cpu, hdd and this rx 570. The burning smell is coming out from the rx 570 - positive: and when I went back to my monitor, the screen is almost ready to fade away. I hope I just had a bad item. Bec I would be scared for the others that has this in their system. Bottomline goodluck peeps.

Update 8/23/20
So I returned the xfx card and got MSI gtx 1650. The msi’s fam turns on at 63c. And so far does not go beyond 70c.. i just wanted to point out that most probably I recevied a bad xfx card.
Technically speaking though, the xfx runs smoother than the msi but just runs firey hot bec of the fan issue"

Installed on older MB with PCIe 2 slots, rather than the PCIe 3 the card is intended for.
Software/driver package said it failed to install, but the card is working, I can adjust the settings and it runs my 3 monitors. Fit in my Liam case just fine. I did have a problem initially and the tech support was better than I was anticipating, got me pointed in the right direction.
I ran Firmark and loaded the card up to 100% - It gets up to temp right away, lol but the fans kicks in pretty quick, under that load, the fans are at 100% too! But you really can't hear them - I certainly expected that 100% I'd hear them. I have 7 HD's and a stock cooler, 3 case fans and a pretty passive PS fan - My kit is pretty quiet - This card replaced a passive one and doesn't seem any louder. Under no load the fans in the VC stop and cycle on and off independently. When it first starts up, you can hear the fans, lol! Firmark in the low 40's at my native 2560x1600.
Seems like a pretty good card for the price - May not be a speed demon though."
"XFX Radeon RX 570 RS XXX Edition 1286MHz, 8gb GDDR5, DX12 VR Ready, Dual BIOS, 3xDP HDMI DVI, AMD Graphics Card (RX-570P8DFD6)",XFX,Amd,$232.79,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's alright if you're on a tight budget,"The good: You'll play most modern games @1080p with high settings above @60 fps. I played Gears 5 @1440p with mostly ultra settings and I found it used almost all the 8gb of memory in some instances so I was glad I didn't go with a 4gb. Many modern games are using 5-6gb from what I've experienced when pushing this card so the extra cost is worth the investment imo.

The bad: It runs pretty hot (89-90c) in a case with 2 120mm fans (inlet/outlet). I mean it's a little scary, but it never throttles at those temps. Personally I didn't like those temps so what I did was install MSI afterburner, undervolted it by 100 mV, downclocked it to 1200mhz, and set the fans to run at 60% all the time. This resulted in significant temp drops down into the lower to mid 70's with little noticeable performance loss.

Other thoughts: It black screens once in awhile when exiting games and watching YouTube. I tried different drivers, set it at stock settings, blah blah, but nothing helps. Not sure if it's the drivers or the card, but I'm guessing it's the drivers. I thought AMD was making better drivers these days, but I dunno. I guess I got spoiled using the green team over the years. Honestly I wish I would have waited longer and saved up for a 1660 super, but that card wasn't out yet so no reason crying over spilt milk. At least with the 8gb of memory I should be okay for a little while."

I was then thinking I would put it in my current PC.

I opened in finally in anticipation that it could still use it even though I didn't get to build my new computer -- and I could not get past the fact it was scratched up -- new in the box.

The manufacturer did have protective plastic covering most of the plastic (which itself is scratched - thankfully they cover it up) but there were a few places that did not have protective covering.... The name plate and a small square on the back --- and wouldn't you know those places are the worst looking scratches.

I despise getting new products that are scratched. Especially a computer part that is scratched up. Who wants it in their PC like that? Returning. 3-stars because it is a massive piece of equipment that I would have kept otherwise if not scratched up and showing signs it was handled rough.

Please be sure you have room for this in you PC case!!! It is HUGE!"

I wanted to provide this review from a different perspective other than gaming. I have three Dell 24 inch HD monitor setup. All with display port connection. Motherboard video max out on two connections (one HDMI/DVI and one VGA). I researched on a low budget graphics card that will allow more than two monitors with HD connection to all.

Pro tip: a 6 pin connector and 2 pin connector from the power supply fits into the 8pin 8GB version. Was scared when I saw it, then did some research. 6+2=8 and it's official.

A few things to note:

1: This is a fairly large GPU, if you don't have a Full Tower, or an opened-air mobo, your mileage with fitting this thing in a Mid Tower WILL differ

2: My old GPU require two 6-pin, while this GPU required one 8-pin, you will either need an 8-pin or a 6+2 pin to connect your power supply to your GPU, if you don't have a powersupply that you modify, well you will need a new one.

3: For the price, this GPU is very strong, even if it is only a rehash of the 480... and being a year old. It can still run newer titles like Monster Hunter: World without too many problems.

4: Price-wise, having to compete with cryto-miners may increase the price of this GPU from time to time... very annoying.

5: This is a major update from my old HD 7950 (which still works for many games that are moderately intense and are new.)"

The first one wouldn't work at all, the second one worked for less than two months. When it was working, it was beautiful but it has to work. I will never again buy an XFX product.

I've spent about 6 hours trying to troubleshoot this card. So far I've not gotten it to work once. System POSTs, windows sounds tell me that windows is booting, but I NEVER get any video. Forced driver installation overtop old graphics card and reset with new driver. Still nothing. This isn't my first graphics card installation, and I've never had one go this poorly. Did I get a dud?

EDIT: The first one never did work, but the replacement worked fine. Had to purchase a new Power Supply to get full use out of it. Perhaps I have a needy system but 500W wasn't enough to get it running at max efficiency. What I will say is that, now that I have it running properly, the picture is GORGEOUS. Absolutely love it.

EDIT 12/12/2018 - So my saga of the XFX Radeon RX 580 has come to an end. I am returning the card after some very helpful product support from Amazon worked through diagnosing issues on the second card, which replaced the one that wouldn't work from the start. I had the card installed for about 40-45 days before it cut out in the middle of playing a game one night. The system wouldn't even post, so I thought it might be an issue with the motherboard or the power supply which I had purchased to power this card. During diagnostics, it turns out it was the video card, which I learned was indicating a defective card. (Genuine thanks to Amazon Product Support!) It was preventing the system from even POSTing.

This card is headed to UPS today and I will never again purchase an XFX product. I can be pretty forgiving and recognize that sometimes flawed products make it through. This, however, is indicative to me of a larger issue."

At 2560x1080 ultrawide, it slays the games I play. GTA 5 and Fallout 4 nearly max out (sometimes have to trade shadow quality for SSAA or vice-versa depending on preferences) and I have absolutely no problem maintaining 60fps with 70°c or below while playing them. I will be testing more titles but if you are below 1440p this card should be able to play anything at medium settings or above incl. new titles. I have it at 1384MHz with a custom fancurve to keep temps in check (this fan really isn't very loud at 50% or below anyways; I had to put my m.2 under the GPU which makes me a little nervous so I'd rather have the area as actively cooled as possible) but it does in fact sit at 0rpm unless you're gaming which is very nice. I'd recommend this card for any gaming under 1440p or even at 1440p lower-mid settings depending on the games you prefer; it seems very reliable so far and the 8gb vram is nice; having high-res textures in games is super nice, and I've had no problems; I'd recommend this over the 1060 6gb unless you can get one for $230 or less.

Update: Pushing memclocks to 2250 in wattman will squeeze a few extra frames out of furmark and so far seems stable on my card. Increasing clockspeeds actually made performance slightly worse for furmark likely due to it causing throttling, so I actually have the core at 1350MHz and the mem at 2250MHz now, running a little better than stock.

Edit 8 months later: I had IMC issues with Ryzen 5 2600 and tried rma this card thinking it was at fault because I had BSODs and CTDs while gaming. Ended up replacing the CPU and found out it was not the gpu. However playing far cry at 1080 ultra for 45 min caused the gpu to crap out. No Mobo would post with it installed. I have reached out to their support and hope to hear back. Last time they were prompt but I did assemble and reassemble the gpu with new tm (to no avail) which technically voids warranty. If they don't hold up on warranty that's my fault but if so I'll be ecstatic. Good experience mostly but too bad multiple faulty parts have left me with a great PC becoming useless.

2020: Laaaate update - XFX straight up sent me a brand new retail card many months ago and have had no issues since. RMA is very good in the US."

After many hours of troubleshooting the obvious (swapping cables, reinstalling, etc) it is narrowed down to a lack of bandwidth or too much noise on the HDMI port.

It seems that the drivers detect the display and set the color space to 4:4:4, which in my experience is unstable on this card on any display. Under this setting, it's impossible to game because the screen blanks out every couple seconds. I've tried a dozen different cables with no improvement, even a cable known to work perfectly at 4k 60hz on Xbox One X.

My running theory is that the port itself can't handle the required 18gbps bandwidth that 4:4:4 4k 60hz requires, and/or the card produces enough electrical noise (under load) that it bleeds into the port causing the display to re-handshake repeatedly.

Switching to displayport works fine, but if you're stuck on HDMI 2.0, this should help:

Change the color format to 4:2:0 in Radeon display settings. 4:2:2 is also unstable for me.

No overclocking, actually I turned the clock speed down to keep in step with the heat and turned the fans on earlier and to higher speed with the AMD tuner software. I have large tower with plenty of of intake and exhaust fans and my chipset temperature is 33 Celsius on idle, so it's not my system. Also my older card doesn't have this problem. This card- just simply gave up on a pause screen for 1 minute, playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. The fans were spinning but nothing seems to help this card in control.
I have to say this isn't the first ATI card doing this to me, but at least my previous RX 480 was stable, although it was running a bit hot. My previous GFX card was a GTX 980 and runs without a hiccup, no overheating no issues whatsoever, what I needed is more RAM, my GTX had only 4, and some games today won't even try to load the textures for high/very high settings if the game doesn't detects at least 6GB of RAM.
What happens is, the game (any game using 3D engine apparently) runs ok for about 5-10 minutes and then the monitor suddenly goes to sleep for about 2 seconds, and then it comes up. It will keep repeating this until I turn off the game. Also the fans are way too loud on this. Even with not so demanding games, games that were made 3-4yrs ago, the fans kick in and run loud like it's struggling to keep the heat down, even though an on-board graphics from Intel or AMD could run those games with no issues.
I only got this card, because I built a whole new AMD system,
Ryzen 2600 CPU
16GB RAM
480GB SSD +1TB HD
*(prevously GTX 980)
I literally tried all settings on both the card, the monitor, my PC, even fresh installation of Win10, then card driver cleaning, replacing fans in my pc case, adding more, buying new diplayport cables, trying HDMI cables, nothing fixes it.

I got the xfx Rx 580 GTA 1386mhz last Wednesday 9-19-18 and man my old reference rx480 definitely had power draw problems. I knew something was amuck but couldn't prove it.

Day 1. Installed and ran firestrike. My old graphics score was beat by 200 points higher by this card.

Day 2. Opened up doom and barely got below 85 fps in 1080p. Even battlefront 2 had better performance for me. I think it was 75+ fps (I have an i7 4790 non k and regretting not getting the k)

Day 3. card runs beautiful I played some online doom and didn't have any lag or low fps as expected.

I'm now on day 5. And not regretting buying this card. I even overclocked it to 1450mhz and 2050 on VRAM and it doesn't give me a hitch or any issues!

Day 19
I have no problems with the card. It handles everything I throw at it! Even squad. I have to use a bunch of medium settings due to amds compatibility, but I get 60fps.on most areas with my i7 4790."

While running at stock settings, the card runs relatively cool and quiet. My card overclocked pretty well, and I'm able to get an additional 10% of performance at the expense of higher temps and louder fans. At stock settings, the GPU stays below 70c at load, and up to 82c with my current overclock. I'm able to run the new Resident Evil 2 with Max settings at a locked 1080p/60 with ease. I am also able to run a locked 4K/30 in RE2 with no drops in performance. Many older games are able to run at resolutions up to 4K/60, and many modern games are even good at 1440p/60.

AMD's software is leaps and bounds above what I remember from the Catalyst Software days. I remember having driver problems which cause sound problems over HDMI when I had an HD 7870. I also had problems with the Crimson Drivers in an RX 480 build I did for a friend a couple years back. In that build, I had to loan him one of my GTX cards for a few months because his RX 480 was unusable due to a driver issue that caused the screen to flicker black. After a driver update, the GPU finally worked for him. I have had no issues with my RX 580, and the only crashes I've had are from pushing my overclock slightly too far. After dialing my OC back, I have run it for hours straight with 82c temps without a hitch.

Now the best part, I basically got this card for $85 thanks to the bundled games. I planned on waiting for AMD's new cards later this year, but I had a friend who told me he was getting Resident Evil 2 and The Division 2 when they released. I asked him if he would be willing to buy the codes from me to help lower the cost of a new GPU, and he agreed. So after tax, my $205 (including tax) RX 580 became an $85 steal after selling the bundled games to my friend for $120. If you know someone wanting to buy both games, or you intend on getting 2 of the 3 games, I believe this card is a no-brainer. You can easily sell the card for over $85 over the next couple of years if you decide you want to upgrade to something faster.

Keep in mind, claiming the free games requires a bit of effort, and it would be hard to sell the free games to anyone you don't know. Basically, I had to create an AMD rewards account to claim the games. The account has to detect the GPU installed in your system to claim the free games, so you can't simply sell the AMD key to someone else. Once the AMD activation site confirms your hardware, it allows you to choose 2 out of the 3 games available: Resident Evil 2, The Division 2, and Devil May Cry 5. Once those games are chosen, then the AMD account has to be tied to your Steam account to activate the game to the steam library. Again, it works with a willing friend, but it will be difficult to do if you plan on selling the keys to someone you don't know well.

All in all, I am really happy with this purchase. If crossfire was still worth using these days, I would buy another one and keep the bundled games for myself. It's that good of a deal.

A final thought, if you are interested in all 3 of the bundled games, the RX 590, Vega 56, Vega 64, and the upcoming Radeon VII come with all 3 games: effectively lowering the cost of those GPU's a staggering $180! If my friend could have waited a couple of weeks to play RE2, I would have waited for the Radeon VII's release. But he couldn't wait, and I'm still very satisfied that I jumped on a great deal!"

The card itself works well, to reassure anybody who might be on the fence or needs a video card as soon as possible. A replacement card for my now dead 970 from newegg arrived DoA (One of those 100 buck sapphire 470s), so, out of panic, knowing that my RMA would probably take something along the line of two weeks, I snatched one of these bad boys up at a small premium compared to the offers on other sites. It arrived swift, as per usual, and it plugged in and got working right away. Honestly, I love it, i'd say its right on par with my old 970 at a very agreeable price. To anyone who hasn't looked at in depth performance reviews, one of these cards is able to handle pretty much every recent game, except overly resource-hungry modern titles, at a comfortable 40-60+ fps depending on the setting of your choice and whether or not you add additional shaders. Coming from anything below a 970, whether it be an r9 series, 7xx, radeon xxxx, you should be rather satisfied with one of these cards. I recommend them especially at this price point. I'm not sure if it's posted anywhere on this product page or brought to attention well enough, but you do get a selection of two out of three games coming out soon, so assuming you're interested in the division 2, DMC5, or resident evil 2, this could potentially be a very smart move so you don't have to purchase those any more.

Small(large) edit: So, apparently I thought I was having issues with this thing once I switched to a 1440p monitor; however, there is a pretty gigantic quirk that I thought might bring light so some common complications with this card. This card is best for 1080p gaming, period. However, with 1440p it can work, but there is a bit of a complication with how AMD gpus tend to work in general lately, especially the Polaris line, which this card belongs to. You may notice that sometimes under intense load that your screen might flicker. This brought me no end of annoyance at first, but I discovered that you basically have to go into global settings (under ""Gaming"") with radeon's software and tab into wattman to do some editing. At the bare minimum, without any other adjustments, you need to adjust the power limit on this card to around +20%~ or more if it has to do any heavy lifting, otherwise it will throttle one way or another with differing symptoms. Amd has thrown out a bunch of efficiency software and tuning which end up under powering your card where it may need it in desperate times. This isn't overclocking, but this does actually allow for proper overclocking, if you don't wish to proceed any further than this, you don't need to. I'm not sure why they thought it would be wise to essentially choke this thing for power right out of the box, but it seems to be a reality. My card works as it should now 1440p, but do monitor temperatures with HW monitor, and adjust the fan speed curve as need be, just to be certain (My case has awful airflow). Wattman can be a fantastic utility, so utilize it!

Just be sure you have enough power to back the card up, I do fine @ 550W and an i5 6600k, but you should plan out your power usage just as a precaution. Knowledge is power!"

I had a decent price and a nice bump in graphics over my previous older card. But about 5 months after I got it we started having these system hang/crashes where the whole screen goes dark. The system was still on and had to be hard powered off to get it back up. This only happened during GPU heavy games needing to take the card above 50% capacity.

We tried to reinstall drives, reseat the card, reformat the OS, then adjust the settings. All of these failed to resolve the issue. We then thought it might be related to the CPU or its heatsinks so we put in a new motherboard, memory, and CPU. This also had no effect, so I go looking for this issue and low and behold I am not the first person to have this problem. So now we are getting a new card from a new company and not cheeping out on the price.

MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB GDRR3 64-bit HDCP Support DirectX 12 OpenGL 4.5 Single Fan Low Profile Graphics Card (GT 710 2GD3 LP),MSI COMPUTER,Nvidia,$51.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Inexpensive and works great in my small-form-factor PC,"I need a graphic card upgrade for a very old compact desktop PC, Acer Aspire A3910 from 2010. This  is an entry-level graphic card that fits my requirements perfectly. Here are several reasons why I picked this card instead of something more powerful:
- It is relatively inexpensive.
- It is low profile and occupies only one PCI slot. This is important since my PC has a SFF (small form factor) case with limited space.
- It consumes very little power (20W max), so even the 220W power supply in my PC can handle it.
- It uses only heatsink for passive cooling. This eliminates the noise and reliability problems associated with cooling fans.

[Installation Confusion]
- Initially right after the graphic card was installed, I can only get a display of 1200x800 from the HDMI port. Nothing from VGA port.
- After I installed the MSI VGA Drivers from disc, my monitor can now display 1920x1080 from VGA port, but nothing from HDMI port.

The problem could be from my computer's motherboard, since I observed the same behavior with the  I previously purchased (and returned). Just keep this behavior in mind, in case you cannot see any display right after installing the card.

[Graphic Performance]
I ran the 3DMARK 'Cloud Gate' benchmark on my PC, both before and after the graphic card upgrade:
- With integrated graphic, the overall score is a pathetic 209.
- After installing the GT 710, the score jumps up to 3735!
(see my uploaded screenshots for details)

On the other hand, the GT 710 cannot hold a candle against my better graphic card, the . When both cards were tested in a newer desktop PC (), the 750 gives about 4x higher score . Note that the 750 does not fit in my old SFF PC since it is much larger. See my photo uploaded for size comparison between 710 and 750.

[Power Consumption]
I used the  to measure the input power of my computer:
- Before the graphic card upgrade, my computer consumes ~50-55W when idle, ~70-75W when running 3DMARK.
- After the upgrade to GT 710, my PC consumes the same 50-55W when idle. This means this graphic card has the same standby power as the integrated graphic chip set.
- When running 3DMARK or , my PC now consumes up to 85-90W. That means the graphic card consumes 15-20W when it is running at full speed.

After I played XCOM for several hours, the heatsink becomes too hot to touch, but not hot enough to cause a shutdown. In contrast, the EVGA GeForce 210 suffers thermal shudown after just ~10-20 minutes of playing XCOM. This is because the 210 consumes more power (30W vs. 20W) but comes with a smaller heatsink.

[Conclusion]
The GT 710 works very well in my particular situation. Of cause this is an inexpensive entry-level card, so I cannot expect the same level of performance as my GeForce GTX 750 Ti. But for a very small investment, I'm suddenly able to play many games which were previously unplayable on my old SFF PC. For that I'm happy."

I was looking for a way to boost the performance of an old Gateway SX2801-01e, thin profile desktop. It was maxed out on RAM (8 GB), but for whatever reason, just couldn't seem to generate graphics smoothly and without struggling. Not gaming, mind you, but for place-shifting and streaming video, and having multiple applications open. This card fit in the sole expansion slot for a PCI x16 card. My main concern was that the dated BIOS would be too ancient, or that the card would simply freeze up the computer. Neither happened. It booted into low-resolution at first while the drivers updated automatically. But after the updates and a couple of reboots, I was back in business. This old desktop has new life, as it runs like a new computer. (I had already migrated to a Samsung SSD and added a USB 3.0 card.) The built-in 2GB or RAM is supremely helpful. I'm also running with a 220W power supply, and not the recommended 300W without issues. It consumes a mere 19W. I'm going to upgrade my older monitor with a higher-resolution one now that the graphics card can support it."

Instructions are not included for installing the low profile bracket. What you do:
Use a pair of needle nose pliers and unscrew the long bracket by twisting the little bolts that you woudl normally screw the video cable into. Just pinch the sides of each bolt and give little short twists (lefty loosey) until it comes loose, keep track of your bolts, and then once all four are out, you can easily separate the VGA socket (at the top in the main picture). The included short profile brackets are pretty obvious for placement, just watch the orientation. You'll end up using two of your external slots, but only the one PCI slot on the motherboard. The little bolts screw back in to the new brackets, and it's just fast and simple. I don't even think I ended up using a screwdriver at all, but the case we have was pretty much made for fast, painless installation without tools. The pliers are a must, though.

While this does say it requires a 300w power supply, it's running absolutely fine on a 240w power supply. Didn't even have to plug it in to a separate power cable (which is good, because there wasn't one.) We're using it for older Steam games (Spore, for example) for my kid, on a Windows 7 machine we bought for $250, and this upgrade brings the machine pretty painlessly up to a decent standard for a lot of games. Just don't try to max your graphics out, because you don't want to overheat a fanless card.

Anyway, I'm pleased. Oh, and everything comes packaged with little red caps over the connectors, which makes handling it a lot less nerve wracking while you're figuring the brackets out. A card I can hold easily while dicking around with the bracket? Thank you! They recommend using rubber gloves to avoid nicks, and I didn't, but this still may be the first time I've installed a video card when I didn't end up bleeding."

I'll buy a different brand and send this one back to Amazon if that is their support.
Update 11/26/18: Are these cards not any good? Should I return this one for credit and purchase a better card. After purchasing this card, the HDMI slot lost the sound. I contacted the vendor and they wanted it returned for repair. It was only a week or so old. Instead of sending it in, I paid another $9 or so for a DVI to HDMI adapter cable and used the DVI slot on the card. I received sound and pictures for about 3 months and ow the sound has gone out on the DVI slot on the card. I did not want to return it as then my PC is out of video and sound until they take their sweet time to repair a $30 card rather than ship me a new one. This has broken twice so I recommend not to purchase this card for anything as it is junk and the customer support lacks a lot of support."

There was originally only 4GB of RAM on the machine and integrated graphics. It would not even play Fortnite. After adding the graphics card it would play but did lag or would even crash some times. I then upgraded the RAM with an additional 8GB (4GB x 2 sticks) for a total of 12GB. Now he says it plays pretty smooth with no lagging or crashing. He does have the resolution turned down to the lowest setting. It's a $45 card and that's what I would expect, but I don't think he tried to turn it up since adding the RAM. He wasn't looking to build a gaming rig and just needed a better graphics card over what was integrated.

His specs:
Dell Vostro 460
i5 processor
12GB RAM
320GB 7200 RPM HD

I also bought the 4 year warranty on it for $1.54, so he can nuke it and I don't care. :)"

Their quality is great, their cards perform well and their Afterburner software is second to none.

Let's be up front about one thing here: a GT 710 is a GT 710. If you're looking for a gaming card, even just to play Windows Store games, look to at least a 730 or, better, a 750 Ti for entry level gaming.

With that behind us, let's talk about reasonable expectations for a 710. The purpose of a 710 is to give an old computer with no digital video output an HDMI jack. It's to beef up a PC with vintage 2006 integrated graphics and allow it to work with modern displays. It's my expectation that if a graphics card supports a given resolution, be that 1080p, 1440p or even 4k, that it will be capable of smooth video playback at that resolution. I chose this 710 for my HTPC because it supports 4k resolution, and I just needed my ancient PC to push 4k video. That's it.

And here's where this card failed me. 4k video playback was subpar. It was choppy, the HDMI audio cut in and out, and it wasn't just one source. YouTube, local content, it all looked bad. 1080p was much better, but the 4K display did it no favors.

The 710's saving grace was that it was able to push convincing 1080p video to a 1080p monitor, and maybe that's really all it's useful for. If that's your use case, and for plenty of people I'm sure it is, this is a decent, cheap card for you.

Mine was returned. I didn't even bother goofing around with overclocking or temperature testing because I just didn't see a need to. The 710 clearly wasn't quite enough for my needs."

It replaced old ATI HD 4600 series graphics cards which developed issues with dual monitor with the original Windows 10 creators Update and new blue screen issues with the Fall Creators Update. While ATI stopped supporting their product in 2015, Nvidia still releases a solid set of drivers that support the latest version of Windows 10. This MSI version of the GT 710 is very flexible. It supports both low profile (2 slots with brackets included), and standard profile (only 1 slot needed), and is cable of driving 2 HD monitors with ease. Compared to the HD 4650 it was replaced with, the 2d images and text see clearer and the colors more vibrant, even on 15 year old monitors running analog. Even though this is not a gaming card, it holds its own for the light to casual gamer and does not need a lot of power from the PSU to do so."

Solid DXVA capabilities for an HTPC. Worked great to replace a dying 7600GS in my dad's computer. Very low power.

Passive cooling might not be enough for this card if you task it alot and have a case with very low airflow. My dad's small form factor PC saw it running in the 80s celsius just running some light games. I attached a slim low-noise 40mm fan to it with a ziptie and that was easily enough to cool it down. Now it never gets above 60*C when playing games for hours. So be aware the cooler is just too small to be a good passive cooler for games and DXVA in a super tight case. In a case with better airflow this is probably less of an issue.

It's paired with a C2D E7500 Wolfdale 2.93Ghz and 8GB DDR-2 800 RAM so not an amazing PC but enough to push this card along well enough. It runs Youtube, Netflix and Media Player Classic with 1080p mkvs smoothly. It has HDMI output which makes it good for our occasional HTPC needs. Again the card does DXVA okay, but not amazingly. Combined with the CPU it's more than enough to handle high bitrate 1080p which is the goal. So for that it's pretty useful despite the low performance. Better at DXVA than the 7600GS by a longshot.

Modern features but very weak performance. Runs older games somewhat worse than the ancient 7600GS it replaced, and newer games just a little better. This card isn't intended for games, but it would be nice to see it perform more like its specs. It's not as disastrous as the GT210 was, with simply broken performance, but it's pretty weak.

That said, it runs Source games okay with the settings scaled back, and runs Battlefield 1942, Call of Duty/UO and lots of other popular older games. My dad uses it to play Rome Total War and Medieval 2 nearly cranked which makes him happy. Runs most lighter-weight newer games with low settings as well. So it's not totally helpless, but it's not meant to compete as a gaming card. AMD's APUs are much faster than this, and the integrated in newer Intel CPUs is also much faster. For my dad's older PC though, this MSI GT710 was a perfectly reasonable replacement part."

Not the best but it'll get the job done.,"This is an older card of course so I can't recommend it for newer gaming. But It can keep up with maybe 80% of my steam library, which has lots of games pre-2016. Just don't expect to do some seriously high-end gaming and you're probably fine. Always check the game's specs and if a card is still in support when looking for what you need.

It was A BUTT to get the screws out to install it into the case because they were in so tight, but everything else about the install went smoothly. We have an HD monitor, and everything looks great. Supports the sound to said monitor as well. NVIDIA drivers are fantastic because they let you know when there's an update unobtrusively and they're very simple to install. Just a few clicks and 1-2 screen flashes and you're done. Supports dual monitors.

This went into a half-tower with an offensively small power supply (300w) so I had to unplug the blu-ray drive but it is working fantastically. For the price, I really have no complaints. It's been working great, and since the card is still in support, you'll continue to get drivers so your games don't crash suddenly. Or cook itself to death, like the card it replaced."

Short story. RMA'd the card. Was quickly repaired and sent back to me via Fedex (less then 2 weeks). However MSI didn't bother to ask me if it needed any special instructions return shipping, so it didn't bother to tell Fedex to make sure I signed for it. Fedex said they delivered it (to my door) so I am 100% certain it was stolen (for my neighborhood, thats a big fat DUH). MSI says its not their fault, and that if I had wanted it signed for I should have called and said so. One guy told me that they don't automatically tell Fedex to make sure its signed for because it costs them more to ship it that way.

In short. too bad, your screwed, we didn't follow up on getting proper shipping instructions or even bother to ASK YOU if we should. Its your fault it got stolen, deal with it. Tried to call Corporate HQ multiple times, the secretary is NEVER there, messages go unanswered. 2 months now without a card.

Great for business use!,"I needed a video card quickly to get my office PC back up and running. For some reason, my old video card stopped outputting 3840x2160 @ 30Hz (30 frames/sec), and went back down to 1080p. Because my monitor at the office is 3840x2160, that meant I only had 1/4 as much space for windows, and my productivity was hurting.
My old card, a Radeon HD 5450, required that I use drivers from 2012 to let me drive that video timing out on HDMI. But one fateful day, even the old drivers refused to send it, with no explanation as to why. I also had to rig up a little device to keep the HPD (Hot Plug Detect) signal from going away when I turned my monitor off, or the Radeon would switch to the DVI output. Every. Single. Time. It was really frustrating.
So I went and got this, because I was just looking for a card with the following:
- It outputs 3840x2160 @ 30Hz on HDMI
- It's silent
- Low power
I did about 5 minutes of research, found this, verified on nVidia's website that it would do it (it's spelled out that it will), and whipped out my credit card and hit ""Order Now."" I ordered it on Thursday, and Amazon had it to me on Friday (even though it was normal Prime 2-day shipping). Bonus.
So I crack open my mid-tower, find the old card covered in dust (but it was also a fanless card, and the dust blew right off, no probs), and slap this in. The driver install took ages (gotta have all of those patches and tweaks for games I won't be playing...) and eventually I was back up and running. With this card, 3840x2160 showed up, and was marked as preferred. And when I turn off my monitor and turn it back on again later, it didn't switch to DVI because it decided to. Excellent.
To summarize:
- Works with 2016 drivers in 4K, unlike some other budget cards
- Doesn't decide spontaneously to switch to DVI from HDMI
- I'm happy with it"

It is not and should not be marketed as a ""gaming"" card. I have a ~2015 Dell Optiplex that has a half-height form factor that I use at my work. The motherboard on the Dell only supports a single VGA output and I really prefer a dual-monitor setup for productivity. I had an old XFX-branded Radeon HD5450 in the case that was doing dual-monitor duty just fine for all this time running Windows 7. When Windows 7 support ended my computer had to be reformatted and a fresh Windows 10 install was done with UEFI and Secure Boot enabled. What we discovered was the BIOS/UEFI changes that were necessary were incompatible with the old Radeon card.

I picked up this GT 710 for a very specific use case. It had to be small-form factor (low-profile brackets), had to be low-power and passively cooled, able to support multiple monitors outputs, and had to support UEFI. This MSi card fit all the criteria. It comes with the standard bracket installed but took a matter of minutes to put the 2 included low-profile brackets on with the correct tools. I installed it in the computer very easily but I was surprised that the card only took up about half of a PCI-e slot. The physical length of the card only occupies the first half of the slot and it doesn't even engage the PCI-e locking mechanism. Once the card is bolted down it doesn't move.

It booted fine and worked for me without any additional drivers. The Nvidia control panel was even added by Windows without any user intervention. I'm running the card with the stock power supply and running two 1080p monitors, one on HDMI and one with DVI-D. So far so good."

Also, it didn't really improve the performance of the desktop. But I wanted a card with a fan/heat sink assembly so it would run cooler. My old card didn't have one and it ran at about 118 degrees F. This one runs about 95 F. I didn't buy this card for gaming just wanted a decent card to run in my old Dell Optiplex desktop. I don't need the low profile adapters. Mine isn't a small form factor. But it is nice to have those if in the future if needed for anther PC. The plastic covers for the ports and connectors is a nice touch.

This card arrived quickly, is easy to install and works great for web surfing and emails. My Dad is thrilled with the whisper quiet function too. At only 2gb of video RAM, I would be careful of what games are played with this card.

I purchased this card knowing it was low-profile, which was good. It fit right into the case and snapped in without issue. No need to connect anything beyond that and the whole process took 5 minutes.

The card ships with a driver CD. I installed the drivers and the additional software on the CD but ended up removing the additional software as it related to overclocking and I didn't need it.

I like this card as it costs less than fifty bucks and boosts the overall video performance of PCs with integrated graphics. This 2GB card is better than most of the 1GB cards at around the same price point and provides users with the option to have a dual monitor setup.

-----------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 12/17/2019:
I just picked up a new HDTV, the Samsung 43"" model UN43NU6900BXZA which offers 4K and UHD. Amazon carries it as does Bestbuy and others locally. It may be a baseline model, but, wow, the pic quality is extremely crisp and clean. The MSI Gaming GeForce GT 710 2GB is working perfectly with my new 4K Samsung, using my Mac Pro running Mojave.

This card supports 4K and there was no adjustments in settings needed for setup, the card and my 4K Samsung communicated perfectly and my Mac Pro make the resolution settngs seamlessly in the background upon connecting.
The quality of my Mac Pro now (running Mojave for the present) is stellar. Details, fine text, screen fit, contrast, color...etc...it all looks superb.

If you are considering a 4K display upgrade, YES, this card will work perfectly with it!
---------------------------
I needed an inexpensive card to upgrade my Mac Pro 5.1 mid-2012 and this card works perfectly for that. No power cable needed and a very small profile that won't get in the way of other cards and slots. It is self powered by the PCIe bus so no power cable was needed.

Of course there is no boot screen during boot nor a way to select which drive to boot from if you have more than one OS drive. You can easily though, change the ""start-up"" drive once the OS is booted and loaded in System Preferences, so not a big deal for me.

I am using the HDMI output to a Samsung 1080 HDTV and there was no need to tweak screen fit or anything. The card booted right up to a perfect screen display.

I've tried a few other Apple recommended cards in the past and honestly, none did any better than this. I returned one at over $150 simply because I decided to wait for a lower priced card to do the same thing and this MSI card does! Additionally, this card seems to wake my Mac out of sleep very quickly. The older cards I tried seemed very sluggish to do that, this card seems much more responsive to wake my Mac. A Win-Win in here!

HMDI won't pass the audio, but, no cards out there will do that unless specifically made for a Mac Pro and flashed correctly. I have optical and digital output on my M. Pro so not a biggie.

The card seems responsive and fast and at some point I will do a ""Geekbench"" test. The 1080 on my Samsung HDTV looks crisp and clear output from this card. I would say 1080 looks slightly better on this card than my old OEM one that came installed on my Mac. Small icon seems a bit crisper and clearer. Close to the old card, but, there is definitely a bit of improvement there.

The card is fan cooled and since I won't be gaming with this desktop, it should run very cool routinely.

5 Stars all around and a great way to upgrade an older Mac Pro on the cheap."

A few days later I tried it again to which sparks shot out of my video card. It would have likely fried my whole computer if I hadn't unplugged my power strip from the wall. I later tried another video card that a friend gave me to which I downloaded the drivers for and it worked pretty much fine.

The card does use more power than an nvidia card with similar specs and also creates more heat. But at the same time value for the spec is great. As a product I would give it 4 stars however, XFX's warranty service is surprisingly easy and fast. My card broke after a year of use, so I registered the product on their site, I received a response within 24 hours. They troubleshooted and determined the card needs to be RMAed, I sent the card back and I received a new one within a week after they received the defective card. They didn't even require the receipt(required by most companies) even though I had it. It's amazing service compare to my PNY nvidia experience which was like pulling teeth. I will definitely buy more XFX products in the future."

A few things to note:

1: This is a fairly large GPU, if you don't have a Full Tower, or an opened-air mobo, your mileage with fitting this thing in a Mid Tower WILL differ

2: My old GPU require two 6-pin, while this GPU required one 8-pin, you will either need an 8-pin or a 6+2 pin to connect your power supply to your GPU, if you don't have a powersupply that you modify, well you will need a new one.

3: For the price, this GPU is very strong, even if it is only a rehash of the 480... and being a year old. It can still run newer titles like Monster Hunter: World without too many problems.

4: Price-wise, having to compete with cryto-miners may increase the price of this GPU from time to time... very annoying.

5: This is a major update from my old HD 7950 (which still works for many games that are moderately intense and are new.)"

The first one wouldn't work at all, the second one worked for less than two months. When it was working, it was beautiful but it has to work. I will never again buy an XFX product.

I've spent about 6 hours trying to troubleshoot this card. So far I've not gotten it to work once. System POSTs, windows sounds tell me that windows is booting, but I NEVER get any video. Forced driver installation overtop old graphics card and reset with new driver. Still nothing. This isn't my first graphics card installation, and I've never had one go this poorly. Did I get a dud?

EDIT: The first one never did work, but the replacement worked fine. Had to purchase a new Power Supply to get full use out of it. Perhaps I have a needy system but 500W wasn't enough to get it running at max efficiency. What I will say is that, now that I have it running properly, the picture is GORGEOUS. Absolutely love it.

EDIT 12/12/2018 - So my saga of the XFX Radeon RX 580 has come to an end. I am returning the card after some very helpful product support from Amazon worked through diagnosing issues on the second card, which replaced the one that wouldn't work from the start. I had the card installed for about 40-45 days before it cut out in the middle of playing a game one night. The system wouldn't even post, so I thought it might be an issue with the motherboard or the power supply which I had purchased to power this card. During diagnostics, it turns out it was the video card, which I learned was indicating a defective card. (Genuine thanks to Amazon Product Support!) It was preventing the system from even POSTing.

This card is headed to UPS today and I will never again purchase an XFX product. I can be pretty forgiving and recognize that sometimes flawed products make it through. This, however, is indicative to me of a larger issue."

At 2560x1080 ultrawide, it slays the games I play. GTA 5 and Fallout 4 nearly max out (sometimes have to trade shadow quality for SSAA or vice-versa depending on preferences) and I have absolutely no problem maintaining 60fps with 70°c or below while playing them. I will be testing more titles but if you are below 1440p this card should be able to play anything at medium settings or above incl. new titles. I have it at 1384MHz with a custom fancurve to keep temps in check (this fan really isn't very loud at 50% or below anyways; I had to put my m.2 under the GPU which makes me a little nervous so I'd rather have the area as actively cooled as possible) but it does in fact sit at 0rpm unless you're gaming which is very nice. I'd recommend this card for any gaming under 1440p or even at 1440p lower-mid settings depending on the games you prefer; it seems very reliable so far and the 8gb vram is nice; having high-res textures in games is super nice, and I've had no problems; I'd recommend this over the 1060 6gb unless you can get one for $230 or less.

Update: Pushing memclocks to 2250 in wattman will squeeze a few extra frames out of furmark and so far seems stable on my card. Increasing clockspeeds actually made performance slightly worse for furmark likely due to it causing throttling, so I actually have the core at 1350MHz and the mem at 2250MHz now, running a little better than stock.

Edit 8 months later: I had IMC issues with Ryzen 5 2600 and tried rma this card thinking it was at fault because I had BSODs and CTDs while gaming. Ended up replacing the CPU and found out it was not the gpu. However playing far cry at 1080 ultra for 45 min caused the gpu to crap out. No Mobo would post with it installed. I have reached out to their support and hope to hear back. Last time they were prompt but I did assemble and reassemble the gpu with new tm (to no avail) which technically voids warranty. If they don't hold up on warranty that's my fault but if so I'll be ecstatic. Good experience mostly but too bad multiple faulty parts have left me with a great PC becoming useless.

2020: Laaaate update - XFX straight up sent me a brand new retail card many months ago and have had no issues since. RMA is very good in the US."

After many hours of troubleshooting the obvious (swapping cables, reinstalling, etc) it is narrowed down to a lack of bandwidth or too much noise on the HDMI port.

It seems that the drivers detect the display and set the color space to 4:4:4, which in my experience is unstable on this card on any display. Under this setting, it's impossible to game because the screen blanks out every couple seconds. I've tried a dozen different cables with no improvement, even a cable known to work perfectly at 4k 60hz on Xbox One X.

My running theory is that the port itself can't handle the required 18gbps bandwidth that 4:4:4 4k 60hz requires, and/or the card produces enough electrical noise (under load) that it bleeds into the port causing the display to re-handshake repeatedly.

Switching to displayport works fine, but if you're stuck on HDMI 2.0, this should help:

Change the color format to 4:2:0 in Radeon display settings. 4:2:2 is also unstable for me.

Or

Disable HDMI 2.0 and live with no more than 30hz"

No overclocking, actually I turned the clock speed down to keep in step with the heat and turned the fans on earlier and to higher speed with the AMD tuner software. I have large tower with plenty of of intake and exhaust fans and my chipset temperature is 33 Celsius on idle, so it's not my system. Also my older card doesn't have this problem. This card- just simply gave up on a pause screen for 1 minute, playing Assassin's Creed: Odyssey. The fans were spinning but nothing seems to help this card in control.
I have to say this isn't the first ATI card doing this to me, but at least my previous RX 480 was stable, although it was running a bit hot. My previous GFX card was a GTX 980 and runs without a hiccup, no overheating no issues whatsoever, what I needed is more RAM, my GTX had only 4, and some games today won't even try to load the textures for high/very high settings if the game doesn't detects at least 6GB of RAM.
What happens is, the game (any game using 3D engine apparently) runs ok for about 5-10 minutes and then the monitor suddenly goes to sleep for about 2 seconds, and then it comes up. It will keep repeating this until I turn off the game. Also the fans are way too loud on this. Even with not so demanding games, games that were made 3-4yrs ago, the fans kick in and run loud like it's struggling to keep the heat down, even though an on-board graphics from Intel or AMD could run those games with no issues.
I only got this card, because I built a whole new AMD system,
Ryzen 2600 CPU
16GB RAM
480GB SSD +1TB HD
*(prevously GTX 980)
I literally tried all settings on both the card, the monitor, my PC, even fresh installation of Win10, then card driver cleaning, replacing fans in my pc case, adding more, buying new diplayport cables, trying HDMI cables, nothing fixes it.
I have an LG Ultrawide with FreeSync monitor)

I got the xfx Rx 580 GTA 1386mhz last Wednesday 9-19-18 and man my old reference rx480 definitely had power draw problems. I knew something was amuck but couldn't prove it.

Day 1. Installed and ran firestrike. My old graphics score was beat by 200 points higher by this card.

Day 2. Opened up doom and barely got below 85 fps in 1080p. Even battlefront 2 had better performance for me. I think it was 75+ fps (I have an i7 4790 non k and regretting not getting the k)

Day 3. card runs beautiful I played some online doom and didn't have any lag or low fps as expected.

I'm now on day 5. And not regretting buying this card. I even overclocked it to 1450mhz and 2050 on VRAM and it doesn't give me a hitch or any issues!

Day 19
I have no problems with the card. It handles everything I throw at it! Even squad. I have to use a bunch of medium settings due to amds compatibility, but I get 60fps.on most areas with my i7 4790."

While running at stock settings, the card runs relatively cool and quiet. My card overclocked pretty well, and I'm able to get an additional 10% of performance at the expense of higher temps and louder fans. At stock settings, the GPU stays below 70c at load, and up to 82c with my current overclock. I'm able to run the new Resident Evil 2 with Max settings at a locked 1080p/60 with ease. I am also able to run a locked 4K/30 in RE2 with no drops in performance. Many older games are able to run at resolutions up to 4K/60, and many modern games are even good at 1440p/60.

AMD's software is leaps and bounds above what I remember from the Catalyst Software days. I remember having driver problems which cause sound problems over HDMI when I had an HD 7870. I also had problems with the Crimson Drivers in an RX 480 build I did for a friend a couple years back. In that build, I had to loan him one of my GTX cards for a few months because his RX 480 was unusable due to a driver issue that caused the screen to flicker black. After a driver update, the GPU finally worked for him. I have had no issues with my RX 580, and the only crashes I've had are from pushing my overclock slightly too far. After dialing my OC back, I have run it for hours straight with 82c temps without a hitch.

Now the best part, I basically got this card for $85 thanks to the bundled games. I planned on waiting for AMD's new cards later this year, but I had a friend who told me he was getting Resident Evil 2 and The Division 2 when they released. I asked him if he would be willing to buy the codes from me to help lower the cost of a new GPU, and he agreed. So after tax, my $205 (including tax) RX 580 became an $85 steal after selling the bundled games to my friend for $120. If you know someone wanting to buy both games, or you intend on getting 2 of the 3 games, I believe this card is a no-brainer. You can easily sell the card for over $85 over the next couple of years if you decide you want to upgrade to something faster.

Keep in mind, claiming the free games requires a bit of effort, and it would be hard to sell the free games to anyone you don't know. Basically, I had to create an AMD rewards account to claim the games. The account has to detect the GPU installed in your system to claim the free games, so you can't simply sell the AMD key to someone else. Once the AMD activation site confirms your hardware, it allows you to choose 2 out of the 3 games available: Resident Evil 2, The Division 2, and Devil May Cry 5. Once those games are chosen, then the AMD account has to be tied to your Steam account to activate the game to the steam library. Again, it works with a willing friend, but it will be difficult to do if you plan on selling the keys to someone you don't know well.

All in all, I am really happy with this purchase. If crossfire was still worth using these days, I would buy another one and keep the bundled games for myself. It's that good of a deal.

A final thought, if you are interested in all 3 of the bundled games, the RX 590, Vega 56, Vega 64, and the upcoming Radeon VII come with all 3 games: effectively lowering the cost of those GPU's a staggering $180! If my friend could have waited a couple of weeks to play RE2, I would have waited for the Radeon VII's release. But he couldn't wait, and I'm still very satisfied that I jumped on a great deal!"

The card itself works well, to reassure anybody who might be on the fence or needs a video card as soon as possible. A replacement card for my now dead 970 from newegg arrived DoA (One of those 100 buck sapphire 470s), so, out of panic, knowing that my RMA would probably take something along the line of two weeks, I snatched one of these bad boys up at a small premium compared to the offers on other sites. It arrived swift, as per usual, and it plugged in and got working right away. Honestly, I love it, i'd say its right on par with my old 970 at a very agreeable price. To anyone who hasn't looked at in depth performance reviews, one of these cards is able to handle pretty much every recent game, except overly resource-hungry modern titles, at a comfortable 40-60+ fps depending on the setting of your choice and whether or not you add additional shaders. Coming from anything below a 970, whether it be an r9 series, 7xx, radeon xxxx, you should be rather satisfied with one of these cards. I recommend them especially at this price point. I'm not sure if it's posted anywhere on this product page or brought to attention well enough, but you do get a selection of two out of three games coming out soon, so assuming you're interested in the division 2, DMC5, or resident evil 2, this could potentially be a very smart move so you don't have to purchase those any more.

Small(large) edit: So, apparently I thought I was having issues with this thing once I switched to a 1440p monitor; however, there is a pretty gigantic quirk that I thought might bring light so some common complications with this card. This card is best for 1080p gaming, period. However, with 1440p it can work, but there is a bit of a complication with how AMD gpus tend to work in general lately, especially the Polaris line, which this card belongs to. You may notice that sometimes under intense load that your screen might flicker. This brought me no end of annoyance at first, but I discovered that you basically have to go into global settings (under ""Gaming"") with radeon's software and tab into wattman to do some editing. At the bare minimum, without any other adjustments, you need to adjust the power limit on this card to around +20%~ or more if it has to do any heavy lifting, otherwise it will throttle one way or another with differing symptoms. Amd has thrown out a bunch of efficiency software and tuning which end up under powering your card where it may need it in desperate times. This isn't overclocking, but this does actually allow for proper overclocking, if you don't wish to proceed any further than this, you don't need to. I'm not sure why they thought it would be wise to essentially choke this thing for power right out of the box, but it seems to be a reality. My card works as it should now 1440p, but do monitor temperatures with HW monitor, and adjust the fan speed curve as need be, just to be certain (My case has awful airflow). Wattman can be a fantastic utility, so utilize it!

Just be sure you have enough power to back the card up, I do fine @ 550W and an i5 6600k, but you should plan out your power usage just as a precaution. Knowledge is power!"

I had a decent price and a nice bump in graphics over my previous older card. But about 5 months after I got it we started having these system hang/crashes where the whole screen goes dark. The system was still on and had to be hard powered off to get it back up. This only happened during GPU heavy games needing to take the card above 50% capacity.

We tried to reinstall drives, reseat the card, reformat the OS, then adjust the settings. All of these failed to resolve the issue. We then thought it might be related to the CPU or its heatsinks so we put in a new motherboard, memory, and CPU. This also had no effect, so I go looking for this issue and low and behold I am not the first person to have this problem. So now we are getting a new card from a new company and not cheeping out on the price.

Not much better performance on 4k video editing while overclocking, don't really see a need. I play on HUGE maps, sandbox, galaxy, ect, no issues.
Putting 2 of these cards together in SLI, stock settings, out performed a 2080Ti for less than the 2080.
Just get it, or get 2 and be happy!"

Wow. So, first I’m going to fill you in on what I’m using so you can make the call yourself.

Dell Optiplex 990
I5-2500 3.3Ghz
Windows 7 Professional 64 bit
16GB memory ( 4x4gb 10600 1333mhz sticks- all same brand/model)
250gb HD
Lenovo 24” monitor 1080p

Upgraded from a 2gig ddr3 card and wow what a difference. I have yet to play a game that I couldn’t max out the graphics settings! This GPU isn’t all that loud, I only hear it becaus I have my case open. The OC option is great, it gives it a nice bump, but haven’t really had to use it unless I wanted to feel spoiled. I’m new to gaming and people say this is a mid range card, but to be honest it pushes out WAY more crisp graphics than my x box one S. The responsiveness is also great. I have yet to see the GPU clock higher than 60C even when the OC option is on. I don’t see a reason for the $1k graphics cards too be honest. This has shown all the power I need! Not to mention it is running on the motherboard and stock power supply of 250 something!

Game played with ultra/max settings.

The Witcher 3
FIFA 18
Endless Space 2
Metal Gear Solid 5 phantom pain
Arkham Knight GOTY edition
Far cry primal

GTA 5 on mix of medium/high
GR Wildlands on high/ultra (using OC with some tweaks in bios) even though some features load slow ie. terrain

Edited to add some games I’ve played on this card since I bought it.

-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE:

So when I first got this card I was a bit of a newbie when it came to gaming. This card is still a very good card! If your worried about FPS, I'm sorry, unless you have a beefy system with matching ddr5 memory to add as vram to the card, you won;t get it. The above games I was playing at lower resolutions, with higher settings. I was originally playing with the stock PSU on my pc, but have upgraded recently to 550W PSU. It has made this decent card into a better performing card! With the new PSU I was able to push the card a lot harder when I overclock and it did make a huge difference in how fast the images were rendered in game. The current games I play are below:

These unlike the last review are all on full screen 1080p.

Ghost Recon: Wildands --- Mostly medium settings with ultra texture levels. Average:35-42 FPS
FrostPunk: ALL Ultra settings ---- 40 FPS almost constantly
FIFA 18: Ultra/Max settings ---- 50 FPS plus
Sims 4---Ultra/Max everything-- does it really matter? lol its Sims. Walk in the park even without overclocking.
Fallout 4 GOTY-----High/Ultra mix -- without MODS in game it did well 45-55 FPS, with mods about 35
Batman: Arkham Origins- Max settings 50-55fps
Witcher 3---Mostly Ultra but with a few off or on low---45-50 fps
Splinter Cell:Blacklist-------Ultra preset in game ----50 FPS
This War of Mine-----Ultra Settings----40-45fps
MGS V----Ultra Settings 50 fps SOLID\

The card I think with a strong PSU can take on MUCH more than it can with a stock PSU. I thought about upgrading to the 1060 for future proofing, but I just can't seem to justify it yet :)

Even with only 2 GB VRAM on the card, this this is handling what I throw at it well."
Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TD5-4GD),Gigabyte,Nvidia,$156.06,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent graphics card that fits a HP 570 Series Pavilion PC!,"*This review is for the Geforce GTX 1050 Ti OC Low Profile 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TOC-4GL)*
I bought a small form factor HP 570-p064 (for $400) to be used for general, non-gaming use, but soon after I decided to upgrade the power supply and get the best graphics card that could fit in its cramped case. After hours of research, I found that the only card that would reasonably fit would be the Gigabyte GT 1030 -- a very flat, 2 GB GDDR5 card -- and I ordered it from Amazon for about $95.

So, I installed an EVGA uATX power supply and the card...But after less than a week of playing some old Steam games and demos, I was disappointed by how much it did not improve upon the integrated Intel HD 630 graphics. I believe I needed a 4 GB video card, although they were twice the size; it would be a miracle to find something that would work in a HP 570.

I just couldn't believe the GT 1030 could be the only option, but the PCI-E port is flanked by a power supply and a slimline DVD player. In addition, the motherboard's two yellow audio inputs are partially blocking the top graphics card slot -- a weird design choice. So, the prospect of installing any dual-slot, 4GB card would be limited by card length, height, and ""shape"": Basically, any ""blocky"" cards (like some of the EVGA models) longer than 6.8 inches would not work.

I thought that maybe this Gigabyte model would work, trying to measure and imagine it in my case. Well, I was lucky enough to find an obscure review from another HP 570 series purchaser (on another seller's website) who wrote that the Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti Low Profile graphics card ""barley fit."" It seemed that the length and height would be OK, and the sides might just perfectly angle near the front of the card to allow just enough space to clear the motherboard's audio inputs.

Well, I chatted with Amazon about the situation and they took care of anything -- FIVE STARS for customer service! They sent me a new 1050 Ti graphics card via free one-day shipping, and they said there would be no penalty if the card didn't fit. And they helped me return the GT 1030. Thank you Amazon once again!

I was very happy when my new GPU installed perfectly, and I got started sampling some games.

My HP 570-p064 only has an Intel i3 dual-core 7100 3.9GHZ processor with 8 GB DDR4 RAM. Windows 10 64-bit is on an SSD, and my games are installed on a 1 TB hard drive. I am limited to a 23"" 1080p 60 Hz monitor. Here are some of my in-game FPS results with the Gigabyte 1050 Ti OC -- with some slight overclocking -- using 1080p resolution:

- Grand Theft Auto V with high settings and some effects: 50-60 FPS average
- Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition with high settings: 60 FPS
- Final Fantasy: A Realm Reborn with high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Max Payne 3 with very high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Doom (2016) with max resolution and medium effects: 60 FPS
- Spec Ops: The Line (demo) with the highest settings: a solid 60 FPS
- Skyrim with ultra settings running high definition textures: 60 FPS

I hope this review helps anyone with an HP 570 series computer make a sizable graphics card upgrade. Although it's more of a casual gaming card, I believe it can play games on par -- or better in many cases -- than a regular PS4. Your success will largely depend on your processor, too, and I have an average Intel unit.

Please note you'll need a new power supply as this card draws 70 watts, and the stock 180-watt power supply will not work safely, if at all. I recommend the EVGA 500 watt White model. And if someone finds an even better GPU that fits an HP 570, please let the world know."

RGB works fine as long as you're not plugging it into a $20 motherboard. Anyway, this card gives me my frames and resolution, I'm happy. But remember, CPU has a big impact on your FPS performance, as well. So don't judge my frames just based off of the fact that I have this card (the 1050 G1 Gaming 2GB). I have an i5-7600k paired with this 1050.

PUBG - 60-100 FPS tweaked graphics settings

Rust - 90 - 110 FPS
League of Legends - 150 to 300 FPS, although I hate this game so don't ask me anything more about it
Fornite - 130-180 FPS ( hate this game too)

Anyway, you get the jist. I got it for ~$40 less than it's listed at right now; so I'm definitely satisfied. Cheap and great for casual performance. 4 stars simply because of the inherent product quality, (it's just a 1050), and the fact that it's gone up ~$40. Would have given it 5 stars because of the great value to performance if it was still sitting at the cheaper price!"

Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TD5-4GD),Gigabyte,Nvidia,$156.06,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Did Not Expect It,"I refurbish computers in my free time and lately I've been getting requests to upgrade my computers into entry level gaming computers.

The first card I purchased was a GeForce GT1030 2G, but only because the size of the computer didn't allow for a larger card. Then, I purchased the GT1050 Ti to test for upcoming builds and I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's get one big thing out of the way. This card is not top of the line and is not intended for serious gamers. Having said that, for beginners or someone that needs a decent upgrade from an integrated graphics card then this card is what I recommend.

I play a decent amount of Civilization V and City Skylines. On medium settings I'm averaging roughly 50 fps. Granted, I have a 500gb SSD, 1TB HDD and 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAM with an i5 processor. So, if you have less memory or a slower processor you may not get the same results. I'm betting if I doubled my RAM I could probably squeak out a bit more fps.

Seriously, if you're a newbie to gaming or just want an affordable upgrade to your current graphics, I recommend you take a look at this card. It does NOT require additional power and I run my card through a Dell desktop. Anyone that knows Dell computers knows that their PSUs don't have that much juice. However, after upgrading to a EVGA 600w PSU today, my fps went up slightly to around 55fps."

Since installing the card, I have been able to crank up the settings (9 in WoW, Ultra in OW) while maintaining decent FPS (60). Great introdution to Nvidea and it was a breeze to install. I installed it on my lunch break from work and still had plenty of time to eat and get a QP game in. I did take a star away due to the fan being pretty loud but it's not a dealbreaker for me since I use my headset most of the time."
Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TD5-4GD),Gigabyte,Nvidia,$156.06,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget gaming GPU,"Good budget gaming GPU. It works at 1870 MHz (Core) and 3504 MHz (memory) from the box. Was able to overclock it to 1930 MHz (core) and 4504 MHz(memory). It is enough to play almost all games on ultra settings. Though, on 1080p monitors, in some games, you will have to reduce some options as filtering/shadows in order to get 60 fps (e.g. in the Witcher 3). Use it w/ i5-7500, 8GB Crucial 2400 MHz and 120GB Transcend SSD.
In conclusion: good enough for 1080p monitors. If you cannot afford going for higher GPUs like RX 470 or GTX 1060, but this GPU. In my case, I use this GPU with 900p monitor and it provides a comfortable gaming at 60-90 fps w/ ultra setting in heavy games like GTA V, Battlefield 1, Witcher 3, Assasins Creed and others."
Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TD5-4GD),Gigabyte,Nvidia,$156.06,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great low profile card that performs very well!,"I bought this for my HP Compaq Elite 8300 SFF that I bought a couple of years ago because I wanted a ""gaming"" machine and the Intel HD 2500 integrated graphics isn't exactly great. I thought I might have a tough time finding something to upgrade it with because the power supply is only 240W and it's a very ""special"" one that has a special shape and can't be upgraded... unless I were to move everything into a new case and I'm not that confident in my abilities. Anyway, installing this wasn't that hard to do because it fits very well and the AORUS software used to control it is nice and easy to use. Everything I've thrown at it so far has worked wonderfully. Of course not all of the most recent games will work of course.

The only thing that I didn't like was that I was sent an email after purchase for the ""Fortnite Bundle"" and while I don't play it, I thought I'd give it a try after redeeming the code they sent me....Well...the code had already been redeemed and Nvidia told me the email that redeemed it and it looked to be a Russian email that had redeemed it weeks before I even purchased this. They told me to contact Amazon for a new code. I did just that and the support was awful. They kept transferring me back and forth over 10 times and basically told me to contact ""the developer"" which I asked them to clarify and they said to contact Gigabyte. I did THAT and was told to contact Amazon or Nvidia. So that was all pointless. If you're buying this for an upgrade, go for it. If you're buying this and you want the Fortnite promotion, you won't get it which is pretty scummy if you ask me."

The plan was to code on one and review documents, specs on the other. Plugged into the system and powered up. Fan on Graphics card was operational, but the screens remained black for several minutes. Eventually the screens turned off due to 'No Signal'. Tried 3 different HDMI cables and the DVI cable, with no luck.

Then I got the idea to plug one of the monitors into the onboard VGA cable and verified the OS was booted. Opened the device manager and saw the card was not compatible with the Microsoft Basic Video Driver. Loaded the drivers from the CD that came with the product and all seemed good. The driver CD required a reboot to complete installation and here is where the problem began.

Upon reboot, Windows 10 crashed due to corrupted files. Rebooted twice with the same problem. Finally Windows executed the automatic recovery which removed the Video card drivers. Once I booted into Windows, I tried again, but this time I downloaded the driver straight from the Website. Upon reboot, Windows reported corrupted files and crashed. This time, the automatic recovery program could not recovery and my whole OS was corrupted. I spent a day and a half reinstalling the OS, the drivers, the updates, and all the programs I had lost on my system.

Tech support was no help. Even asked if I had the outlet plugged into the desktop and the system was powered up. I decided to just return the item to Kohl's for a refund."

This card is amazing, if you’re looking to upgrade old parts and don’t have $500 laying around like a lot of people, but this one.

While the card itself is good, I've wasted an hour trying to get the bonus. I received an email from Amazon with a code and web link. I followed the link, had to give lots of personal information to create an account at GeForce, to finally get to the proper page. After entering the very long code and the ""I'm not a robot"" validation, it gave a cryptic message ""Please use GeForce Experience 3.17 to redeem this promo code. You can download it at <redacted link at NVIDIA>. I have no idea what that is, why I need it, or why I wasn't sent there to begin with. So, I went to *that* link, downloaded it, went through a time-consuming install, which *seemed* to complete. Then I started it (but it seems to report it as an older version 3.10.x, although Add/Remove programs only shows 3.6.0.74) and (after quite a wait) it reported another useless message of ""NVIDIA Installer failed"" and a link for ""Need help troubleshooting?""

When I go to *that* link, I get an Amazon page displaying 129 items that reference ""Fortnite bundle"" ... no help at all for anything related to my issue.

So, if you want a video card, consider this only as if you won't get any bonus with it. I've lost way too much time trying to get the ""bonus"". It's not worth it."

Now that the mining craze has settled down, these cards are an excellent price for what they offer.

NOTE: The ""Windforce OC Edition"" requires a 6-pin power cable that is not included. I got mine to work just fine with a cheap 4-pin Molex to 6-pin adapter. If your PSU has no unused connectors, either buy the smaller version of the card that doesn't require the additional 6-pin connection or upgrade your PSU.

It seems when the cards work, they work great being an Nvidia GeForce 1050 GPU. However lately they have been crashing while performing 3D gaming duties. The monitor loses signal and cannot recover. The sound proves that the game is still going; the game did not crash.

I monitored heat, ran GPU burner programs, tried different drivers to no avail. The heat plateaus off at safe levels; the GPU programs cannot replicate the issues; the behavior doesn't change with different driver versions or different games. Currently, I am trying to work with Gigabyte for warranty replacement on both cards. Yes, both cards.

Update 1/25/2019:
I received both cards back from Gigabyte --untouched-- with a packing list (yes, packing list; nothing else) that hinted both cards were out of region. When I submitted the cards for RMA, they stated only one was out of region. Now they say BOTH are out of region. Their 3-year warranty is absolute crap when they won't stand by their product. I will throw these in the trash and go a different brand. You have been warned."

Its a simple upgade!","First off lets look what I'm using this in: A old Walmart ""box"" Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer. With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.

Playing what would be considered ""simple single and multi-player games"" with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.

Well this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking ""CPU"" power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now ""booking"" on all my games and simulators!

The GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.

I currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.

So far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.

All in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer."

Installed in about 5 minutes,"Got the card today and working great. Installed in about 5 minutes. Probably would of installed quicker but I spent about 2 minutes looking for the pin jacks for the power supply. (someone in the Q&A said that this card (with 2 fans has to be plugged into the power supply). It doesn't. No connections anywhere on card for separate power supply connection on the card , the whole thing is powered just by sliding it into the PCI e slot. When I first installed the card and turned on PC it used a generic windows driver for about 5 minutes until windows update immediately downloaded and installed the driver from Nvida. One thing, the driver that Windows 10 pulled was pretty old and out of date so you will most certainly want to download the software and run it. I just googled the card name, took me right to their website where you can download a program from Nvida called (GeForce Experience) that will auto detect your card, and download the very latest driver, you can also select in the settings to auto update the driver as new versions come out.

Ran some stress tests on it (not very long about 10 minutes or maybe less, but temp of the card never went over 64 degrees C which is very good. Stress test is designed to push the card to the limits and if the card doesn't run super hot your in good shape. Runs at a steady 32-33 degrees in my computer when not gaming and just using internet and basic windows programs.

Overall I think this card is great value for mid range gaming on the newest games, and any of the older favorites should run at top settings. Also this card has sound drivers built in. Which kind of shocked me. My old card didn't and I was using headphones for the longest time. I was kind of shocked when all the sudden my monitor started having sound come out of it. I didn't even know my monitor had speakers built in to be honest.lol"

I've tried every troubleshooting option, changed settings, replaced drivers, everything I could think of and everything I could find online. Finally in January of this year I sent the card in, hoping they'd fix or replace it, but it was returned with the note that they couldn't find a problem.

All I wanted was a reliable low-profile graphics card that would fit in my slim PC case. What I got was a lemon that's been nothing but a pain from the beginning. It works, but only just enough to get my hopes up before eventually flickering, going black, and requiring yet another reboot."

Wow. So, first I’m going to fill you in on what I’m using so you can make the call yourself.

Dell Optiplex 990
I5-2500 3.3Ghz
Windows 7 Professional 64 bit
16GB memory ( 4x4gb 10600 1333mhz sticks- all same brand/model)
250gb HD
Lenovo 24” monitor 1080p

Upgraded from a 2gig ddr3 card and wow what a difference. I have yet to play a game that I couldn’t max out the graphics settings! This GPU isn’t all that loud, I only hear it becaus I have my case open. The OC option is great, it gives it a nice bump, but haven’t really had to use it unless I wanted to feel spoiled. I’m new to gaming and people say this is a mid range card, but to be honest it pushes out WAY more crisp graphics than my x box one S. The responsiveness is also great. I have yet to see the GPU clock higher than 60C even when the OC option is on. I don’t see a reason for the $1k graphics cards too be honest. This has shown all the power I need! Not to mention it is running on the motherboard and stock power supply of 250 something!

Game played with ultra/max settings.

The Witcher 3
FIFA 18
Endless Space 2
Metal Gear Solid 5 phantom pain
Arkham Knight GOTY edition
Far cry primal

GTA 5 on mix of medium/high
GR Wildlands on high/ultra (using OC with some tweaks in bios) even though some features load slow ie. terrain

Edited to add some games I’ve played on this card since I bought it.

-----------------------------------------------------
UPDATE:

So when I first got this card I was a bit of a newbie when it came to gaming. This card is still a very good card! If your worried about FPS, I'm sorry, unless you have a beefy system with matching ddr5 memory to add as vram to the card, you won;t get it. The above games I was playing at lower resolutions, with higher settings. I was originally playing with the stock PSU on my pc, but have upgraded recently to 550W PSU. It has made this decent card into a better performing card! With the new PSU I was able to push the card a lot harder when I overclock and it did make a huge difference in how fast the images were rendered in game. The current games I play are below:

These unlike the last review are all on full screen 1080p.

Ghost Recon: Wildands --- Mostly medium settings with ultra texture levels. Average:35-42 FPS
FrostPunk: ALL Ultra settings ---- 40 FPS almost constantly
FIFA 18: Ultra/Max settings ---- 50 FPS plus
Sims 4---Ultra/Max everything-- does it really matter? lol its Sims. Walk in the park even without overclocking.
Fallout 4 GOTY-----High/Ultra mix -- without MODS in game it did well 45-55 FPS, with mods about 35
Batman: Arkham Origins- Max settings 50-55fps
Witcher 3---Mostly Ultra but with a few off or on low---45-50 fps
Splinter Cell:Blacklist-------Ultra preset in game ----50 FPS
This War of Mine-----Ultra Settings----40-45fps
MGS V----Ultra Settings 50 fps SOLID\

The card I think with a strong PSU can take on MUCH more than it can with a stock PSU. I thought about upgrading to the 1060 for future proofing, but I just can't seem to justify it yet :)

Even with only 2 GB VRAM on the card, this this is handling what I throw at it well."
MSI VGA Graphic Cards RX 580 ARMOR 8G OC,MSI COMPUTER,AMD Radeon RX 580,$237.51,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent graphics card that fits a HP 570 Series Pavilion PC!,"*This review is for the Geforce GTX 1050 Ti OC Low Profile 4GB GDDR5 128 Bit PCI-E Graphic Card (GV-N105TOC-4GL)*
I bought a small form factor HP 570-p064 (for $400) to be used for general, non-gaming use, but soon after I decided to upgrade the power supply and get the best graphics card that could fit in its cramped case. After hours of research, I found that the only card that would reasonably fit would be the Gigabyte GT 1030 -- a very flat, 2 GB GDDR5 card -- and I ordered it from Amazon for about $95.

So, I installed an EVGA uATX power supply and the card...But after less than a week of playing some old Steam games and demos, I was disappointed by how much it did not improve upon the integrated Intel HD 630 graphics. I believe I needed a 4 GB video card, although they were twice the size; it would be a miracle to find something that would work in a HP 570.

I just couldn't believe the GT 1030 could be the only option, but the PCI-E port is flanked by a power supply and a slimline DVD player. In addition, the motherboard's two yellow audio inputs are partially blocking the top graphics card slot -- a weird design choice. So, the prospect of installing any dual-slot, 4GB card would be limited by card length, height, and ""shape"": Basically, any ""blocky"" cards (like some of the EVGA models) longer than 6.8 inches would not work.

I thought that maybe this Gigabyte model would work, trying to measure and imagine it in my case. Well, I was lucky enough to find an obscure review from another HP 570 series purchaser (on another seller's website) who wrote that the Gigabyte Geforce GTX 1050 Ti Low Profile graphics card ""barley fit."" It seemed that the length and height would be OK, and the sides might just perfectly angle near the front of the card to allow just enough space to clear the motherboard's audio inputs.

Well, I chatted with Amazon about the situation and they took care of anything -- FIVE STARS for customer service! They sent me a new 1050 Ti graphics card via free one-day shipping, and they said there would be no penalty if the card didn't fit. And they helped me return the GT 1030. Thank you Amazon once again!

I was very happy when my new GPU installed perfectly, and I got started sampling some games.

My HP 570-p064 only has an Intel i3 dual-core 7100 3.9GHZ processor with 8 GB DDR4 RAM. Windows 10 64-bit is on an SSD, and my games are installed on a 1 TB hard drive. I am limited to a 23"" 1080p 60 Hz monitor. Here are some of my in-game FPS results with the Gigabyte 1050 Ti OC -- with some slight overclocking -- using 1080p resolution:

- Grand Theft Auto V with high settings and some effects: 50-60 FPS average
- Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition with high settings: 60 FPS
- Final Fantasy: A Realm Reborn with high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Max Payne 3 with very high settings and high effects: 60 FPS
- Doom (2016) with max resolution and medium effects: 60 FPS
- Spec Ops: The Line (demo) with the highest settings: a solid 60 FPS
- Skyrim with ultra settings running high definition textures: 60 FPS

I hope this review helps anyone with an HP 570 series computer make a sizable graphics card upgrade. Although it's more of a casual gaming card, I believe it can play games on par -- or better in many cases -- than a regular PS4. Your success will largely depend on your processor, too, and I have an average Intel unit.

Please note you'll need a new power supply as this card draws 70 watts, and the stock 180-watt power supply will not work safely, if at all. I recommend the EVGA 500 watt White model. And if someone finds an even better GPU that fits an HP 570, please let the world know."

Fans and temps, no problems. Does exactly what it's supposed to do plus some for a measly 1050 since it's Gigabyte overclocked. XTREME GIGABYTE Engine is a little clunky, but it works. RGB works fine as long as you're not plugging it into a $20 motherboard. Anyway, this card gives me my frames and resolution, I'm happy. But remember, CPU has a big impact on your FPS performance, as well. So don't judge my frames just based off of the fact that I have this card (the 1050 G1 Gaming 2GB). I have an i5-7600k paired with this 1050.

1920x1080 jenky 60hz monitor;
CS: GO - Average 300 frames on tweaked medium/high graphic settings
PUBG - 60-100 FPS tweaked graphics settings
H1Z1 - A very stable 90 fps (just got it, may have capped fps setting somewhere i don't know about)
Rust - 90 - 110 FPS
League of Legends - 150 to 300 FPS, although I hate this game so don't ask me anything more about it
Fornite - 130-180 FPS ( hate this game too)

Anyway, you get the jist. I got it for ~$40 less than it's listed at right now; so I'm definitely satisfied. Cheap and great for casual performance. 4 stars simply because of the inherent product quality, (it's just a 1050), and the fact that it's gone up ~$40. Would have given it 5 stars because of the great value to performance if it was still sitting at the cheaper price!"

MSI VGA Graphic Cards RX 580 ARMOR 8G OC,MSI COMPUTER,AMD Radeon RX 580,$237.51,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Did Not Expect It,"I refurbish computers in my free time and lately I've been getting requests to upgrade my computers into entry level gaming computers.

The first card I purchased was a GeForce GT1030 2G, but only because the size of the computer didn't allow for a larger card. Then, I purchased the GT1050 Ti to test for upcoming builds and I was pleasantly surprised.

Let's get one big thing out of the way. This card is not top of the line and is not intended for serious gamers. Having said that, for beginners or someone that needs a decent upgrade from an integrated graphics card then this card is what I recommend.

I play a decent amount of Civilization V and City Skylines. On medium settings I'm averaging roughly 50 fps. Granted, I have a 500gb SSD, 1TB HDD and 16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAM with an i5 processor. So, if you have less memory or a slower processor you may not get the same results. I'm betting if I doubled my RAM I could probably squeak out a bit more fps.

Seriously, if you're a newbie to gaming or just want an affordable upgrade to your current graphics, I recommend you take a look at this card. It does NOT require additional power and I run my card through a Dell desktop. Anyone that knows Dell computers knows that their PSUs don't have that much juice. However, after upgrading to a EVGA 600w PSU today, my fps went up slightly to around 55fps."

My gaming consists of Blizzard games (WoW, OW, HotS, and Diablo) which aren't too demanding for decent settings. Since installing the card, I have been able to crank up the settings (9 in WoW, Ultra in OW) while maintaining decent FPS (60). Great introdution to Nvidea and it was a breeze to install. I installed it on my lunch break from work and still had plenty of time to eat and get a QP game in. I did take a star away due to the fan being pretty loud but it's not a dealbreaker for me since I use my headset most of the time."

It works at 1870 MHz (Core) and 3504 MHz (memory) from the box. Was able to overclock it to 1930 MHz (core) and 4504 MHz(memory). It is enough to play almost all games on ultra settings. Though, on 1080p monitors, in some games, you will have to reduce some options as filtering/shadows in order to get 60 fps (e.g. in the Witcher 3). Use it w/ i5-7500, 8GB Crucial 2400 MHz and 120GB Transcend SSD.
In conclusion: good enough for 1080p monitors. If you cannot afford going for higher GPUs like RX 470 or GTX 1060, but this GPU. In my case, I use this GPU with 900p monitor and it provides a comfortable gaming at 60-90 fps w/ ultra setting in heavy games like GTA V, Battlefield 1, Witcher 3, Assasins Creed and others."
MSI VGA Graphic Cards RX 580 ARMOR 8G OC,MSI COMPUTER,AMD Radeon RX 580,$237.51,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great low profile card that performs very well!,"I bought this for my HP Compaq Elite 8300 SFF that I bought a couple of years ago because I wanted a ""gaming"" machine and the Intel HD 2500 integrated graphics isn't exactly great. I thought I might have a tough time finding something to upgrade it with because the power supply is only 240W and it's a very ""special"" one that has a special shape and can't be upgraded... unless I were to move everything into a new case and I'm not that confident in my abilities. Anyway, installing this wasn't that hard to do because it fits very well and the AORUS software used to control it is nice and easy to use. Everything I've thrown at it so far has worked wonderfully. Of course not all of the most recent games will work of course.

The only thing that I didn't like was that I was sent an email after purchase for the ""Fortnite Bundle"" and while I don't play it, I thought I'd give it a try after redeeming the code they sent me....Well...the code had already been redeemed and Nvidia told me the email that redeemed it and it looked to be a Russian email that had redeemed it weeks before I even purchased this. They told me to contact Amazon for a new code. I did just that and the support was awful. They kept transferring me back and forth over 10 times and basically told me to contact ""the developer"" which I asked them to clarify and they said to contact Gigabyte. I did THAT and was told to contact Amazon or Nvidia. So that was all pointless. If you're buying this for an upgrade, go for it. If you're buying this and you want the Fortnite promotion, you won't get it which is pretty scummy if you ask me."

The plan was to code on one and review documents, specs on the other. Plugged into the system and powered up. Fan on Graphics card was operational, but the screens remained black for several minutes. Eventually the screens turned off due to 'No Signal'. Tried 3 different HDMI cables and the DVI cable, with no luck.

Then I got the idea to plug one of the monitors into the onboard VGA cable and verified the OS was booted. Opened the device manager and saw the card was not compatible with the Microsoft Basic Video Driver. Loaded the drivers from the CD that came with the product and all seemed good. The driver CD required a reboot to complete installation and here is where the problem began.

Upon reboot, Windows 10 crashed due to corrupted files. Rebooted twice with the same problem. Finally Windows executed the automatic recovery which removed the Video card drivers. Once I booted into Windows, I tried again, but this time I downloaded the driver straight from the Website. Upon reboot, Windows reported corrupted files and crashed. This time, the automatic recovery program could not recovery and my whole OS was corrupted. I spent a day and a half reinstalling the OS, the drivers, the updates, and all the programs I had lost on my system.

Tech support was no help. Even asked if I had the outlet plugged into the desktop and the system was powered up. I decided to just return the item to Kohl's for a refund."

Great upgrade.,"Ok, so you’re reading this review wondering about whether or not to spend your money. I did the same, and i shouldn’t have waited as long as i did to buy this. 1) My Pc was terrible. it still is terrible. it’s a prebuilt from like 8 years ago and if you know anything about pc gaming you know how slow old gaming builds are. 2) i don’t have a monitor. i play on an old flatscreen Tv from, again, like 8 years ago. 3) cards are expensive as all hell. i don’t make steamer casse i’m a casual player, but i still want a mediocre setup.
This card is amazing, if you’re looking to upgrade old parts and don’t have $500 laying around like a lot of people, but this one. If you’re not good with computers and are afraid of having to put one in yourself, it’s simple plug and play. there are thousands of youtube videos that show you how. i don’t know computers. i’m a grease monkey i work on cars. it took me 5 minutes and one screw driver.

obviously if you’re looking for some massive quality upgrade and 144 hz monitor, 3000$ Pc , then no this isn’t for you. but if you’re like me, and want some decent quality of life upgrades, buy this."

While the card itself is good, I've wasted an hour trying to get the bonus. I received an email from Amazon with a code and web link. I followed the link, had to give lots of personal information to create an account at GeForce, to finally get to the proper page. After entering the very long code and the ""I'm not a robot"" validation, it gave a cryptic message ""Please use GeForce Experience 3.17 to redeem this promo code. You can download it at <redacted link at NVIDIA>. I have no idea what that is, why I need it, or why I wasn't sent there to begin with. So, I went to *that* link, downloaded it, went through a time-consuming install, which *seemed* to complete. Then I started it (but it seems to report it as an older version 3.10.x, although Add/Remove programs only shows 3.6.0.74) and (after quite a wait) it reported another useless message of ""NVIDIA Installer failed"" and a link for ""Need help troubleshooting?""

When I go to *that* link, I get an Amazon page displaying 129 items that reference ""Fortnite bundle"" ... no help at all for anything related to my issue.

So, if you want a video card, consider this only as if you won't get any bonus with it. I've lost way too much time trying to get the ""bonus"". It's not worth it."

Now that the mining craze has settled down, these cards are an excellent price for what they offer.

NOTE: The ""Windforce OC Edition"" requires a 6-pin power cable that is not included. I got mine to work just fine with a cheap 4-pin Molex to 6-pin adapter. If your PSU has no unused connectors, either buy the smaller version of the card that doesn't require the additional 6-pin connection or upgrade your PSU.

MSI VGA Graphic Cards RX 580 ARMOR 8G OC,MSI COMPUTER,AMD Radeon RX 580,$237.51,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buy a different brand,"Bought two, one in April and one in May. Both are now failing during 3D gaming operations.

It seems when the cards work, they work great being an Nvidia GeForce 1050 GPU. However lately they have been crashing while performing 3D gaming duties. The monitor loses signal and cannot recover. The sound proves that the game is still going; the game did not crash.

I monitored heat, ran GPU burner programs, tried different drivers to no avail. The heat plateaus off at safe levels; the GPU programs cannot replicate the issues; the behavior doesn't change with different driver versions or different games. Currently, I am trying to work with Gigabyte for warranty replacement on both cards. Yes, both cards.

Update 1/25/2019:
I received both cards back from Gigabyte --untouched-- with a packing list (yes, packing list; nothing else) that hinted both cards were out of region. When I submitted the cards for RMA, they stated only one was out of region. Now they say BOTH are out of region. Their 3-year warranty is absolute crap when they won't stand by their product. I will throw these in the trash and go a different brand. You have been warned."

Its a simple upgade!","First off lets look what I'm using this in: A old Walmart ""box"" Dell Inspiron 560 computer (2009 era) with the Intel e5400 CPU; 10 Gig Ram, Win10 and stock 300 Watt power supply. This by NO means a powerhouse of a computer. With the on-board graphics being only good for the most basic of games and videos, we moved to upgrade the video to a Nvidia GT 520 (2011 era). One of the limiting factors with video cards is the power supply in the computer having enough power. Back then the GT 520 fit the bill only requiring 300W. This card worked fine until games became more graphic heavy.

Playing what would be considered ""simple single and multi-player games"" with my son (he has a gaming computer) was more of a aggravation then enjoyment. Games like; Flight Simulator, Spin Tires, Euro Truck Simulator, Modern Warfare 2 (all on Steam) would suffer along on only the lowest of settings.

Well this Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1050 has changed all that. Now these games are running smooth and quick. It's like having a whole new computer, even with the lacking ""CPU"" power. With the Video settings on High, I'm now ""booking"" on all my games and simulators!

The GTX 1050 requires only 300W power so no issues there. It does take the space of an extra slot in the back out your PC case, but does push right in to the board with no extra wiring. The fans are quite when the run.

I currently run two monitors, one on HDMI and one with the DVI-D (using a converter to VGA). There is a DP (display port) connector for my third monitor Ill be getting soon.

So far the only lacking is the Utility Program - kinda slow to open but does have different settings you can play this like over-clocking, fan speed, etc.

All in all, this is a great card for the price and a perfect upgrade for a older computer."

Installed in about 5 minutes,"Got the card today and working great. Installed in about 5 minutes. Probably would of installed quicker but I spent about 2 minutes looking for the pin jacks for the power supply. (someone in the Q&A said that this card (with 2 fans has to be plugged into the power supply). It doesn't. No connections anywhere on card for separate power supply connection on the card , the whole thing is powered just by sliding it into the PCI e slot. When I first installed the card and turned on PC it used a generic windows driver for about 5 minutes until windows update immediately downloaded and installed the driver from Nvida. One thing, the driver that Windows 10 pulled was pretty old and out of date so you will most certainly want to download the software and run it. I just googled the card name, took me right to their website where you can download a program from Nvida called (GeForce Experience) that will auto detect your card, and download the very latest driver, you can also select in the settings to auto update the driver as new versions come out.

Ran some stress tests on it (not very long about 10 minutes or maybe less, but temp of the card never went over 64 degrees C which is very good. Stress test is designed to push the card to the limits and if the card doesn't run super hot your in good shape. Runs at a steady 32-33 degrees in my computer when not gaming and just using internet and basic windows programs.

Overall I think this card is great value for mid range gaming on the newest games, and any of the older favorites should run at top settings. Also this card has sound drivers built in. Which kind of shocked me. My old card didn't and I was using headphones for the longest time. I was kind of shocked when all the sudden my monitor started having sound come out of it. I didn't even know my monitor had speakers built in to be honest.lol"

I haven't noticed the fan at all and running the utility shows it taking my gaming load in stride.
I replaced an R9 380 3G with this and the 8G memory lets me use better settings and stuff sparkles for a month or so till I adjust and start dreaming of the next GPU upgrade on a limited budget. :)

I always choose as much ram as possible for my budget for PC's and GPU's when selecting.
I had medium/high expectations(within reason) and it delivered. I'm a happy camper.
I got way more than I had, at less than I spent for the R9 a while ago. ""Ohhhhh shiny!"" :)

EDIT: 2019 March 1.
I removed 3 stars because the ""RX 580"" has serious issues @ 4k across all brands.

I have 2 Intel Z77 mobo's that do 4k@60Hz no problem on my display.
The RX 580 in my Intel Z77 mobo's causes POST errors. I wish I had checked that out first!
I have an Intel H390 mobo that does 4k@60Hz no problems.
I have an AMD R9 380X 3G that does 4k@60Hz no problem.
I can't even get 4k@30Hz, 1/2 of what is advertised, many others complain about 'only 4k@30Hz'.
I have tried lots of different cables after searching the net for answers, no go.
I have beefy power supplies in everything, it's NOT a power issue.
Evidently I am now among the growing hoard of unhappy RX 580 customers.

If you are lucky, as some are, you MAY get 4k @ 30Hz out of it.
If all you want/need is 1080P and have no immediate plans for a UHD/4k monitor, it works OK.

I don't even want to use the term ""budget""","with the right CPU and 16 gig of at least 2400 ram you can run almost any brand new Triple A title on Ultra!!! It's also much easier to find, and cheaper to buy the monitors that go with AMD ""freesync"" I believe is it's name, than to try and find a nice monitor with G-Sync, and I'm a sucker for a 35"" ultra wide!! I can't even play on a normal 16:9 anymore

This may not be a popular opinion... and I don't know if it's the type of games I play or what, but I get comparable game benchmarks using a rx580 8gig paired with a RYZEN 17x or 18X, as I do with 8th gen I7 with a GTX 1070 (founders edition). The latter usually comes out a little ahead but not by a noticeable amount, and it darn well BETTER come out ahead! those components are almost twice the price. I do get more screen tearing on the harder games with the nVidia even if the FPS is a little higher due to all my monitors being AMD friendly. Personally id rather have average's in the 50-60 FPS with NO screen tearing, than 60-80 FPS with noticeable tearing"
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great budget card,"COOLING::: I built my first PC with this card, it has performed great so far! If you are worried about temperatures, they are not great, but not had either. The fan runs no higher than around 40% under a decent load for me, and is fairly quiet. When the card is idle, the temperature is around 54°C and under load gets to a maximum of around 77°C.(measured using msi afterburner.) If you want to lower the temps, you can always increase fan speed, at the cost of a bit of noise(it gets loud when the fans are anywhere over 45%) and will easily keep it in the 60°c-65°c under load.

GAMING::: it's great, you should easily stay above 60 fps in modern AAA games no problem, turning the settings down will let you get 144 fps and up(what I use with my 144hz monitor)

I recommend this card if you are on a budget, want to play new AAA titles, and are okay with some noise under heavy loads."

All 3 monitors are running beautifully, I also have the Pro drivers installed for Opencl support in Darktable and GIMP. They are running faster and smoother. Even with the Pro Drivers FPS is good in the light gaming that also happens in this machine. This GPU was a great price and has had great performance.

Just wondering, did anyone receive their code for their games yet? I haven't yet and am wondering about it (want to get Resident Evil 2 which releases in late January).

Wow, what can I say but wow, amazing upgrade to my now 6 year old custom build PC. Spent less than $200 (after pending rebate) for a major increase in graphics performance (coming from a GTX 670 which was a top performer in its class when I bought it years ago lol). Very nice looking and sturdy gpu that runs more quiet than any of my older cards. Bought it mainly so that I could run my new LG Ultrawide 3440 x 1440 monitor with no worries (working magically so far!), and then discovered the amazingness that is 21:9 gaming! I've seen a few videos on it but never really intended that for this card, but just wow, the higher level of immersion that I am experiencing at 3440 x 1440 is just incredible, and this card runs at that resolution for Final Fantasy XV (demo) with no issues, and I feel looks a lot better than I remember it when I played the game on PS4 ^_^. My large and mostly unplayed library of Steam games are old and pretty much NO game will even tax this card, thus downloading the Final Fantasy XV demo.

Idle temp was 30 C 85 F and fan was off. Would turn on and gradually increase speed to keep card cool. I wouldn't recommend it for 4K as it gets into the high 70s C 170 F. That is still within reasonable temperature for the card, but I personally would like to have my computer a long time. At 1080 everything looks great still and no components get above 60 C 140 F.

Paired with ryzen 5 2600x. Goal was to play any current and triple a games at a minimum of 1080p @60fps (nothing too special but good enough for the person who is transitioning from console to pc). First was skeptical because alot of reviews were saying it runs hot. But so far any games I throw at it, with visuals crank up high, it never went above 72° C. I have 1 intake 120mm fan and 2 exhaust 120mm fans (one top, one back), and stock wraith cpu cooler. Good for 60fps+ @1080p on high settings.

AMD FreeSync looks nice, too, given your monitor supports it. This card is an excellent value and will give you the most fps if you have $200 to spend on a card.

Cons: Imagine you put a horse saddle on a Boeing 747 jet engine and tried it ride it around your house... That's what noise this card makes. Okay, maybe not as loud as a jet but let's just say I can walk in other rooms of my house and still hear the thing. On a moderate overclock, it's very loud. On stock settings, it's still loud, but bearable. I don't think my card is defective, just doesn't have a heat sync up to par with a card like the Gaming X. Other than this, the card sags a tiny bit. You can remedy this by routing it's 8 pin power cable from above instead of below - that's what I did.

Overall, it's a great card if you can handle the noise. I think I'm going to return it and bump my card budget up to $300 to get something a bit quieter. If your budget is firm at $200, though, go ahead and jump on this card - the noise can be gotten used to and you won't regret the performance you get."

The packaging is nice and minimal but keeps the card nice and safe. I'm convinced I could kick the box and not phase the card.

It has nice little handouts that explain how to install; which is extremely easy but was helpful none-the-less. The GPU came with a driver installation CD, I don't have a CD drive in my PC (I haven't seen a CD in ages!) but it's helpful for those with poor or no internet. Driver installation was a breeze.

As far as performance, it has given me great increases in all games.

I play Destiny 2 and GTA V the most, 1080p High to Max settings, with my 960 I would get around 45 to 75FPS (AVG 50) in both games, with the 580 I saw more 55FPS up to 75FPS (AVG 60FPS). The only problem I have had with this card is heat, a lot of people have a problem with that and it's a simple solution, upgrade from an mATX case to a full ATX case. It's a big card so it needs to breathe. You can see better performance if you use afterburner and OC clock it a little bit more.

Even if you update the Windows 8.1 or the ATI video card Drivers, nothing will happen. The only solution I find was updating to Windows 10. Something else, the AMD Radeon Software I think they don't like Intel I5 cpu, maybe they want me to upgrade to AMD Rysen (marketing).

Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,All the bang for a little buck!,"Upgrading from an ancient 2012 model GTX 650. For those that don't know, these are ancient and I'm pretty sure my iPhone has better graphics...
Old school AMD quad processor, 4.1ghz
8GB RAM
Win 7

^^ Not high end specs by ANY means. Very ancient in terms of gaming power.
I play everything on low, lower, lowest.

Bought this card, had to tell my BIOS to only talk to one PCI E slot (not sure why since it was the same one from the GTX 650) and install some drivers.

I mainly play WoW these days. Everything literally set to 1 (lowest, with most options disabled)
Rebooted, WoW was immediately on High with some options in particle rendering set to Very High. I fiddled with it and managed to get almost everything to Very High with disabling things I don't care for too much like sunshaft quality, shadow quality, etc., and am still running around idling with a 95-100 FPS. In 25man raids it drops to about 80. Mind you, this is with an ancient cpu and very low ram.

As far as the card itself is concerned, besides being a massive upgrade, it doesn't have any pin connectors or anything, you just slot it home and that's it. Its silent, has a fan/heatsync combo, and stays nice and cool after hours of raiding. It has the option for overclocking, but I just don't need it with WoW. And WoW is also known to be rather demanding when you crank the settings all the way up. I also play Dreadnaught at max settings across the board.

Amazing little card that can breath fresh life into a 6 y.o rig!"
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily one of the best sub-$100 GPU on the market!,"I purchased this to upgrade my older rig- while my ""main"" PC is in my office, my ""old"" PC is in my living room- so it does get quite a lot of use. I tend to play fairly easy-to-run games on the PC in question, but even still, the MSI R7 250 2GB DDR3 inside was struggling.

Fable Anniversary could barely pull down 30FPS on medium settings. Wolfenstein The New Order/The Old Blood would be at 25-30FPS on low/medium settings. Even Crusader Kings II, Hearts of Iron III/IV, and Stellaris ran at sub-60FPS on low/medium settings.

I purchased the GT 1030 to remedy these faults, and boy, was I not disappointed. 60+ FPS on Fable Anniversary on max settings. Steady 55-60FPS on Wolfenstein on max (okay, very close to max) settings. Paradox games went from a 20-25FPS to well over 70. I was quite shocked by the latter.

To wrap up my review of its performance- let's talk over clocking. Once (basic) drivers are installed via the included CD, a built in clock control program is also installed. It is easier to use than Afterburner, having safe presets- but does not allow for as much control until specifically placed in ""professional"" mode. Otherwise, the clock speeds are just fine for a 69 dollar card. On top of that, the VRAM is DDR5- a massive upgrade for those still running DDR3 VRAM.

As to the more physical nature of the card- wow, is it tiny. Less than half the size of my replaced R7 250, probably a quarter of the size of the 1070 in my main computer. Far lighter as well.

Installation was simple, as it only draws power directly from the PCI slot/motherboard. Speaking of power- this thing barely draws any. Can't recall exactly, but I know that it's a minuscule amount. As long as you have a 300-350W power supply, you'll be fine.

Be warned- given the size, this card only produces ONE DVI port and ONE HDMI port. That's it. Just something to think about. I was a bit surprised they didn't put a VGA slot on a card NVIDIA is touting as the answer to every budget gamer's needs- but I digress. I suppose even HDMI-sporting monitors/TVs are cheap nowadays.

Card is whisper silent, although the first time I installed it, it spun hard and fast for a few minutes, and made considerable noise- don't freak out if that happens. She has great thermals, but I do have an overkill cooling setup in this PC, so results there are probably skewed for the average person who isn't obsessed with cooling.

Anyways, a $69, low-profile, Pascal-based, NVIDIA GPU? It's not too good to be true. Give it a shot if you're on a budget, have power or size restrictions,or even if you're just an NVIDIA or GPU enthusiast. It won't replace your 1070, but it will definitely surprise you- especially given its small form factor and low power draw.

Just a quick side note before I stop rambling- don't ask me how but- I'm pretty positive NVIDIA will be releasing a GT 1040 soon, perhaps by the end of the year. For those that aren't in a rush- perhaps wait for that?"

Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little card; easily handles 4K display,"I have an older small form-factor PC (the exact model is Gateway SX2865-UR26). This computer is used 99% for basic office tasks, watching YouTube, and minimal gaming. The PC has on-board video which was fine for normal office tasks, but it maxed out at HD resolution (approximately 1920x1080). I eventually upgraded to a 4K monitor, but my computer's built-in video couldn't handle that resolution, so I needed to find a very small video card that was powerful enough to support a 4K monitor.

I tried an older card that I'd used with a 2.7K monitor, but it was terrible -- that card was constantly crashing and causing all sorts of problems....it literally wouldn't allow me to watch full-screen videos.

After looking around on Amazon, I found this Gigabyte card and decided to give it a try. So far, it's been basically perfect. First, it fit into my PC's very small case (the case is very narrow so a ""normal"" height video card won't fit). Second, after a simple install and setup, the card has been running perfectly -- zero crashes or other problems.

Although my PC is not really used for gaming, I've tried running some really old favorites (Counter-Strike, etc.) and everything seems to run great. That isn't surprising given how old the games I'm playing are, but still -- so far this card has been fast and smooth with everything I've thrown at it. Pretty impressive given the low price.

One other comment -- this card does have a fan, but it appears to be completely silent. My PC is very quiet anyway, but I can't hear the video card's fan running at all.

P.S. One additional thing -- getting 4K/60Hz resolution on my monitor did not require any special cables....I just used an old HDMI cable I had sitting around and this worked fine. This is yet another bonus point since some monitors require different/special cables to achieve the highest resolution & refresh rates, but that fortunately wasn't the case here."

I did plenty of research looking for something that would work for my particular rig: I picked up an old(er) HP Elite 8200 SFF with Intel i5-2400 3.1 Ghz processor, and 8 GB RAM for pretty cheap from the IT department at work, and it had a GT 310 installed which was barely able to run SWTOR on low settings (30-40 fps). I was worried about finding something that would fit the SFF tower and would run on the stock ~240W power supply (didn't have the budget to upgrade both). Even though this card recommends min. 300W power supply, I researched the specs and it draws the same amount of power as the GT 310, so I felt safe giving it a shot. Plus, I don't have much else running off the PSU so my total power needs are relatively low. Installation of the hardware was easier than expected (yes, it includes the low-profile bracket which was necessary for the SFF tower), and the software installation was as simple as booting up the computer after installing the graphics card and running the CD. It took about 20 minutes to install all the programs and drivers and was ready to go. I am now playing SWTOR on Ultra settings at 1600x1200 resolution with a framerate of 80-90 fps. I was able to temporarily plug into a different monitor and play on a slightly modified Very High settings (reduced AA, but not off) getting 60-70 fps at 1920x1080. I don't have a need to play the most recent games, just some sorta-oldies-but-definitely-goodies (I will be trying out Skyrim soon, and I have no doubts it will run fine on High settings). I have to say that this card is really great for the price and an outstanding choice for an entry-level graphics card for gamers on a budget."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is not a true gaming card and I am sure if I had tried to play something like Witcher 3 I would have had to scale things ...,"I waited a couple of weeks before writing this review to avoid the new buyer enthusiasm, but my enthusiasm really has not dwindled.

I have a Dell Inspiron 3656 which is a small form factor case with a proprietary 240 watts power supply. I wanted to upgrade from the on board GPU, but quickly discovered that there were few options. In fact it was either an older card from several years back or this one, the Geforce GT 1030. I went with the Gigabytes card because of the fan which makes it a thinner card more suitable for my small case.

This card has exceeded my expectations. Before installing the new card I ran 'winstat formal', a built in benchmark in Windows 7 thru 10. The on board GPU scored just 5.1 for graphics. After installing the Geforce GT 1030 I ran winstat again. This time the graphics score was 8.1 (on a scale of 1-9.9 in Windows 10). I am now able to play two year old games at 1080 with high graphics settings. This is not a true gaming card and I am sure if I had tried to play something like Witcher 3 I would have had to scale things down a bit. In Kerbal Space Program I am able to play a moderately modded game with thirty part ships at about 30-40 fps. At this point my CPU is the bottle neck.

Another point I want to stress, because I think it is important, is that the fan over my APU no longer kicks in. When I would first start my computer or launch a ship in Kerbal Space Program, the fan would roar up to full speed to keep the APU cool, but after installing the GT 1030, it does not. The APU is running much much cooler, which is a very good thing. I could probably overclock the system now, which Gigabytes makes very easy with its utility.

The fan on the Gigabyte GT 1030 is really very quiet, not much above ambient room noise. This make the card a perfect choice for a small form factor low wattage HTPC. You would never hear it above the sounds in the 4k movie you are watching. I can not hear it above the sound produced by my heater.

If you have a Dell or HP computer with a small form factor case and low wattage power supply, this is the perfect upgrade to eek out a couple more years out of your system. Or, if you want to reuse your older computer as a HTPC capable of watching 4k videos, this card will do it for you."

I was swapping out an older mobo from a mid atx tower to a slim case. I needed a low profile, low power consumption video card capable of DirectX12 to replace the GT630 on this old AMD triple core pc with only a 300W PSU running Win10 64bit. For $75 the GT1030 was a good value option considering GT 730 and 710 were selling for approx $65\60. Installation was easy and simple. I used online drivers, but the box does include a driver disc. This particular card does not feature a VGA port so please be aware. Also the card comes with both the full and half size brackets but mine did require swapping out the installed bracket since I installed this card into a slim case.

Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lets See How Noisy or Quiet This Card Is, and What Is Its Best Use?","Review for: GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 Single Slot Low Profile (skinny, short)

Greetings everyone,

In Part 1 we will show the result of noise testing, and in Part 2 we will note what this special unique card is best suited for.

PART #1: SUMMARY OF NOISE TESTING:
-----------------------------------------------

GOAL:

We want the fan to keep the Graphics Card GPU at or under 82-87C. This is 10-15C cooler than the max GPU temp (Tmax).

TEST ENVIRONMENT:

- SMALL COMPUTER CASE with lots of air venting (a worst case case for noise)
- NO OTHER FANS in the case other than CPU fan
- GPU at 100% load

RESULTS:

(1)
33%-50% fan speeds all result in 79C, nearly silent 2'+ away
55% fan speed result in 78C, and still quiet enough for under desk
65% fan speed result in 75C, Audible 4'+ away, OKish under desk
75% fan speed result in 70C, Audible 4'+ away, audible under desk
80% fan speed is MUCH noisier than even 75%

(2)
I CHOSE TO MOSTLY RUN AT 33% fan speed (lowest settable) since at 79C we are still well under the 82-87C goal. At that fan speed it is INAUDIBLE UNDER THE DESK.

33% Fan Speed translates to 1,940-2,090 RPM.

Side Note:
I would think in a mostly enclosed case it would be mostly silent on desk at 33% fan speed.

(4)
DON'T use AUTO to set fan speed as it prioritizes temperature over any concern for noise. AUTO can result in extremely high fan speed (ex: 85%) even when entirely unnecessary.

Instead use MANUAL or even better CUSTOMIZED.

CUSTOMIZED is set using the free GIGABYTE AORUS engine application (it's quite simple to use). I set customized as follows:
- 33% fan speed (lowest possible) until 82C
- 55% fan speed 83C-87C
- 95% fan speed 88C-100C

(5)
Remember that a video card pegged at GPU 100% load can generate different heat profiles depending on what it is doing, such as different games and workloads. It's not always the same heat profile even at a fixed GPU 100% load. Thus, 33% fan speed may or may not be adequate for your particular needs.

(6)
Based on all of this, if your new GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 card is quite noisy at low fan speeds like 55% fan speed then you may have a lemon and should exchange it. You will be doing GIGABYTE a favor, they have no desire that lemons make it to the customer.

SPECIAL FAN SPEED NOTES:

In case max fan speed or fan speed % calculations change, here are the RPMs found associated with different % fan speeds on this card.

% _____ RPM
----------------
33% ___ 1,940-2,090
35% ___
40% ___ 2,090
45% ___ 2,250
50% ___ 2,500
55% ___ 2,750
60% ___ 3,000
65% ___ 3,250
70% ___ 3,500
75% ___ 3,750

PART #2: WHAT'S THIS CARD BEST FOR?
-----------------------------------------------

What's special about this card is how remarkably skinny and short it is given its graphics power (SINGLE SLOT, LOW PROFILE). This allows a whole different level of graphics power for many small cases that couldn't otherwise fit anything near its graphics capability.

If you have a bit more space, such as double-slot or standard profile height, you might consider instead using FANLESS GT 1030 options, or for a bit more money up the graphics power a bit and go for at least the GeForce GT 1050 level cards or its AMD equivalents.

Keep in mind this card has 2 GB on it, which is plenty for many uses but can be quite limiting for some more demanding uses like video editing.

Hope that helps!

Best Regards,
Neil"

Especially from a company like nVidia. I had an HD 7750 that was the most powerful chipset (in the low profile, single slot part of the market) for my little brother’s “gaming” pc. Hardly any heat, and little no noise compared to the HD 7750! He plays a lot of light games, but had began playing XCOM 2 (not the most optimized for lower end chipsets) and the upgrade changed his resolution from 720p to 1080p with a higher frame rate! Great little card for anyone on a budget or with size restrictions."

The PC is an HP 510-p026. This PC had a 180watt power supply. I tried this card and it did not work do to the power-supply being to weak. Not to worry. I replaced this power supply with a 300 watt I had from another PC. Now the GT 1030 is running. I have been using this card for the past 4 months with no issues. I am running the card in a small case regular height. This card does come with a slim bracket for slim PC's. I like that card has a fan on it to keep it cooler while gaming. I use NZXT's CAM software to monitor temps while I play some games. GPU temp has never been higher the 60C under full load. It idles between 24 and 27C.
This card is not meant to play AAA titles at max settings. This is a budget friendly card meant to play e sports games and older games. If you want to get off you Intel integrated graphics this is the best card to start with for under $100.00.

This card is marginally better than the GT210 or 220series that came with SFF computers.
It takes up one slot in the computer, low fan noise, HDMI and DVI outputs. NO VGA outputs or dongles available.
As far as gaming, it can run lower end games on medium settings, or higher end games on low settings,
but this is also based on the processor you have as well.
This card will help free up resources for your machine if you're running on board memory, as well as being able to run dual monitors. You CAN do 4k, just not terribly well, again, depends on processor. i5 from skylake or better would be recommended. .
If you have room for two low profile slots, my recommendation is the 1050's. Or if you have full size slots, 1650."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Way better than expected.,"I got a free computer from work. It was an older dell optiplex (790) that are filling the shelves in our IT's storage room as the office gets upgraded. It's a small form factor case. It has a second generation i5 and 8GB ram. I didn't really have a use for it, but I thought it would be fun to see what a super-budget-friendly graphics card could do in a free computer. Honestly, I couldn't be more impressed. Since this is a current model, it has up-to-date drivers and supports the latest DirectX. so far, I've tested AC Syndicate, GTA V, Project Cars II, Dirt Rally and Fallout 4. All games perform flawlessly on recommended settings (low to medium). Though it does seem the recommended settings are a bit conservative for this card. I was able to turn them up a bit past the recommended settings with good results.

Besides performance, I was happy with how easy to install it was. The computer came with a 240W power supply, which is actually enough to power this card through the PCIe slot. Being low profile, it also fits perfectly in the small form factor case. I'm amazed at what I'm able to play on this $90 build (the only thing I bought was this graphics card)."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,3.0 out of 5 stars,It works for a while then hangs in 2 different workstations,"I got stuck with two HP z240 SFF Workstations from a bad business transaction, one with an Intel i3 and the other with an i5. Gave one to my grandson for video games. Bought the GIGABYTE GeForce GT 1030 which after some research seems to be a low budget good video card. I took some time before testing it. When my son tested it, he informed me that the video will hang randomly and even with the computer (Windows) up and working. The only way to fix it was by rebooting the workstation. After re-installing Windows 10 from scratch I gave it to my grandson. He complained about the same situation. I took it back and spent more than a week researching and testing many suggestions to fix the problem. Installed a new NVME PCIe 240GB SSD which was quite FAST (about 4 times faster than a SATA SSD). In my tests (I'm not a video gamer) seems to be good. But once give it back to my grandson the same behavior began again. After several days of tying and error, I decided to install it in my other workstation which has an Intel i5 PROC, 500GB NVME PCIe Intel SSD and a second SATA 240GB SSD. After a little while, the system started to hang again and as before it will send a message that it has no video. Reboot the workstation and started to work again until it will hang again. Spent several more days and even clean the SSD and reinstall Windows 10 from scratch again, but for no avail. That is when I decided to contact the manufacturer, GIGABYTE. They sent me an RMA confirmation and today I mailed it back (had to pay $12 shipping from my pocket). I will update this review once GIGABYTE answers me for a solution."

I had thrown this bad boy into a Dell Optiplex 1020 SFF which also had 16GB of Memory and an i5 processor. I had originally intended this to be a ""decent"" starter gaming machine for the kids, as they are young enough to not notice or care if their games didnt look super HD, plus the games they were playing were things such as Fortnite, Five Nights at Freddy's, Minecraft, Roblox, League of Legends, games that didnt require too much GPU power. Well I can say this...I decided that I would Install games like Need for Speed: The Run, Need for Speed: Rivals, and Sonic Generations. Not exactly super intensive games, but enough to try to test the card. Well, I will tell you that the card handled these games for the most part at the highest settings. NFS The Run ran flawlessly at the highest settings, NFS Rivals ran fine with a few hiccups here and there (when the environment got super detailed and several AI were on screen) and Sonic Generations ran flawlessly on the highest settings. Of course, it is now after Christmas and the kids have been playing fortnite, minecraft, league, and all sorts of other games without any issues. I definitely recommend this card for small builds and for any casual gamer."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hesitation while running in WOW Classic, try another brand.","Basically for WOW classic players.

Maybe I got a bad card, but while running in Hillsbrad foothills down the road I noticed every so often my toon would slow down like with a tiny hesitation. I lowered my settings to the lowest and it did the same. Tried a lot of different settings and areas...and always random slowing down while moving.

I thought maybe it was my 300 watt power supply so I installed it into my larger desktop with a 400w PS. Same thing...slight hesitation while running every few seconds. Went to Org and same thing...even with nobody around.

Installed a 750ti and had no issues on either PC. I reinstalled my older hd7750 and still no issues at all on either PC.

Like I said, maybe I got a bum card. I stuck it in my HTPC and using it at 720p resolution for popcorn time and seems to be working. 1080p stutters a bit.

Basically disappointed as it is super quiet and I really wanted to upgrade my hd7750 and get rid of its fan noise.
I do not suggest Gigabyte 1030 gt. Also include software will aorua what ever software that is included because will crash your PC during install. Don't try it.

Good luck!"
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Home theater PC set ups and H265 / HEVC video decoding,"Didn't buy for games, rather using it in a HTPC build. My AMD APU setup worked well for years with H264 based codecs but time has moved on and H265 is coming to the forefront as a newer and more efficient video codec. HEVC or H265 would drive my cpu usage to 99-100% on an AMD A10 as that generation lacked H265 support, after installing this video card, the cpu usage has dropped down dramatically to 7-8% CPU usage when playing H265 files and should extend the life of this build for another few years."

Fit well in my Dell Precision t3600 easily. Am able to watch 4k videos at 60 fps. Tip: If trying to watch 4k @ 60hz over HDMI make sure the TV is set to HDMI 2.0 or greater.

Obviously this isn't a top of the line card for gamers but you probably already know this. However if you rarely play heavy games and just want it for desktop use and watching movies then this is a good card."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was the onboard video!,"Bought this to see if my onboard video was dysfunctional.
Computer would boot, but nothing on the monitor.

MB: MSI z97 PC MATE
CPU: i7 4795k
RAM: 16GB
GPU: none before (installed this card to see)

I accidentally reconfirgured the windows of a stock chart program.
In order to not have the program save the new configuration, I turned off my computer at the PSU switch while Windows was still running.
After that, for whatever reason, the monitor would not show input when the computer was turned on.

Having troubleshoot some components (RAM, HD, cables, monitor), I searched the internet for similar causes.
Primary cause was not clear cut - some said PSU, some said MB, some said HD, etc.
I figured that since the power was on, HD was spinning, and blue LEDs were on in the case, it had to be the onboard video.

Not wanting to waste $40 on an underpowered older GPU, I opted for this GT 1030.
It's not for major gaming, but for my 4k television monitor and my TOS stock charts with real time data (18 small charts at once), it seemed to be what was needed as those two factors do require some processing power and memory.

I initially installed it on the lower (blue) PCI slot of the motherboard...nothing.
I moved this card to the upper (blue) PCI slot, and VOILA! I get Windows! (albeit initially at 1080p max due to Windows' VGA drivers).

The item came in it's GIGABYTE package undamaged.
New tape was on the tab.
New tape was on the electroprotective package.
It also had plastic covers on the terminals and 2 ports.
It was missing a manual and maybe a driver disc, but all I needed to do was download it off of GIGABYTE's website and install. Upon driver install completion, I was asked to reboot. On reboot, 4k resolution instantly appeared.

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.
I'm happy with the ""open box"" price as well.
Delivered in 2 days and I didn't have to spend the gas to drive over to Microcenter or Best Buy, both of whom had similar prices for new. But for this aging machine, a few bucks saved is a few bucks earned."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than integrated graphics, fair solution to pre-built PCs","First gigabyte video card I've used for a client's build and I'm impressed. The packaging from gigabyte isn't anything amazing but with low end cards I wouldn't expect them to be. Used this card for a client, for mainly home theatre use and light gaming. It runs quiet, comes with half height bracket, and to be honest when you are used to using bigger mainstream gaming video cards it's kind of adorable. This video card won't play the newest AAA games but, it will work better than integrated graphics and is really aimed at home theatre use. Somewhat comparable to the 750ti but with half the power consumption, I would recommend this in a pre-built system with a proprietary power supply like a dell 3650 or similar that doesn't require a power connection."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,4.0 out of 5 stars,tremendous speed improvement in video encoding,"Purchased this for one reason only: hardware encoding of videos. Pain in the southern most region to work out the ffmpeg commands to accomplish the task but once done there was a tremendous speed improvement. FYI:
=============
# create a 'HWtranscode' function
function HWtranscode () {
for f in *.ts;
# nividia hardware transcoding
do ffmpeg -hwaccel cuvid -i ""$f"" -vcodec h264_nvenc -profile:v 2 -g 30 -qp 26 -c:a ac3 ""${f%.ts}.mp4"";
done
}
=============

As for its use as display card: Is seems adequate to drive my two dell 24 inch monitors. I can not detect any other particular improvements. The tiny dongles it requires are a also a pain in the most southern region.

Update September 2018:
No problems and I occasionally use it to drive a 42 Inch Visio TV TV as well as the two Dell computer monitor.
I note someone commented about the quality of the video encoding. That is controlled by the encoding parameters. You can anything from low quality and high speed to high quality and low speed. I tried for something in the middle.

These are the cables that I am using. I needed a 10 foot and a six foot cable. These work and are relative thin. I tried some others that did NOT work."
PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,Nvidia,NA,4.0 out of 5 stars,Three outputs is deceiving,Good product but you cannot use all three video outputs simultaneously. The max is two at once.
PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,Nvidia,NA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Driver install in a Linux environment is unorthodox,"Installed this board for CAD under Ubuntu 18LTS. The UBUNTU drivers for the board don't work properly, so you have to use the Nvidia drivers. Nvidia's install script leaves a lot to be desired. It works, but isn't obvious. It also doesn't update the /etc/default/grub file so if you happen to change it, the driver disappears and you're left at 640x480. Reinstalling the driver solves the issue, but Nvidia should update the system files so that changing Grub doesn't clobber their driver."
PNY Quadro P400 Graphic Card,PNY QUADRO,Nvidia,NA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works with Ubuntu 20.04 and Nvida Driver 440.64,"I bought this (VCQP400-PB) card to replace an AMD V7900 that died. I'm using it in Dell T5500 workstation with 3 monitors, two in landscape and one in portrait mode. All three monitors are attached using DisplayPort cables. The card is small, so I had to use the included taller bracket to install. The card is short in length and in height.

The card is low power and doesn't require the use of an extra 6/8 pin power cable.

The card does support 3 monitors simultaneously. Also, the card came with three miniDP to DP adapters, even though they're not shown in the V1 pictures. As I write this only the pictures for the V2 version show the adapters. I would preferred not to have to use adapters, but I would have to buy a much more expensive card to get standard DisplayPort connectors. The mini connectors do lock into the back, so except for reliability problems associated with more connections, I expect these will work OK.

The only problem I had with installation was getting the portrait monitor to work. The Ubuntu display settings tool just wouldn't work with the portrait monitor. It either turned the monitor off or left it in landscape mode. I solved the problem by using the Nvidia X Server Settings tool.

I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak to performance there, but playback in Kdenlive (a non-linear video editor) was smoother than with the AMD card. HTML5 rendering in browsers also seems a bit faster.

Amazon was the vendor. No problems with the shipping or packaging."

Speed yes, quality no. The default installation also includes some audio drivers that played havoc with my Windows 10 64 bit system. Found a couple recommendations to remove them, which I did but continued to have some weird audio problems. Replaced with a GTX 1050 since the video encoding was a bust and my audio problems went away."

Gigabyte GeForce GT 710 2GB Graphic Cards and Support PCI Express 2.0 X8 Bus Interface. Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,1.0 out of 5 stars,works with legacy bios,"My 8 yr old pc is certainly overdue to be replaced but it does what I need it to do. My only issue was that the video card fan was dying so it was either build a new pc or replace the video card and squeeze out a bit more from this relic. Of course with the GPU market being overpriced due to data mining it took me a while to figure out how much performance I was willing to pay for at this time, with maybe an eye towards this being used in a new pc build over the next year. Fortunately the extra research this required allowed me to stumble upon an issue I didn’t know I had. That issue is that a few years ago PC BIOS was replaced by UEFI and the latest video cards won’t even boot on what is referred to as ‘legacy’ bios. After some research I found that this 1030 card is one of the most recent cards which will boot with legacy bios and is why I selected it. It was also only around 70 bucks which made this an easy choice. It installed easily, I pulled down drivers from Nvidia, and all is well. This card was theoretically 50% faster than the card it was replacing but when I ran new benchmarks it only reflected a few percentage points in some tests and better in others. There are other bottlenecks on this old system so I’m not surprised but since I can’t install anything newer than this model, and my old card was dying, I’m still happy with this purchase."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 710 2GB Graphic Cards and Support PCI Express 2.0 X8 Bus Interface. Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great card for casual to medium gaming,"Great graphics card for casual to medium gaming. Runs Rocket League, CSGO, the 2011 version of Skyrim, and Fallout:NV at high/ultra settings in 1920x1080 at well over 60 fps. Also runs Fortnite at medium-high settings in 1920x1080 at around 50-60fps. Can run pretty much any non AAA title, as well as most AAA titles released before 2015/16 at decent settings (depending on your CPU and RAM, of course). It is very easy to install, just pop it into your PCI-e 16 slot on your motherboard, as it only requires 30W of power. It can fit into most medium to large sized cases (the actual dimensions of the card are 4.38in x 6.6in x 1.1in for WxLxH, not what it says on the Amazon page). It is also very quiet, even when it is running games. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade your system without spending over $100 and still getting solid performance for its price point, I highly recommend it."

Gigabyte GeForce GT 710 2GB Graphic Cards and Support PCI Express 2.0 X8 Bus Interface. Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, So good! (non-gaming)","I received my GT 1030 OC from Amazon Warehouse Deals (AWD) today and promptly installed it in my 11 year old HP Pavilion Elite M9200t [Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q9450 @ 2.66 GHz 2.67 Ghz, 8GB RAM, Win10 64 bit, PCIe 2.0}...piece of cake, and backward compatible with PCIe 2.0.

As other reviewers suggested, I didn't bother with the enclosed CD-I went to the Gigabyte website to install the latest drivers & the Aorus Engine, mainly to monitor the temperature due to past video card overheating experience (no gaming).

I'm replacing a seven year old EVGA GT 520 card that's been recently having a problem with the fan- it stops turning at inappropriate times and overheats (I used canned air & a vacuum a few times in the last two months to get out any dust particles that might be unseen, which helps for awhile ).

Last week, I tried an open-box Gigabyte GT 1030 silent low-profile (from AWD), but within minutes, it seemed to be running quite hot, despite multiple fans in my PC, so much so that it did sudden re-boots of my PC several times. It also had such a tall heatsink that it was smashing the firewire plug on my motherboard. Not sure if that had anything to do with the hot temp & multiple re-boots. I had to send it back. My power supply is a 385W that isn't maxed out so it's not that.

This GT 1030 SC isn't as tall as the fan-less GT 1030, so it's well below the firewire plug and has been running fine without any re-booting issues. The temp has stayed around 37°(C) with standard PC use (no gaming, just watching videos, web surfing, MS Office, etc).

So far, this card seems like the perfect replacement for an old PC like mine or newer machine.

NOT reflected in my review rating is that I went with AWD to save a few dollars over a new item. I'm not opposed to an open-box product if it works as it should. I'll admit, I was initially concerned about the condition of the card when I saw the box's condition, but the card seems to function fine. AWD's description of the item was accurate. Everything is running great! :o)

UPDATE April 25, 2019: Three months later, this card is still working great on my 11 year old HP Pavilion Elite M9200t (no ""gaming"", just Microsoft Office 2016, graphics/photo editing, some video editing, Internet, machine embroidery digitizing & designing, etc.)"

Most highend games will play well at medium settings. But since I’m not a consistent gamer it’s not a problem. Recommend a cpu of intel i5 or higher. Or a Ryzen 3 thru 5. Ryzen 7 will bottleneck it’s performance with this card though. (GPU)"

Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,High Frustration Factor!!!,I bought this to replace a GeForce GTX 750 TI 2gb which I'm migrating to my backup system. Installed and got beautiful color crisp and sharp images with Windows 10 drivers. Installed drivers from disc and image was washed out and blurry. I uninstalled all drivers and got great image with Windows 10 drivers again. Downloaded latest drivers from device website and installed them. Image became washed out and blurry. Spent many unsuccessful hours researching a fix and trying every tweak I could find. Good with Windows drivers. Washed out and blurry with device drivers. So frustrating to have to work so hard to find a way to make a brand new device work properly. Manufacturer should be aware of this problem because of the number of people reporting the same experience online over several years span. Shame on you Nvidia.

Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't understand stats, I'm just a user who wants my desktop to function as a mid range PC should","I bought this GPU after doing hours of research. I had less than $100 to put into a PC that I had invested $127 into in hopes of reaching an FPS average that would allow me to play online racing and flying simulators without the latency that would hinder my ability to be competitive or cause grief to those playing on the same server due to my inconsistency in the game's sync. I bought an older Dell Optiplex 790 retired workstation PC from the FB marketplace for $100 that came with an Intel I7 CPU, 8GB RAM, DVD-RW, front multi card reader, 1GB GPU, and 300w PwrSply, but no wi-fi card, input devices, display or cords. I had a small junk pile of old keyboards, mice, cables, etc due to being very low income because of decisions made 25yrs earlier. Anyways, I get a lot of use from repairing broken things as well as giving new life to older items in which people have lost interest or have upgraded from. I found this and pulled the trigger with the order. While waiting on its arrival I installed 4GB of RAM for $23 to give me 12GB RAM. I also downloaded iRacing, War Thunder, Project Cars 2, and a lower level MS store flight sim in anticipation. With the original 1GB GPU, iRacing would run at 70FPS at the lowest settings which isn't suitable for dirt racing as dynamic HDR graphics are required to compete at any level. War Thunder wouldn't run at all on minimum settings without consistent tearing and lockups. Project Cars 2 would run barely on min while the low min req need flight sim would run but was full of lag with settings higher than midrange. After I installed and properly set up the drivers and config of the GeForce GT 1030 2GB I decided I had no idea what I was doing when reading stats. This GPU runs all the above games on at least medium settings without any lag or graphic degradation during play. I can run iRacing on their recommended cap of 84FPS with most graphical ""extras"" and aids on high while running car and track textures on ultra-high. I also use med resolution shadows, reflections, dynamic tire and track, and pit crews. I am amazed that I have a PC that I have less than $250USD invested yet it performs as well, if not better than most $500-$1100 ""gaming PCs"" sold in department stores. I have used this PC with GeForce 1030 2GB GPU for a while now without unwanted issues. I am so pleased I have built a custom sim racing cockpit, FFB competition-level racing wheel and pedals, flight stick(HOTAS), soundbar w subwoofer, BlueTooth and WiFi dongles, and a wireless mouse. I now have a decent gaming setup that I use for sim car, truck, FPV drone racing/flying as well as shooter games, streaming, mild video editing, web surfing, watching movies and bragging to those that spent 5X more for the same level of usefulness. my recommendations? Buy the damn card if you have a decent CPU, power supply, and amount of RAM if you want a mid-level gaming machine that doesn't cost more than it realistically should. You get what you pay for and a lot of times we often pay a lot of money to get ripped off on good products."

Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for heavy gaming but fine for light gaming, rendering, etc.","I am at a time in my life when I have more work than time most days and that doesn't leave a lot of time for gaming. That being said, I do use 3D applications like Blender in my work and occasionally I will sit down for a short gaming session. The computer I have came with Integrated Intel UHD Graphics which is not bad for basic tasks but would fall short on things like rendering graphics, modern games, etc.

I picked up this card because it seemed like a reasonable trade-off between price point and performance. My Blender projects render well with this card, but I am doing small scene renders not making a movie or anything like that. I have played a couple of games, Arma, 7 Days to Die, etc and the games played smoothly with no noticeable lag.

The card was easy to install and neither Windows 10 or Linux (Mint and Manjaro) have had any issues recognizing the card and installing the correct driver. The card is running at a comfortable 35° C right now even though I have a bunch of programs running as well as my browser."

Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good card for older games,"Needed a replacement video card, and opted for this one. Play mostly EveryQuest II and Guild Wars 2. And this card does amazingly well for those, although have to lower some settings.

Lately though, after about 3 months, have had desktop glitches with Firefox and some videos. Had a few black screens the eventually came back to life, have backed-out boxes in menus or forums, and small glitchy areas from time to time. Not had these issues when gaming. Guessing it is a heat related issue and I needed to ramp up the fan speed from my Nvidia motherboard.

Gaming wise though, anything past 4 hours and the card needs a break, Things tend to not be as vibrant. So take a break and turn the game off for a while, then go back at it when the card cools down more."

Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,POS,"I was running a Nvidia GeForce that was crisp and clean with a very nice picture, but in order to play a few new games I bought I had to replace it with an updated graphics card to get the Direct X 11 or higher This one sounded like it had a lot of Bang for the buck but it was a big disappointment . I ran the set up on the CD and it took forever to down load the drivers,, once that was done it took forever to install the drivers . Lastly, none of the drivers worked! I can’t even open the AORYS ENGINE to adjust my desk top settings. Right now it looks like the color is in 8bit mode that looks terrible being all washed out and to true color. Too bad I waited a month to open the box , now I am stuck with this pos , I would have been better off driving down the road throwing my money out the window.

Update: before I pulled the card back out and started over - I decided to download the drivers straight from NVIDIA web site and ran the EXE - only then I was able to open the display settings Though their software and after sever attempts I was able to adjust my display setting to a tolerable view. Hence , stay away from the CD drivers. It was a mess....... and It may have even added Malware to my computer system that I am unaware of.."

Graphic Cards Gv-N710D5-2Gil,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$49.99,1.0 out of 5 stars,Provides 4k Resolution; Poor Video Performance,"This card is excellent if you simply want to bring 4k resolution and HDR to Windows 10. I dont play PC games so I wasn't workied about getting a top of the line graphics card... I wish I would have spent a little more money to get a slightly better card tho.

Watching and streaming video in any resolution goes from being super smooth to choppy for a few seconds and then back again. This is especially apparent when watching 4k and HDR content. Many times playback will speed up to ""catch up"" after it's choppy phase.

This card is a great choice of you simply want to bring 4k resolution to an older PC. However, it can't back up its claim to provide ""smooth 4k video playback"". If you're look for video performance - spend a little more on a better card."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fantastic choice for the average PC gamer on a budget.,"I do a good amount of PC gaming, but I don't play the latest AAA games on it. Instead I mostly play older titles and indie stuff that isn't super demanding. I recently got a refurbished PC for cheap and the onboard graphics card was so bad that it couldn't run games that the five-year-old budget computer it was replacing COULD run. Forced to upgrade it, I decided on this card, as at the time it appeared to be the best ratio of price to quality. The ultra-powerful cards were out of my budget, and the ones cheaper than this seemed like they wouldn't be enough of an upgrade to bother.

Getting the thing installed took a while, but I did eventually manage it on my own, and it was my first time ever installing a graphics card. I also got myself an upgraded power supply while I was at it and installed that, too, just to be sure my PC could handle the new card. Once it was installed, getting all the drivers and such on board took even longer, but eventually I was good to go. The result was everything I could have hoped for - my PC now plays every game I throw at it without issue, and it even runs more quietly than before.

As long as you aren't demanding the biggest, newest games on the highest settings, this card should be perfectly suitable for your needs if you're finding yourself with too many games in your collection that refuse to boot due to an inadequate graphics card."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for my HTPC,"I'm re-purposing my older i7 workstation to a combination HTPC and NAS. I don't game and I don't need a big, powerful and expensive graphics card. I was mainly looking for a decent card with 4K and multichannel audio pass through.

My research led me to this card. It arrived yesterday and I installed it as soon as I got home. Installation was straightforward. The latest drivers downloaded and I was up and running in no time.

I have it feeding into my Onkyo AVR, which outputs to my Mitsubishi projector. The image quality is limited by the 1080p projector, but looks fine. The audio pass-through is great. I pulled my sound card and use the video card to send my audio to the AVR.

Study your needs, but it suits me fine. It is well built and easy to get up and running."
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank baby jesus!!!,"This GPU is for VERY specific situations. The individuals rating this one star quite possible did not know what in the world they were buying, were being cheap and simply bought the most affordable ""GPU"" or who knows what.. Let me just say that their reviews should be taken with a grain of salt.

The day this was announced I was ecstatic, this was the exact GPU I was in search of for quite a while. 4 HDMI outputs, Zero display ports, Zero Type-C ports, Zero VGA ports. JUST HDMI. Thats what I needed, ASUS delivered.

Let me give you a run down on my set up.. I have an Micro-ATX asrock x570 TB3, Ryzen 9 3950X, 32GB RAM and an RTX 20080. If you're knowledgeable on the Motherboard you'd know it only has one PCIE port. which is utilized by the 2080 GPU. I have this 710 connected via Thunderbolt 3. WHAAAT?! I have four 4K TV's connected to the 710 through TB3, downscaled to 1080P and 30 hertz. It runs like butter. The TV's are used for security camera feeds of 4 different sites running on Blue Iris. I offload all the video conversion/transcoding onto the 2080 as intended and utilize the 710 for its sole purpose, displaying static video. Thats exactly what this GPU is for, not for gaming, not for office work, rather for static imagery such as billboards, a wall of TV's, surveillance, etc. Dont expect this GPU to do any transcoding or high refresh rate situations.

The second unit I have is being used as interim as I await the delivery of another graphics card, GTX 1080. It powers, with no issue, an LG 3440 x 1440 34"" ultra wide monitor with 21:9 ratio. Again, zero issues with the operation. I dont game on the PC yet until I get the true GPU in.

You cant compare apples to apples here, this GPU has 192 CUDA cores, in comparison my 1080 has well over 1900 CUDA cores. Know what you are buying, Know what you will be using this GPU for. For me, this device works as I initially intended and for that, THANK YOU ASUS! you really saved me from using two GPU's for four HDMI connections. The fact that I can use an external Thunder Bolt 3 enclosure to power and send data for the GPU is just amazing.. No regrets, highly recommend this GPU"
Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great multi-monitor video card!,"I am running three full screen movies simultaneously on three 24-inch 1920x1080 FHD computer monitors connected to this card, and all three movies look fabulous. There are no buffering pauses, no jerkiness and the action is as smooth as any movie I have ever seen on any single-monitor computer. Folks, this is an amazing video card at a great price. For those who gave it one star, all I can say is they probably didn't realize that they needed to install the 64-bit drivers from the DVD that is included with the card. Without those drivers, Windows will default to a generic VGA driver, resulting in exactly the kind of slow, jerky video that the one-star reviewers complained about. Not only is this card displaying three full motion, full screen, full HD videos simultaneously, but the GPU isn't even breaking a sweat! The GPU Tweak utility that comes with the card shows that it is loafing along at well under the clock and temperature maximums, with plenty of capacity remaining for a 4th monitor if and when I decide to add one. By the way, I bought this card to use with my multi-monitor trading setup, and it is more than up to the job. Price charts and indicators on all three monitors are crisp and clear, updating instantaneously as new data comes in. If you are a trader looking to create a multi-monitor setup on a budget, look no further.

I am using this video card in a 5 year old Windows 7 Professional 64-bit desktop computer with an Intel i7-4790 3.6GHz processor, 12GB RAM and 1TB HDD."

I guess it works ok if you have non moving things on your screen like spread sheets or text documents. But even the most basic of videos (even if I unplug all but one screen) and the video becomes choppy and un-watchable. Very displeased with the card.

Gigabyte GeForce GT 1030 GV-N1030D5-2GL Low Profile 2G Computer Graphics Card,Gigabyte,Nvidia,$84.99,1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE. NOT FOR WATCHING VIDEOS AT ALL. JUST OK FOR BASIC WORK,"As in other comments, I purchased this card expecting to have a third monitor with HDMI, to play time to time videos in Youtube, as well as to open browsers and excel sheets for my work. Well, for work is just ok. For Videos is terrible. Specially if you attempt to watch them at 1080 resolution. Video stops every 5 seconds, and skip parts. Issue is not only with Youtube, but any video streaming via Chrome, Edge, or apps.
Not sure if it's because the PCIe X1 version (the smallest, less fast, slot of the PCIe family), but I didn't have any other option rather than buying a Card for x1, since my PC only has 1 PCIe x16 slot, and that one is being used with the original Video card RX 550, which works great with my other 4k monitors.

I have a RTX 3080 in one slot, and this in another slot - the idea was I could add the various chat windows I use for work.

When I move the mouse into the screen that is being driven by this card the mouse pointer gets all jerky and slow - its nearly un-usable. If I'm playing a video on the 710 driven screen - its smooth and perfectly fine, UNTIL I move the mouse into that screen.

This machine is no slouch either - 32 gigs of ram, 9900K CPU, etc etc.
