      "[\"I need a graphic card upgrade for a very old compact desktop PC, Acer Aspire A3910 from 2010. This  MSI GeForce GT 710  is an entry-level graphic card that fits my requirements perfectly. Here are several reasons why I picked this card instead of something more powerful:\\n- It is relatively inexpensive.\\n- It is low profile and occupies only one PCI slot. This is important since my PC has a SFF (small form factor) case with limited space.\\n- It consumes very little power (20W max), so even the 220W power supply in my PC can handle it.\\n- It uses only heatsink for passive cooling. This eliminates the noise and reliability problems associated with cooling fans.\\n\\n[Installation Confusion]\\n- Initially right after the graphic card was installed, I can only get a display of 1200x800 from the HDMI port. Nothing from VGA port.\\n- After I installed the MSI VGA Drivers from disc, my monitor can now display 1920x1080 from VGA port, but nothing from HDMI port.\\n\\nThe problem could be from my computer's motherboard, since I observed the same behavior with the  EVGA GeForce 210  I previously purchased (and returned). Just keep this behavior in mind, in case you cannot see any display right after installing the card.\\n\\n[Graphic Performance]\\nI ran the 3DMARK 'Cloud Gate' benchmark on my PC, both before and after the graphic card upgrade:\\n- With integrated graphic, the overall score is a pathetic 209.\\n- After installing the GT 710, the score jumps up to 3735!\\n(see my uploaded screenshots for details)\\n\\nOn the other hand, the GT 710 cannot hold a candle against my better graphic card, the  EVGA GeForce GTX 750 Ti . When both cards were tested in a newer desktop PC ( Asus M32CD ), the 750 gives about 4x higher score . Note that the 750 does not fit in my old SFF PC since it is much larger. See my photo uploaded for size comparison between 710 and 750.\\n\\n[Power Consumption]\\nI used the  EUM-A1 Power Usage Meter  to measure the input power of my computer:\\n- Before the graphic card upgrade, my computer consumes ~50-55W when idle, ~70-75W when running 3DMARK.\\n- After the upgrade to GT 710, my PC consumes the same 50-55W when idle. This means this graphic card has the same standby power as the integrated graphic chip set.\\n- When running 3DMARK or  XCOM: Enemy Unknown , my PC now consumes up to 85-90W. That means the graphic card consumes 15-20W when it is running at full speed.\\n\\nAfter I played XCOM for several hours, the heatsink becomes too hot to touch, but not hot enough to cause a shutdown. In contrast, the EVGA GeForce 210 suffers thermal shudown after just ~10-20 minutes of playing XCOM. This is because the 210 consumes more power (30W vs. 20W) but comes with a smaller heatsink.\\n\\n[Conclusion]\\nThe GT 710 works very well in my particular situation. Of cause this is an inexpensive entry-level card, so I cannot expect the same level of performance as my GeForce GTX 750 Ti. But for a very small investment, I'm suddenly able to play many games which were previously unplayable on my old SFF PC. For that I'm happy.\", \"I generally don't write reviews, but since I did a fair amount of research before purchasing this for an older computer, I'm hoping that this information will assist potential buyers. I was looking for a way to boost the performance of an old Gateway SX2801-01e, thin profile desktop. It was maxed out on RAM (8 GB), but for whatever reason, just couldn't seem to generate graphics smoothly and without struggling. Not gaming, mind you, but for place-shifting and streaming video, and having multiple applications open. This card fit in the sole expansion slot for a PCI x16 card. My main concern was that the dated BIOS would be too ancient, or that the card would simply freeze up the computer. Neither happened. It booted into low-resolution at first while the drivers updated automatically. But after the updates and a couple of reboots, I was back in business. This old desktop has new life, as it runs like a new computer. (I had already migrated to a Samsung SSD and added a USB 3.0 card.) The built-in 2GB or RAM is supremely helpful. I'm also running with a 220W power supply, and not the recommended 300W without issues. It consumes a mere 19W. I'm going to upgrade my older monitor with a higher-resolution one now that the graphics card can support it.\", \"Fit like a dream, worked easily, installation was a cinch on every level.\\n\\nInstructions are not included for installing the low profile bracket. What you do:\\nUse a pair of needle nose pliers and unscrew the long bracket by twisting the little bolts that you woudl normally screw the video cable into. Just pinch the sides of each bolt and give little short twists (lefty loosey) until it comes loose, keep track of your bolts, and then once all four are out, you can easily separate the VGA socket (at the top in the main picture). The included short profile brackets are pretty obvious for placement, just watch the orientation. You'll end up using two of your external slots, but only the one PCI slot on the motherboard. The little bolts screw back in to the new brackets, and it's just fast and simple. I don't even think I ended up using a screwdriver at all, but the case we have was pretty much made for fast, painless installation without tools. The pliers are a must, though.\\n\\nWhile this does say it requires a 300w power supply, it's running absolutely fine on a 240w power supply. Didn't even have to plug it in to a separate power cable (which is good, because there wasn't one.) We're using it for older Steam games (Spore, for example) for my kid, on a Windows 7 machine we bought for $250, and this upgrade brings the machine pretty painlessly up to a decent standard for a lot of games. Just don't try to max your graphics out, because you don't want to overheat a fanless card.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm pleased. Oh, and everything comes packaged with little red caps over the connectors, which makes handling it a lot less nerve wracking while you're figuring the brackets out. A card I can hold easily while dicking around with the bracket? Thank you! They recommend using rubber gloves to avoid nicks, and I didn't, but this still may be the first time I've installed a video card when I didn't end up bleeding.\", \"I use the 710 video card in my PC Windows 10 for HDMI connection to my TV/Monitor. I need the sound for YouTube and other sounds on the PC. Video still works fine. Changed HDMI cables and tried switching ports on the TV/monitor. Still no sound. Support says get an RMA number on website and send it in for repair. That is not what I need. I need a replacement video card as I need the video card for my PC. I'll buy a different brand and send this one back to Amazon if that is their support.\\nUpdate 11/26/18: Are these cards not any good? Should I return this one for credit and purchase a better card. After purchasing this card, the HDMI slot lost the sound. I contacted the vendor and they wanted it returned for repair. It was only a week or so old. Instead of sending it in, I paid another $9 or so for a DVI to HDMI adapter cable and used the DVI slot on the card. I received sound and pictures for about 3 months and ow the sound has gone out on the DVI slot on the card. I did not want to return it as then my PC is out of video and sound until they take their sweet time to repair a $30 card rather than ship me a new one. This has broken twice so I recommend not to purchase this card for anything as it is junk and the customer support lacks a lot of support.\", \"I bought this for my son's PC as he wanted to play Fortnite on his PC at times.\\n\\nThere was originally only 4GB of RAM on the machine and integrated graphics. It would not even play Fortnite. After adding the graphics card it would play but did lag or would even crash some times. I then upgraded the RAM with an additional 8GB (4GB x 2 sticks) for a total of 12GB. Now he says it plays pretty smooth with no lagging or crashing. He does have the resolution turned down to the lowest setting. It's a $45 card and that's what I would expect, but I don't think he tried to turn it up since adding the RAM. He wasn't looking to build a gaming rig and just needed a better graphics card over what was integrated.\\n\\nHis specs:\\nDell Vostro 460\\ni5 processor\\n12GB RAM\\n320GB 7200 RPM HD\\n\\nI also bought the 4 year warranty on it for $1.54, so he can nuke it and I don't care. :)\", \"MSI is one of my go-to graphics card companies. Their quality is great, their cards perform well and their Afterburner software is second to none.\\n\\nLet's be up front about one thing here: a GT 710 is a GT 710. If you're looking for a gaming card, even just to play Windows Store games, look to at least a 730 or, better, a 750 Ti for entry level gaming.\\n\\nWith that behind us, let's talk about reasonable expectations for a 710. The purpose of a 710 is to give an old computer with no digital video output an HDMI jack. It's to beef up a PC with vintage 2006 integrated graphics and allow it to work with modern displays. It's my expectation that if a graphics card supports a given resolution, be that 1080p, 1440p or even 4k, that it will be capable of smooth video playback at that resolution. I chose this 710 for my HTPC because it supports 4k resolution, and I just needed my ancient PC to push 4k video. That's it.\\n\\nAnd here's where this card failed me. 4k video playback was subpar. It was choppy, the HDMI audio cut in and out, and it wasn't just one source. YouTube, local content, it all looked bad. 1080p was much better, but the 4K display did it no favors.\\n\\nThe 710's saving grace was that it was able to push convincing 1080p video to a 1080p monitor, and maybe that's really all it's useful for. If that's your use case, and for plenty of people I'm sure it is, this is a decent, cheap card for you.\\n\\nMine was returned. I didn't even bother goofing around with overclocking or temperature testing because I just didn't see a need to. The 710 clearly wasn't quite enough for my needs.\", 'This was a forced purchase under extreme budget limitations. It replaced old ATI HD 4600 series graphics cards which developed issues with dual monitor with the original Windows 10 creators Update and new blue screen issues with the Fall Creators Update. While ATI stopped supporting their product in 2015, Nvidia still releases a solid set of drivers that support the latest version of Windows 10. This MSI version of the GT 710 is very flexible. It supports both low profile (2 slots with brackets included), and standard profile (only 1 slot needed), and is cable of driving 2 HD monitors with ease. Compared to the HD 4650 it was replaced with, the 2d images and text see clearer and the colors more vibrant, even on 15 year old monitors running analog. Even though this is not a gaming card, it holds its own for the light to casual gamer and does not need a lot of power from the PSU to do so.', \"Inexpensive for a brand new video card. Solid DXVA capabilities for an HTPC. Worked great to replace a dying 7600GS in my dad's computer. Very low power.\\n\\nPassive cooling might not be enough for this card if you task it alot and have a case with very low airflow. My dad's small form factor PC saw it running in the 80s celsius just running some light games. I attached a slim low-noise 40mm fan to it with a ziptie and that was easily enough to cool it down. Now it never gets above 60*C when playing games for hours. So be aware the cooler is just too small to be a good passive cooler for games and DXVA in a super tight case. In a case with better airflow this is probably less of an issue.\\n\\nIt's paired with a C2D E7500 Wolfdale 2.93Ghz and 8GB DDR-2 800 RAM so not an amazing PC but enough to push this card along well enough. It runs Youtube, Netflix and Media Player Classic with 1080p mkvs smoothly. It has HDMI output which makes it good for our occasional HTPC needs. Again the card does DXVA okay, but not amazingly. Combined with the CPU it's more than enough to handle high bitrate 1080p which is the goal. So for that it's pretty useful despite the low performance. Better at DXVA than the 7600GS by a longshot.\\n\\nModern features but very weak performance. Runs older games somewhat worse than the ancient 7600GS it replaced, and newer games just a little better. This card isn't intended for games, but it would be nice to see it perform more like its specs. It's not as disastrous as the GT210 was, with simply broken performance, but it's pretty weak.\\n\\nThat said, it runs Source games okay with the settings scaled back, and runs Battlefield 1942, Call of Duty/UO and lots of other popular older games. My dad uses it to play Rome Total War and Medieval 2 nearly cranked which makes him happy. Runs most lighter-weight newer games with low settings as well. So it's not totally helpless, but it's not meant to compete as a gaming card. AMD's APUs are much faster than this, and the integrated in newer Intel CPUs is also much faster. For my dad's older PC though, this MSI GT710 was a perfectly reasonable replacement part.\", \"This is an older card of course so I can't recommend it for newer gaming. But It can keep up with maybe 80% of my steam library, which has lots of games pre-2016. Just don't expect to do some seriously high-end gaming and you're probably fine. Always check the game's specs and if a card is still in support when looking for what you need.\\n\\nIt was A BUTT to get the screws out to install it into the case because they were in so tight, but everything else about the install went smoothly. We have an HD monitor, and everything looks great. Supports the sound to said monitor as well. NVIDIA drivers are fantastic because they let you know when there's an update unobtrusively and they're very simple to install. Just a few clicks and 1-2 screen flashes and you're done. Supports dual monitors.\\n\\nThis went into a half-tower with an offensively small power supply (300w) so I had to unplug the blu-ray drive but it is working fantastically. For the price, I really have no complaints. It's been working great, and since the card is still in support, you'll continue to get drivers so your games don't crash suddenly. Or cook itself to death, like the card it replaced.\", 'Ok. Short story. RMA\\'d the card. Was quickly repaired and sent back to me via Fedex (less then 2 weeks). However MSI didn\\'t bother to ask me if it needed any special instructions return shipping, so it didn\\'t bother to tell Fedex to make sure I signed for it. Fedex said they delivered it (to my door) so I am 100% certain it was stolen (for my neighborhood, thats a big fat DUH). MSI says its not their fault, and that if I had wanted it signed for I should have called and said so. One guy told me that they don\\'t automatically tell Fedex to make sure its signed for because it costs them more to ship it that way.\\n\\nIn short. too bad, your screwed, we didn\\'t follow up on getting proper shipping instructions or even bother to ASK YOU if we should. Its your fault it got stolen, deal with it. Tried to call Corporate HQ multiple times, the secretary is NEVER there, messages go unanswered. 2 months now without a card. Its only a less than $50 card, I know I shouldn\\'t complain, but when you live on SSI/SSDI $50 isn\\'t something i can just \"lose\".']\n"
