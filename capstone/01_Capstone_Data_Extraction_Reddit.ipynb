      "[Techspot had an interesting theory](https://www.techspot.com/review/2099-geforce-rtx-3080/) about the bottlenecking at lower resolutions may not be entirely CPU based, if you were worried about your CPU not being brand new:\n",
      "\n",
      "> We've looked deeper at the RTX 3080's performance at 1440p, so we want to comment on that. As far as we can tell, CPU bottlenecking alone is not the explanation. The reason comes down to Ampere's architecture and the change to the SM configuration that we mentioned in the introduction. The 2x FP32 design can only be fully utilized at 4K and beyond. This is because at 4K the portion of the render time per frame is heavier on FP32 shaders. At lower resolutions like 1440p, the vertice and triangle load is identical to what we see at 4K, but at the higher resolution pixel shaders and compute effect shaders are more intensive and take longer and therefore can fill the SMs FP32 ALUs better.\n",

      "I was considering holding out for a 3090, but after the reviews I think I may just go for a 3080. Not hype related, but because it looks like the 3080 can do everything I need now.

Those that don't need a new GPU immediately (as in, didn't already sell hardware) the smartest path would be to upgrade CPU/mobo soon and wait a few weeks for the higher-end custom AIBs with raised power limits or wait until the 3080 Ti.\n",

I would only consider it if there were an over whelming number of DX12 and Ray tracing games available but there just aren't yet so more than likely skipping this gen. I play on a 1440p 240hz monitor, the 3080 might make sense for someone gaming at 4k who loves eye candy so they can guarantee a solid 4k60hz experience. I am interested in seeing what AMD releases as well. Good time to get into PC gaming for sure.\n",

The 3080 is a great purchase for anyone really, but to be reasonable it isn't something I need, yet.\n",
