    "Other than `amd`, `nvidia` and `card`, it seems that the most commonly occuring words are `performance`, `price`, Nvidia's GPU models the Rtx [`3080`](https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080/), Rtx [`3070`](https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3070/) and AMD's [`6800`](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-6800). These type of GPUs are catered towards enthusiast grade gamers who play in resolutions of 1440p and upwards and at frames above 60. The `dl` likely refers to Nvidia's DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) which uses the Tensor core AI processors on the GPU to boost frame rates and render beautiful and sharp images in games. Surprisingly, only one AMD model made it to the top frequent tokens list, which highlights the popularity behind Nvidia's cards. "

basically rx 580 die size mid upper tier card compete 2060s 2070s essentially rx 580 replacement card amd go much much bigger die size literally pack 3x amount shaders lot space go ray tracing higher clock power routing etc still ton room easily use 400mm big die pack double shaders rx 5700xt amd probably pay le nvidia 7nm wafer thats amd one tsmc top customer still samsung cheap amd probably need really think take nvidia time paying per viable die due samsung yield problem getting really good deal x200b samsung 8nm true half node behind tsmc 7 availability think tsmc worth front since capacity produce pretty sure nvidia paper launch amd overwhelm stock shell pretty much job done yet presentation said 8nm samsung 8nm inferior density tsmc 7nm yield still horrible according moore law dead

nvidia architecture hell lot efficient amd though 7nm 5700 xt competing 16nm gtx 1080 power efficiency previous gen 12 nm v 8 nm right still better product sad nvidias optimized 10nm still beat amd 7nm 5700xt also hotter comparable nvidia card last gen yikes yeah mean critical high density cpu afford go samsung inferior process save ton money still delivering pretty good performance also terrible yield x200b talking least half node behind tsmc 7p 7 30 yield nvidia good deal paying per viable die instead per wafer availability going zero q1 2021 marketing term actual transistor density also depends type transistor one manner similar even using samsung fable happened intel cannot happen basically also feeling price normal got used outrageous inflated price last 2 year crypto covid

obviously dl doubtful going beat 3080 3090 performance course 3090 price absolutely insane even power getting might room big navi flagship land somewhere chart lesser performance 3090 far reasonable

possible one remembers fiasco titan xp 1200 replaced month later performance 700 another titan xp lol still dumb done two week ago sell much broken maybe 3070 fast way le memory gpu price tend dip lowest right next gen announced go new card start shipping issue inventory amd plenty room set skus pricing think digital foundry already benchmarked 3080 performance found 60 80 performance increase 2080 without raytracing dl 4k http youtube com watch v cwd01yuqdva double performance 5700xt still significantly slower 3080 long price right ok suck amd compete high end looking chart 3080 double 2070s little 5700xt far 2070s yeah would need double good still enough sadly 3080 still faster long shot gonna bench patiently waitmarks probably caveat marketing need compete 3080 mean sure good midrange market bought old as 270 480 160 new suck thing cheap anymore even see feel higher framerate 3090 nervously spinning fan noise price many people would pay 50 000 gpu even gave 5 000 000x performance spent 400 1070 two generation ago think 500 better 2080 ti performance brainer especially sell old card amd easily match 3070 yes boat remember navi pricing amd right still 100 higher 9 10 series assuming inflation tarrifs etc nah nvidia raised price tier could plain simple turing gpus selling everywhere gamers nexus one video able confirm aibs selling turing problem yeah perhaps stock amd fire nonetheless simply supply demand may stock samsung dropped price fucking hell many people saying nvidia dropped price messing around wayback machine decided look newegg 2011 500 top line card 150 200 would something great really put current price perspective there another lineup fill price point next generation 16xx probably come along 3060 hmm say 300ish range sure ask maybe matching 2080 perf always use several site evaluate performance stated opinion 37 seems bit much think closer 25 30 range http youtube com watch v jkoul9hrgdg 968s min 16 agreed nvidia focused ai deep learning

alright though 3080 ti probably come close slotting 1000 going wait though gonna shoot 3080 oh remember prediction 30 series think launch slide performance may even exceed lol wait actual stuff

navi card rdna 2 time around expect 3070 performance minimum likely closer 3080 lacking feature tbf ryzen 3000 still pretty great would buying anything nvidia 3000 unless 50 current retail point rhetoric happens every launch amd never deliver poor volta lol want competition amd literally nothing rumour hollow dream hey parallel universe got one august 3 highly debating returning run 1080 75hz really dont think need 3070 level computing go back year 499 absolute top class gpu available cost improvement inflation thing expect nvidia click button 30 performance every 2 year keep selling gpus

though amd bulldozer moment gpus always competitive midrange high end define improve 10700k absolutely smoke 4790k replaced six year apart also latter 22nm tech 10700k 14nm hype amd price performance

le power cost time technically cheaper buy price nvidia capable profiting gpus low enough amd compete pricing cheaper enough make performance enough time marketshare already heavily dominant could push amd market agree saying anyone buy worse product loyal company saying concerned amd fell far behind yea amd need compete titan tier mid high would ideal long compete 3070 keep position bit want

alone price people xx60 series remaining xx70 one xx80 titan system amd match 3070 3060 come even 80 performance 3070 50 price 250 gain market share example rtx 3090 ti offer 300 performance increase 3090 99 people still buy 1500 budget people cannot afford drop money video game equipment stand nv cheapest card 500 lot room sub 500 range amd half ass pricing put 450 card 3070 performance crash

3070 actually 3060 named differently new 3090 card 3080 agreed amd need come swinging beat 3080 hope aggressive pricing sign navi 2 going great hope people actually buy amd bot please amd release something buy nvidia cheaper hope wont push way sweetspot know 3080 goal need beat put 3070 possible 3070ti super whatever decide come difference losing gracefully embarrassed see amd matching 3080 big navi maybe close gap maybe match 2080ti 3070 really well amd need compete 3090 gain mindshare folk still spend little product winning team even though buying halo product nvidia amd make far money lower end skus volume obsolescence greater 1080ti longevity likely annoyed nvidia extent lol performance around 3080 10gb vram nvidias card amd seller everyone buy release usually people wait least aib card expecting amd start revealing stuff either anyway sept 17th exactly right console bringing new blood year rdna2 representative average consumer waiting rdna2 buy either think price screaming rdna2 actually competitor let wait see let honest amd impressing anyone nvidia flagship card amd people settle take release rdna2 leak pcb shroud anything remember 5700xt leak used know blower fan 3 month release knew 8 gb card pcb shot people dissecting pcb even single word yet rdna2 vr benchmark gpu know gamers 500 sitting around rn ever nvidia going sell million 30 series card next month two completely saturate market relax well definitely needed good reason lower price much could know something amd plan maybe new console speculated around 500 would offer really great perf ratio full system would bad nvidia pull new gpu 30 better 300 price personally think reason nvidia showing good right amd competing nvidia feel pressure doubt 3000 would price seeing today hopefully amd continue compete saying nice nvidia improved card saying hope amd improve way sure amd even compete much prefer amd gpu hackintosh holy shit nvidia card slightly cheaper 2000 series cut price perf half simply doubling performance keeping price amd held card close perhaps something compete far better think anybody expecting amd might find another radeon 7 position simply slash price lower without taking loss afford nvidia much larger buying bulk cheaper inferior samsung probably cheaper contested tsmc course much deeper wallet need take loss interesting see amd respond use 5700xt given right mean going buy inferior product support company prefer stay competitive drive price rather silly statement need card price range amd offer better value sense paying buy nvidia show amd lesson saying fine paying yeah vote wallet amd support open source linux driver dum say vote wallet 8 year ago one amd ahead cheaper guy want amd make better card buy hope nvidia card cheaper witch buttf k ti 100 still buy idk rtx 3080 performance 16gb ram 599 sound good thats amd almost went voting wallet good need able handle bad launch intel due release gpu 2023 ampere good slide show amd might able handle bad gpu gen right say buy nvidia amd fall short amd worry gpu least console cycle might great high end least hold bit mid low range doubt intel gpus going competitive high end either first attempt logic amd competitive cpu side either market share 35 intel 65 hoping amd least stay competitive mid range keep nvidia pricing check bit buy amd support buy value make sense performance want amd get steamrolled time worried rtx4000 nvidia feel threatened able raise price amd competition voting wallet limited never implied say go buy amd gpu help stated worry amd might able compete make thing pricier future tbf kinda expected even basic 550w psu handle 300w gpu hawk ebay bit picked 1200w corsair 75 make sure cable could run 3 card thing easily saying option might even score 850w even le next gpu series supposed cut power 50 performance use titan rtx deep learning linux 5k2k used 2080ti 970m steamos computer never slightest issue nvidia say deep learning running better window mindset linux still got crucial tool window use wayland back yeah read somewhere think even ltt mentioned jensen disappointed sale turing guess price mining craze disappearing nvidia competition area easy

garbage comparison sure nvidia would fine samsung tsmc 7nm given fact oh yeah guess really bimpson heh step pricing flagship card 1 500 agree technically flagship titan le confusing name said marketing 300 2080 ti well yeah 1000 le titan rtx replaces presumably 3080s refresh replace 2080ti care nomenclature nvidia us bald fact releasing top ampere gaming gpu substantially last gen midst global pandemic 1000 le absurdly priced last gen though brazen laughing laughing nervously sweet baby jesus could really use competition amd right oh yeah im still going wait amd fire shot two 3070 performs real world anything claimed 2080ti level thats compelling proposition take work beat 90 appear titan replacement year trying push hah true people short memory attention span find people remember people interested immersed hobby keep track stuff everyone else casual normal busy whatever generally applies everything life gpus 1070 performance 980ti think wait bit discord server bunch moron freaking omg amd ded holy shit hour later sane realizing nvidia whole lot smoke mirror 330 970 replaced outgoing 1000 titan fixed shit dont even expect see 970 esque pricing amazing actually even back standard 400 pricetag would great nope 500 x70 card bargain century smh gotta honest though chief miss fact could buy 1080 505 2016 still 2014 seems someone told 6 month ago could rtx 2080 ti 499 bought heartbeat course assuming 3070 faster 2080 ti efficient really amd claim new generation 50 efficient end day performance compared amd 480 580 series atrocious navi card epic failure offered shitty performance amd thought could away riding ryzen bandwagon people stupid either finally stomp amd real question someone bought 5700xt august correct corollary statement made wait wait duh someone looking unreal engine month ago fair comparison game epic game test run new unreal engine feature fortnite unreal engine 5 coming early next year massive improvement across board including performance special nvidia top unreal engine fair reflection gpu would run engine sold 2080ti 950 paid 920 last year ofc im buying 3080 699 win win one always ride hype without ordering thing launch wait benchmark nvidia stock jumped around 10 friday tuesday yeah people freaking hell hopefully see similar improvement amd side thing specified nvidia website individual card eg 3080 performance tab tensor performance upscale quickly hmm actually exactly double definitely diminishing return cuda core performance right seems smaller expected cuda core must main bottleneck find odd keep talking 1 9x efficiency true card tdp 2080 produce 90 performance assuming 3080 90 faster 2080 debatable still clearly us 100w 2080 efficiency claim b looking another way able 2080 ti performance half power 2070 get 2080 ti performance tdp 30w le 15 le power far cry 50 difference waiting 25 month waiting 3 month especially going spend 1200 guess people got steal high end gpus lol yeah yep pretty much still gtx 980 play 1080p still decent enough incentive last two generation also non trivial number gamers g sync monitor fully compatible radeon gpus lose adaptive refresh feature whole point buying display right pricing response nvidia amd still unknown product nvidia scared brought u 1080 ti pricepoint vega 64 hype lul tbf vega64 bad tweaking miner made sure one could buy one game morelikely turing way overpriced retardly overpriced rtx meme reason console nvidia competes people consider pc new generation console nvidia amd given amd whats making new console comparison though really

thinking big navi ryzen 4700x bundle would quite nice justifiable perhaps nice surely depends sort game playing slightly rtx 2080 non super priced accordingly release might discontinued recent search

tsmcs 7nm per wafer imagine made deal nvidia betting yield increasing big time usually couple month probably 80 honestly amd nvidia stock point performing great mega church preacher lmao nobody using stimulus cheque buy company share using pay bill buy food saying poor people know ton people worse lot saying game high end pc hit hard pandemic think comment meant everyone fired job okay plenty higher income people also hit would bought something nivida called 3080 flagship stream probably nixed ti time around meanwhile started talking 3090 opened history titan card clearly demand product 3090 look titan replacement would technically significant drop price tier product nvidia lmao debating financial sense putting example someone making 700k year thanks laugh think single person making 700k year lmao ampere titan far 3090 1000 cheaper titan rtx higher price tag opposite yeah bad though time seems fe price aib card supposedly know scalper availability performance could stomach beginning new console cycle nvidia keep price competitive console locked amd stack certainly obtain apu refresh mid late cycle microsoft already committed frequent refreshes entirely new design waiting review sorely tempted buy first console since ps2 crossplay etc win10 ecosystem one available brother visit home bar ah well time dip life saving make sweet living selling subpar product loathe undeniably smart somewhere talking malice ethic see relevance link missed comma land mongol want exterminate race though term race modern invention mongol many invader problem systematically exterminating entire ethnic group opposed roman thing city surrendered would grant generous term anyone resisted entire city would massacred surviving woman child would sold slavery mongol want

honestly really matter entire village town nation raped tortured enslaved summarily executed really matter victim reasoning behind horrible act let fair excuse nazi conquer europe solely wanted rid

even use x86 even architecture cant run software xbox o based window 2000 dont really see could call xbox computer good faith yeah console streamlined gaming box pc 2080 ti average 30 faster 2080 3080

competing arm risc v whatnot design catching quickly apple cpu graviton ampere nvidia cpu company etc x86 kind holy grail console end lead back amd anyway even gpu price make somebody walk away pc

coffeelake 10700k cometlake spewing bullshit neck rendering benchmark intel still supreme gaming game 20 increase fps say intel improved ten year simply true know improved much comparison amd everything except gaming flat say improved ten year make sound cpu today 15 faster cpu 8 year ago fake news fact straight surprised surprised driver sucked major dick comaprision nvdia confident rdna2 looking good would nvidia change name price titan amd going least close 3080 win unless trying claim performance crown strange much expensive 3090 twice much 3080 20 percent better performance amd touting 2x performance per watt even perfect scaling p w work would twice performance 5700xt 2080 ti already 50 faster 5700xt 4k mean unless amd underselling investor amd top end inbetween 3070 3080 performance amd throw make another 350 400w card though could give 3080 run would likely make nvidia issue 3080 ti response history dictate going happen though exactly nvidia went back old price performance tactic 3070 solid product fair price seems 1080ti way worth know actual pricing aib yet could end cheaper still think need house order saying better part decade amd marketing keep reaching new low hardly said word zen nothing substantive zen 2 mention radio silence zen 3 silence defacto bad choice content waiting see amd offer watching showing see anything 3080 probably end buying 3080 sony microsoft leverage nvidia amd ball nvidia releasing console killer sub 400 3060 amd quiet generate little hype possible sony microsoft secure volume sale holiday season think aib launch time team red gpus ever since got rid gts 8800 think gotta go green gen losing quite sometime figured hope finger crossed wised holding breath either product delivers bravado done favor past would different people buy nvidia always buy nvidia part start know also let main competitor know launch company worth salt would something stupid nvidia brand loyalty war decade ago prudent thing stay quite hit big

pretty significant difference know tflops end indication think running xbox slightly faster could make 7tflops right end day someone pay engineer someone pay ad someone pay utility factory tax last

whole rtx feature set brainer team green sure work great plus really good freesync one work green good one well kinda hard find example lg 27gl850 great brand agnostic worse respect true gsync one mostly variable overdrive vrr range close probably one better panel currently 7nm better nvidia architecture way ahead amd also pay lot le samsung 8nm v tsmc 7nm amd compete price node help ton seen nvidia beat amd using bigger node problem yeah probably unfortunately little money console hardware though company hardware supplier console barely make profit nvidia probably make profit one standalone video card amd make 5 10 console launch price difference 5700 xt v 2070s 100 would hard see amd price 3070 competitor le 400 yep thing interested fe card rdna2 reference card aib design

extra cost much power dedicate infinity fabric make relatively large amount power consumed zen chip mention latency issue imagine see epyc gpu cluster compute cross connected large shared cache infinity cache step towards weighing pro con chiplet approach versus large monolithic chip everyone want sell pricier stuff first three card mentioned appear using die unlikely amd making one die 6700 appear sometime likely current 5000 series card either slot new lower price bracket refreshed lower sku 6000 option worth adding presentation especially since everyone begging compete top nect year probably always start high end stuff something way surely older card drop price significantly better buying older card mid range card case believe gamers nexus video subject think 2060 first mid range card time actually worth price wait bit nvidia 3070 close 500 expect drop 500 next month preach sapphire 5700xt exact price point powercolor base 5700 still excellent card 6700xt 6700 according rumor early next year bump boat expected lower end card compete nvidias 3070 ala almost half tier higher price wise lol u consumer gotta shell big buck joke aside sure 6700 3060ti price range yet really need xd high end card usually come first cheaper model come time keep eye evga bstock today got 2080s 475 tax last week deal went live 8pm est last week exactly got 980ti 400 year release oprah didnt imagine benchmark include ray tracing plus used rage memory thing iit 6800 seems quite bit faster 2080ti 6800 seems consistently beat 2080ti 3070 manage gn review show 3070 falling 2080s 2080ti consistently 6800 really 3070 competitor 3070 ti competitor amd number legit clearly outperforms 3070 3070 competitor 6700 navi22 tbf 3070 nvidia 2nd tier gpu ga104 generation nvidia would called 3080 3080 would 3080ti 3090 would titan since best gpu ga102 3070 ti 6800 competitor 6800 better performance 3070 thing ryzen 5000 buy expensive one lol 3080 competitor concerning raytracing huge selling point nvidia gpus amd similar result going hurt casually mentioned also raytracing subclause guess want focus much one area nvidia still may beat honest playing shooter cyberpunk wouldnt sacrifice framerates ray tracing use screenshots maybe casual exploration even without shared access memory feature 6800 faster 2080ti 3070 sam give another 5 boost 16gb vram also help brainer really may slower game yet 3070 cant say 16gb ram way mire future proof one would think linus said new 6k card 500 mobos zen 3 additional performance boost fall 3070 3080 performance even without zen 3 according benchmark obv wait full review usual tech site selected game right developer need adapt iirc term raw performance yes zen 3 rdna 2 smushes together quite nicely main advantage though extra vram consumes le power cooler smaller nvidia think buy whatever includes samsung 980 pro ssd first lazy build rig lulz good hear satisfied announced cheer exactly thought think taking extra time work new amd feature 50w le tdp lmao need better think mentioned outperformed 2080ti faster 3070 good amount 3070 matching 2080ti time 6800 beat 2080ti yeah sad think buy 650 one might well difference le 100 card recent test maybe compare 2080ti seems fair must think beat 3070 significantly card going sell stock price guess saw opportunity extra 80 card going well little better card strategy want product competitor value buy yea weird probably see 6700 6700xt point 15 20 faster 250w 16gb vram worth extra 50 dollar imo dusted 2080ti freaking 11gb card still believe sure worth weight gold 3070 match 2080 ti 6800 20 higher nvidia comming 3070 ti 3070 20 faster rtx 2080 ti though seen yeah comparing overclocked card stock card kinda odd 3090 still look faster given 3090 10 15 faster 3080 gap 6800xt 6900xt look even smaller yep definitely rage mode committed murder free harambe kush score hidden save 500 dollar actually glad cancelled order 3080 point thing smart access memory need b550 zen3 much leap since everyone afford a1k dolar card upgrade zen3 asap anyway agreed expect stock stock 3090 win took best case amd exclusive feature enabled amd cpu nvidia worst dl raytracing 500 haircut though still compelling feature use ryzen gpu give 3 13 performance gain good since people use ryzen anyway mean stuff turned amd give boost 13 best case scenario 3090 cost 50 even turned still crazy close lot le money plus vram except 6900xt 3090 everyone say make sense pay 16gb vram future proof 3070 yeah thought think would lower sure nah 3070 competitor rx 6700xt equal 3070 rumor 3070ti 6800 compete amd offer similar better baseline performance cheaper left forget claim take consideration rage mode smart access memory think 6800 pricing give amd flexibility lower pricing rumored revised 30xx card come play q1 q2 2021 nvidia aka ti super amd lower 6800 529 549 range counter possible 3080 3070 ti super yeah normal 6800 cheaper custom design meaning third party card really technical detail possible fact amd develops manufacture cpu gpus allows bake sort functionality nvidia manufacture cpu intel manufacture gpus would require sort partnership order develop technology work hand hand found comment u doommaster basically expanding heterogenous memory access cpu read write vram gpu read write cpu ram console single memory set still advantage degree getting closer explain 14 difference 3080 3090 go short overkill competitive good thing 3070 match 2080ti 6800 need outperform 2080ti 3070 apparently worth extra 80 kinda feel missed naming going 6800 6800xt instead 6700 6800 yeah term price sort 6800 16 gb ram roughly 15 20 faster 3070 2080ti honestly pretty close 3080 6800 rival upcoming 3070 ti super tier regular 3070 amd disabled dl raytracing benchmark nvidia would hold user benchmark decent chance nvidia slap ballpark price performance take factor consideration barely outperforms rtx 3090 500 cheaper highest gaming performance 500 le competitor bad say little bit disappointed 6800xt 650 600 fine dl software pretrained machine learning model amd easily deliver true everyone need remember rule feature highlight promo video assume going mediocre poor promos landing big hit area want people compare competition amd felt supersampling point compete dl would crowing know right 500 cheaper already enough eye lmao 3090 left original msrp fucking dead 6900xt price fine 6800 price disappointed rtx 3090 performance 1000 steal bullshit nobody say guy either deluded deliberately influenced competitor act unsub opinion mater mean look comment might wrong say working superresolution might dl alternative mentioned working getting super resolution game offer better performance using ray tracing maybe 1 allegedly coming jan driver update 2 good likely said nothing either telling enough p benchmark match leaked red gaming tech remember correctly said ray tracing performance par overall card look better value especially 6900xt betting ray tracing performance leave little desired see 15 35 keynote working super resolution feature increase performance major point concern 1 nope fancy bar graph gonna fly window dl 2 0 turned 2 one know bragging assume competitive rx480 live forever company switched model launch stupid expensive stuff first month later better price perf model 6700 6600 6500 appear point next year bigger segment pushed aside later use last year leftover amd cpu gpu 5000 gpus nvidia done since 1000 series playing 1080p care 120 fps amd nvidia nothing next year maybe sama cpu announcement really deflated since kept budget stuff raised prefix l price announced partially finished first build ever couple week ago grabbed 3600 175 announced 200 220 probably would gotten current gpu buddy old 580 sill need gpu decided something 400 would instant buy left waiting may look older 20xx nvidia drop price trying high fps 1440p monitor 144 refresh probably 6700xt 6700 release sometime next year miss 60 series card 200 price range next year likely 5700xt high end last gen early next year likely iirc meant supplant rx 5000 series someone correct wrong never much tbp 3080 bit confused achieve 6800xt 6900xt tbp probably far 3080 1440p fookin ell think set price nvidia revealed 3070 yet price drop compete 3070 anything 5700 good overclocker might yeah would knockout 499 definitely beat mostly cross board given photo keep mind compared overclocked 6900xt fancy new memory sharing thing stock 3090 6900xt likely still bit slower 3090 zen 3 cpu overclock rage mode shown graph smart access memory thing rage mode activated otherwise 3090 better performance also lack nvidia feature talk much ray tracing today going wait review number looked high sure number without rtx rly showcase ray tracing performance kinda concerning rt comparison comparison made radeons rage whathever mode overclocked consequence bit outdated efficiency rdna2 even better report power required taken gpu yah noticed think people missed 300 watt 6900xt total board power total board power 3090 350 watt complain much wish 6800 would 549 another wish hear 6700 series 30 579 card nothing afford extra 30 card probably buying 500 gpu begin according amd 6800 15 18 faster 2080ti 3070 trade blow 2080ti loses quite title least gn video leaf room 6700xt fit probable 3070 competitor imo actually make sense nvidia developing new sku 3070ti competition 6800 1440p believe smart access memory enabled 18 higher performance 2080ti average according amd claim lost without sam enabled however small lead would cool kinda doubt people start making plan based announced price making best strategy imo slightly faster slightly money tough call imo doubt price drop release way nvidia dropping price even keep product shelf right lol prolly right everything seen far agreed difference 6800 6800xt narrow price right even price enough performance make 6800xt irrelevant unless heavily invested 4k high refresh gaming called super resolution showed new feature fidelityfx time tell look good dl 2 0 mentioned something similar go detail currently one know far progress hardware unboxed give depth explanation basically similar dl result method cautiously say ready next year super resolution ready yet briefly mentioned working something event 5600xt went 200 amd would budget gpus bag couple month unlikely tho also heard rumor 5700 non xt entering production ago sooo exactly shame 6800 look checking 5700xt hopefully drop next couple week really depends stock set 3080 still waiting see amd releasing former even option lol card actually buyable huge amd many people cancel 3080 3090 preorders 3080 supersampling amd talked work every game vr probably going 6900xt sell 3080 900 100 better card meme mode money unless going go 6900 fine real meaningful difference 6800 3080 point aside small price difference whatever actually best right mean everyone saying wait see amd gonna lol rest system look cpu overclocked many harddrives stuff researched bit topic already 650w psu probably try 3080 seems still enough power support system gaming load think safely keep 750w psu run problem normal high load circumstance quite honestly nobody know except amd possible amd conservative power recommendation alternatively could keeping quiet watt munching beast ultimately depends power consumption pc whole slapping 6900 rig 15w laptop cpu probably fine got old amd fx9590 overclocked gonna issue rtx 3090 us bit 400w according guru3d even us much see 6900 using much example ryzen 3900 measured peak 142w add 100w leeway rest system looking roughly 650w actual power usage good quality 750w psu manage day higher power psu may run efficiently efficiency curve tend look gentle hill peak around 60 max power would also putting le load component psu may longer lifespan psu however personally think huge issue probably away 750w fine 750w make sure good psu seasonic corsair assuming rage mode may pull 300w thats reason recommending 850w psu however could totally wrong wait review said pairing whats cpu motherboard ssd pci e slot configuration play part determine psu worth build amd 3600 evga 2080ti black prime p x570 motherboard aio probably 6 8 fan commander pro 16gb ram corsair rmx 750w gaming load overclocks went around 400w plugged electric meter buy older gpu sorry hear tecktober strike yes ray tracing caveat quite nvidia implementation game functionality gathered main issue concern performance new card showcase much bit concerning dx12u card core far universal brand raytracing 6800 across board point developer start designing around honestly take long xboxsx let alone ps5 amd box element gpu baked raytracing capability included wait bench might better ryzen 5000 cpu 500 series motherboard 6800xt say ryzen 5000 best gaming cpu one know also obligatory rtx voice alternative would possible consider people two huge try rtx background yet whatever called still buy gpu ofc rtx voice fcking godsend u amateur streamer absolutely amazing point becoming one defining factor ray tracing going big thing console supporting demanding ray tracing also need good upscaling people say bout dl rt play game control game alone cyberpunk 2077 ever release reason many people upgrading marketing people 3990x wanting 5xxx avg gaming 5g got real rt look amazing control metro exodus dl definitely cool yeah raytracing know people care much generation basically kneecap fps jack shit limited selection game thought process well people making way big deal well talking highest end card generally people interested level card also want eye candy regardless many game currently support people still want able turn mention game coming around corner might also implement year people update gpu every new series people even skip two series vega intend keep instance rtx dl introduced 20xx series gaining popularuty even fast process amd time prepare answer rip scalper http kym cdn com photo image newsfeed 001 746 178 c0e png mean ready month working properly optimized anything versus competition people hear said working dl type feauture yeah mean crap buying gpu feature even far enough show demo lmao fuck edit mention nvidia far leader machine learning even close mention ray tracing expected xbox working thanks directml api yea think right already people claiming matter though major upcoming game wait people saying dl needed either neither matter amd trying develop answer word stream encoder update nvenc one nvidia killer feature easily worth extra lot people yeah main concern already 3080 still return period hoping hear rt performance faster rasterization great basically every major next gen title support rt care card run best feature turned also still pushing ca clear competition dl expect eventually see something disappointed nvidia broadcast also really great far liked saw see worry sure many people actually care ray tracing much measure ray tracing performance good ray tracing look purely qualitative went nvidia first time 20 year generation maybe got unlucky card unstable adobe gpu render case expect perfect say fixed said 20 faster 2080 ti pretty equivalent 3070 expensive also faster beat 3070 check 4k benchmark came 3070 shown independent review slower 2080ti game compare slower card 6800 beating 2080ti beating 3070 rip nvidia 3070 8gb vram realize 4k amount vram enough especially upcmojg title right 6800 16gb said beat 2080ti 18 considering 3070 half vram would say price fair 3090 always veblen good beat 3070 3080 look awkward spot 3070 3080 beat 3070 performance worth 80 however fit well spend extra 70 xt justification dat 16gb vram tho sold mine 2200 lol waitmarks bench yea wait getting dammit yall know patience probably 6600xt work compete 3060 nvidia amd probably supply constraint issue right try find used rtx2060 vega series cheap called xbox series x pc gaming dead value perspective enthusiast dropping 999 gpus right considering great value price war luckily 4k 60fps console available 499 leverage 5600xt exactly understand people buying amd availability issue nvidia card issue going come mean 15 faster twice v ram great value let wait benchmark really weird amd flip table hard intel nvidia value king 2021 10400f 3070 tempting build option welcome microcenter find everything looking ok 12 02 gang playback speed bottom right edit forgot add bring back normal speed every couple second seems 16 aye bad good geez press f pay respect rip 3090 hell yeah brothee 500 buck le 3090 good mean 3080ti come le nvidia want compete properly glad see undercutting nvidia much really bring much innovation 3090 comically overpriced lmao probably since rtx 3090 overpriced compared rtx 3080 already nvidia priced 3090 high 5900x better value 5800x 5600x value say definitely crash 3090 though economics lot purchasing decision actually hinge encoders improved likely buying literally argued friend account 6000s tensor core analogue awesome source find virtual super resolution edit found one example nevermind forgot sure hope stuck upgrading 5600xt encoder run quest2 wired wireless said 500 series mobo mean pci e 4 0 likely required 500 series board console thing x200b http youtube com watch v 0xuiopslrka tsmc say yes edit age well rip still know nvidia push 3090 gaming card compute best cu much difference gaming wise maybe 5 top head shit thought 3090 3080 ram sli pretty much true 3090 around 8 faster game compared 3080 6900xt also seems much faster 6800xt 6900xt rage mode smart mode enabled show benchmark 6900xt without around 10 faster 6800xt without rage mode smart mode probably mean actually around 5 8 faster asking thing considering switching encoder big least rdna 2 architecture video codec acceleration including least hevc h 265 h 264 vp9 av1 codecs amd amf including dedicated hardware encoders still quite good al nvec lot better older iteration yes dv1 encoding used xbox 50 efficient h 264 probably big step rdna1 encoding maybe slightly worse nvidia offer took 6 month decent driver nvidia memory bandwidth higher speed memory bigger bus amd make back special 128mb cache however still know well cache work every game yet gddr6x faster dram gddr6 problem rn one company make high demand low supply mean high cost another side effect low supply low supply thing need one reason 3080 3090 launch bad amd using infinity cache 2 9x speed gddr6 128 mb help spike load let card compete nvidia joint venture micron nvidia nvidia access bit faster also power hungry run hotter ya know expensive really easier reach vram capacity limit vram bandwidth issue guessing eventually add support apple whatever reason strangely good supporting amd card 267mm length highly suspect also higher binning depends wanted since cf pretty much dead gaming oh room needed heating without pc could play part 2 yea feel ryzen 1000 series moment definitely competing still beating market leader look happened year cpu side ryzen 5000 pretty swiftly beat anything intel maybe year time see thing gpu side although faith nvidia keep competition intel 6800xt par performance 3080 memory us le power huge win deffo buying amount naysayer thread sea dumb people combined salty nvidia fanboys honestly got 3080 day launch mad real competition trading blow firing offer best price performance offer right people expected wanted rdna 2 slap ampere around realize process much done year going 5700xt 6900xt crazy considering even 2080ti type product reference take account nvidia advantage financially r stuff rdna 2 feat objectively speaking dunno 6800 xt 50 dollar cheaper value smaller form factor 16gb find attractive thought 3070 8gb vram 6800 double vram 80 also need see real street price pan availability even 6gb vram 3070 small correction rtx 3070 8gb gddr6 ram change point course 3070 8gb vram 6gb lol see 6900xt v 3090 non gaming task 3090 gaming card atleast 10 gaming performance 3080 power latest titan right well 6900xt j misleading rage smart access turned also 16gb g6 memory v 24gb g6x 3090 thank sane sudden people want act make break feature 12 hour ago one really gave shit dare bring real world logic everyone hyper focused number number comparison nanosecond single digit frame rate tbh cyberpunk right around corner pretty sure many people want new gpu play raytracing yeah adoption understand early adopter always gonna want every new feature time cutting edge tech raytracing become norm question going happen within generation card much missing x200b speculation increased power new console generation would allow devs incorporate raytracing console game would lead boom generation skeptical see play 90 gamers tell dl idk tech sub think important sell card dont even rtx card feature consumer head forever tech industry play rt enabled game mean count feature must dont dont know people argue something thats case specific rather feature ya know 3080 6800xt equal raw performance 50 apart rather spend 50 extra feature game support dl rt look better perform better 3080 want wait see rt performance super scaling feature competes dl rt stay people spending 600 700 gpu going want going play two game forever eventually buy new one dl going major feature moving forward even well outside 2021 probably buy 2 4 everybody else showed heck edit ayye 1070ti gang mean wow gonna 6900xt well want top top going boy attitude someone actually brainwashed know amd showed today benefit u long run actually idea exact boat spirit steam index miss back old day amd ati yeahhhhj yeah seems obvious move sure thing need implemented go see maybe seeing know back red upgrade build next year start new ryzen next year maybe upgrade vega64 hopefully rage mode button older vega well lol amd flood market inventory would benefit real buyer make extra sale scalper holding win buyer team green know faster rtx 3080 6800 actually buy ya denial think amd stock problem 100 yep overall excited card show ray traced yes need ram gaming overall 5 10 faster card 15 money yeah agree want buy rtx 3070 rx6800 perfect need good ray tracing amd card hand nvidi dl people forgot simply unthinkable card 800 year ago hard sell future proofing double vram performs slightly better 3070 right matter term cost performance simply cost performance much extra vram something precisely 6800 steal much future proofed 3070 8gb ram oc also 3070 cant really wild 3080 appears sadly look conspiracy debunked still seeing stock everywhere doubt see hopefully wrong betting around 449 6700 rule never spend 500 single piece hardware pc continue sit one something meet budget card look great though scammed 3080 price ple evga 3080 1169aud leaning towards nvidia still depends whether hand 6800xt launch dude drop 3080 right 5600x 6800xt much better fps going 3080 best save cashola 1820 aud 3080 going 1000 6800xt might go decision would obvious pricing confident 6800xt available au msrp 999 card 6900xt 6800xt amd support linux reason buying amd card even behind thing raytracing awhile since game use rtx worry standard versus nvidia extension screw ps5 kinda feel point 6800 15 expensive rtx3070 le 10 faster another 5700xt v 2070 super story reversed dl rtx argument valid yet meh every review somehow show dl sharper native image game see review show plainly blurrier worse spent 25 year gaming attempting rid blur going enable blur higher frame rate fuck noise literally term brainer 6900xt cost full 54 6800xt going offer probably 8 15 performance improvement depending game game limited rops bandwidth limited game extra 8 cu going much another game fully cu limited better 6800xt brainer 6900xt 3090 absolutely disgusting price performance different 6900xt offered 45 performance cost 150 would different gaming experience 10 worth 15 increased cost imo brand new 69ooxt nice edition implication meanwhile still proud 1070ti uhh amd power gamers nvidia intel long shot underdog leading cpu marketing dogshit driver need worked think competing fine nvidia also need massively increase vram size amd offer 16gb 3090 offer whats worse leaked roadmap upcoming gpus 20gb 3070 heard nvidia dropping would awful gap nvidias line amd easily exploit long customer win end extremely happy gap 3090 3080 already small enough 3080 super ti would simply place hell would price

streaming live without amd would atleast need dl counter 1 likely 2080ti level 6800xt 2 yes 10 people want absolute best oh nice name 3 6900xt lack aibs launch probably come next year 4 think push far 2500 possible least 6800 2300 possible 6800xt 5 know fact tsmc affect much virus since lockdown know aspect tho 1 ray tracing would least par nvidia support new gen game engine ray tracing better case 2 really depends gonna card rlly incremental btw 3 usual partner 4 unclear atm 5 likely much better nvidia made statement measure going take able provide card buyer bot protection usual stuff rage

series especially paid msrp getting royally screwed whichever one actually buy sapphire model think 650 low enough beat 3080 thinking 650ish dude hope betting 650 tbh actually stock slaughter nvidia 16gb would nice right glad held patient gamer ftw 3090 ded nvidia price halo product anymore buying 6900xt point pricing shit besides card especially considering lack dl support extremely lack luster guess company high stock valuation x200b innovation ever hoping maybe nvidia cut price 3090 competitive hope got stock europe agreed marketing video card personal use 3090 overkill price point 999 got considering 6900xt even though initially good go 3080 hand one spatula 999 omg lol knew big gun 3090 number showed overlooking smart cache thingy say latter affect power usage bait wenchmarks know good even though probably loses thats okay 500 buck le spoiler alert clue probably l3 sharing afaik gpu memory vram lot quicker system memory card stupidly large 16gb amount vram especially somethuing 1440p give cpu memory quicker system ram use quicker memory cpu better cpu performance le bottleneck especially lower resolution 1440p speculation seems logical thing generally day launch still waiting zen3 benchmark 1 week away launch care amd nvidia make b benchmark want want see reviewer hand really see stack 30 series november 15th whenever release date usually couple day day launch sale nov 18 dec 8 gonna say worse ray tracing environment nvidia similar performance overall without fps crippling thats show bench rt showed game running rt performance figure tell fall far behind ampere good would boasting buy price scalped 3080 one play dl raytracing 1080ti happy dont fucking monopoly card overpriced decade bullshit intel finally balance force used dl mhw ray tracing never played

performance rumor point good ampere though guess amd sorta dodged comparison benchmark ray tracing present number rt clear number kosher nvidia shill bot chosen focus dampen hype video said coming week specific devs talk implemented feature card including ray tracing good ampere better turing bit want ray tracing likely better go ampere mind turning texture starter blame nvidia fuck company getting 144 fps make much difference hate lose expensive feature game matter really want keep monitor think 3080 would better fit 0 02 though turn gsync idea higher refresh rate monitor le noticeable tearing game super high fps gsync actually better latency believe gsync monitor automatically free sync one heavily considering rx 6800 xt currently gsync screen asus rog swift pg279q would lose gsync

without rage mode activated rage mode got another 5 13 improvement 6900xt number using rage mode smart access memory 6800xt number without function enabled believe slide showed number paired zen3 rage mode little number bottom 6900xt said slide rage mode memory access enabled willing bet rage mode work though 579 6800 649 6800xt 999 6900xt 649 dollar yes 6800xt 649 yes 649 ish think yeah price 580 650 1000 yeah 650 650 usd first post 649 believe 649 radeon rx 6800 xt available november 18th msrp 649 starting 649 release nov 18th budget option likely launch next year big boy go first make mark hope healthy competition best consumer need innovation otherwise another intel 4c 8t rtx2000 series situation think thats least impressive card honest x200b 6900 competes 3090 undercut 500 dollar insane x200b 6800xt competes 3080 undercut 50 dollar pretty good value x200b 6800 cannot way compete 500 dolar 3070 price 580 dollar time able compete 3080 performance sooooo whats card x200b also 3070 competitor sadly curious 400 500 range card shiettt forgot love sapphire trixx tech nice 49 monitor boost didnt work properly kek lmao radeon paired could easily performance pairing ryzen zen 3 radeon 6000 get optimised could easily see radeon 6000 5 15 increase look lot trading blow winning 3090 500 le let review come hold want dl raytracing specifically probably otherwise possibly driver still concern probably better wait till nvidia stock issue resolve company forced price cut probably shit happened july last year nvidia rushed refresh card super variant amd came perf around price shitload issue look steam survey see well 5700 5700xt v 2060 super 2070 super wafer capacity people stop buying expensive card thought 3080 ti cancelled bc need wafer regular 3080 first place lol would 3070 super 3080 super super shitty yelds samsung gddr6x memory price shit rushed product amd upped freq 200mhz node nvidia lowered 100mhz better one lol info show need full spec also hear amazed mention super resolution higher frame rate make dl type thing vsr thing year part current driver suite several year read description supersampling actually said nothing new feature except rage mode smart memory latter sounding good tho news upscaling video encoding new tech nowadays hard say midst technology change pandemic nvidia launch go well people starving product probably try hand radeon well unless amd got something sleeve likely hit supply issue question going handle preorders purchase control e g 1 per person household etc buddy got 5800xt lisa sue edition website launch day problem last year also ordered two zen 3 cpu launch problem hard say year gfx much exciting amd usually descent stock correct 500 series motherboards gotta force people buy new motherboards somehow might bios update announce want sell cpu 500 series motherboard 5000 series cpu think mentioned require 500 series motherboard maybe misheard x570 motherboard older 300 series cpu nope sol gonna need new cpu ram mobo compete 3080 pretty sure series x 52 cu slower 6800 yeah 750 plenty well little interesting card le wattage 3090 750w rec xt might significant spike people running 3090 750w sfx psu fine really hope nvidia lose market share gen amd support tensorflow outside rocm supported linux sure well vm work going switch nvidia nvidia way ahead ml 6800 enough 1440p 80 difference 6800 given rtx 3070 2 5 6900 6800xt 2 6800 2 2 5 6900xt 2 5 date release 1 day top several graph performance claim made already take smart access memory consideration would wait independent benchmark actually see important technology end say used ryzen 5900x probably 5950x 5900x come difference 4k 2k wait independent benchmark see nvidia responds price adjustment wait direct comparison benchmark interest upgrading 4k monitor yet currently rocking 1080p 165hz monitor gaming 3700x 2060 super feel really need 6800 xt non xt given price point know 8gb difference memory need rocking 1080p sure much benefit upgrading 2060 plenty though guess could benefit 8gb vram 1080p super low requirement vram compared 1440p 4k probably need upgrade playing 1080p might hit 144 fps 100 fps sure need better ray tracing performance streaming support answer amd yes answer nvidia 6800 better 2080ti 1440p performance sure need upgrade think fine people estimate psu need especially running oc ed high end processor try one psu calculator probably yes bronze certified psu guess fine 250w gpu 65w cpu mb ssd hdd go 400w draw really depends component might sure tx550 2x8pin think might limit let look tdp 5600x 65 w 6800xt 250 w motherboard around 50 w total around 365 w alright edit would oc though psu 2x rating three tdp rating together momentary power draw exceed tdp rating probably wait gamers nexus official review idle load power draw test exact result amd spec list 650w recommendation would look upgrading psu well luckily price starting come back 550w lot day unless budget build doubtful good titanium 700w good 800 gold 6800 non xt peak 300 whatever reason plus 150 estimate cpu ram already 450 plus mobo shit u dipping serious power drop territory even including amp draw 12v rail high 6800 likely peak 40 60amps anything 5600xt trip current protection ur pc shit say possible might away mean try worst happen pc shutdown psu deliver power gpu might corrupt window unlikely ur hardware damaged ocp work intended probably unfortunately think vrlink lived died 2000 series nvidia x200b standard made vr much better honestly sad disappointing vr company pick made adapter current headset according article long thing change please correct streaming still better nvidia card due nvenc codec 2 59 time faster amd vce h264 encoding gotta wait review see much boost smart memory really give update encoder match nvenc h265 encoder already decent reason there regression h264 would still recommend ryzen cpu nvidia ampere rtx gpu content creation broadcast app nvenc encoders good know nothing improvement amd encoder wager nvenc still superior feel ya man last system year ago used i5 4690k new rx 480 lol faster rtx 2080 ti doubt much stock yes wait benchmark buy worst case could always sell profit return buy throw fit believe see working 4k 120fps guessing without fall little behind 3090 guess would keep cost seem targeting specific value going larger quantity either mean complexity pcb 384 bit bus example obscene cost vram increase die size going fairly common 256 bit fairly standard vram likely large part allowing sell 6900 xt much cheaper 3090 binning dumb buy intel cpu already problem dumb work fine dumb completely interchangeable u amd processor 3080 matter 1070 paired r7 2700 tough say yet benchmark make clear would priced comparably nvidias rtx line absolutely benefit dl worse ray tracing rtx io sorry amd needed compete nvidia driver software support without straight brute forcing frame extreme latency go full amd 650 seems fine likely yes assuming cpu draw le 100watts probably though sure use website find run problem good quality psu likely depends spec believe tensorflow cuda nvidia tell work tensorflow pytorch box require nvidia cuda library done much amd card rocm enabled docker image believe community supported new version may delayed probably sli power really issue deep learning nvidia proprietary software cuda main problem used everywhere amd alternative level yet yeah hoping 3900x although wait see technology make improvement claimed upgrading anytime soon great cpu built complete different architecture doubt unfortunately 3900x might feature built guy 3700x 1 year great cpu plan upgrade also still x470 rage boost infinity cache thingy still undecided going nvidia amd rtx specific nvidia game need patched support dxr unknown whether also noted amd advertise raytracing performance whatsoever indicates underwhelming compared nvidia yup ray traceing rx 6800xt supposed good rtx 2080ti pretty good still 50 slower 3080 6800xt similar 3080 wont know till 3rd party benchmark available nothing really 4k 120 ultra new game announced 3 card comparison presentation also compare ps5 fps pc fps maxed setting cuz ps5 comparable medium pc setting dont ever consider console best possible setting maybe best budget even slowest new card 3070 6800 way faster ps5 even xbox series x faster ps5 best possible go 3090 cost 3 ps5s dont know rich ps5 closer 2070 5800xt 3080 competing newly announced 6800xt ps5 exist yet know people guess come close maxing anything probably around 4k 60fps click link scrub video find performance benchmark amd card nvidia card even slowest new card 3070 6800 way faster ps5 even xbox series x faster ps5 best possible go 3090 cost 3 ps5s dont know rich changing usually seriousness waiting euro pricing well 99 gsync monitor also freesync im pretty sure support freesync unless youre older version model bought predator predator x35 recently pretty locked gpu end bad freesync premium pro mediocre minimum hdr requirement would preferred probably found found similar monitor wanted freesync fine personally use 28inch run 2k 4k look much better jw usd sadly 6900xt 999 etc yes edit cash spend believe hype wait review think miss much streamlining internal pc boneheadedness swapping data gpu magical feature 16gb swapping data big issue 6900xt performance gain 6800xt minimal 350 gaining

right would 3090 might well wait see benchmark basically shit nvidia dl better driver amd double vram slightly better performance wish luck getting one hopefully bad last release bot setup tonight actually wish purchase one directx ray tracing api dxr supported hardware already announcement made vulkan ray tracing driver sure updated support vulkan ray tracing hardware support matter time big navi also known already support ps5 ray tracing api since sony o api confirms hardware ready api abstraction baked top via driver vulkan support ray tracing clue binning chip said generally company keep higher binned chip card aka amd founder card making card first ryzen processor clue 6900 higher end bin card referencing 3rd party partner card hardware tweaked amd design recommendation lot case given slight overclocks probably month away initial release good 5700xt serve well one running 1440p 100hz problem already done changed name 5600xt yet would say game demanding gpu u would better gain upgrading cpu zen3 u need see benchmark first 2600 1080 owner well zen 3 afraid requirement gpu rx 6000 series cpu ryzen 5000 series mobo 500 series a520 b550 x570 5800x cuz last longer cpu one component always recommend better version say 5800x budget longevity especially game becoming multithreaded 2 extra core might come handy especially running thing background base clock also higher price hike 3700x high say plan budget fence wait full review come making decision 5800x wasted money gaming especially 1440p identical performance 5600x many many year ever come point need core 5900x cheap 6900xt 1000 3090 1500 well right pretty much nobody buy card anyways thats something think 3070 lower performance 6800 also came nearly 1 month release hmm one go going cost country market mean getting great yield tsmc 7 nm surprise expect lot 6800xt stock move relative 6800 want encourage buyer looking 6800 able easily justify moving 6800xt course wrong 6800 cut 6800xt got 970 im buyjng 6800xt nov 18th shut nerd need muh flight sim fps though hoooooold http youtu faf5may1wow 100 agree people need patience end making best choice waiting bit mean holding back yeah probably cheaper card go console pay 500 plus tax next gen console inferior performance ok probably release card 6700 6500 etc better price dont price either tbh hey given fatser 3070 1200 buck 2080ti 6900xt nice00xt

console always sell loss breakeven compare 3070 15 perf compare 2080ti 3070 reasonable ask bit wtf smoking bro wtf compare gpu spec console btw definition rtx 3070 look good either since basically similar value rx 6800 agreed liked see 6800 bit lower price currently close 6800xt justify spending extra 70 getting 20 cu higher clock worry software mediocre case amd gpu personally 50 dollar difference big deal consider performance improvement software implementation nvidia technology application use working developing change sure hold breath need see nvidia reaction first 6900xt actually think 6800 supposed rival 3070 think 6700 xt looking 5700xt around 410 absolutely would made jump 6800 499 probably launching bit higher 5700xt still good card 2060 super hard find lot competition

intel nvidia stagnant competitive even objectively worse node probably voluntarily better margin oh man pathetic bunch chicken shit holy shit really mess ye hahahahaha dad must work amd wait 3070 saying 3080 320w 3070 220w 3070 also beat 2080ti 500 dl big feature 30 series card game enabled amd card compete loving competition lucky snagging 3080 6800xt sound great still since plan grab 5000 cpu curious see work together regardless force nvidia release 3080ti 1000 think interested see rt benchmark 6800xt though would love try amd card dl support game think 3080 ultimately much better think 6900xt average person willing spend gpu lot people even consider 3090 might 6900xt nah case likely employer get quadro supposed expert sound ray tracing stuff direct x tech sound weak way including rtx 3080 price still close amd decide one go depending benchmark reviewer personally amd software really record desktop instant replay stuff bfv ultra setting raytracing enabled default yes maybe impossible announce 8gb version point though imho unlikely performance level 8gb would waste likely 8gb lower priced budget card assuming announce later first half correct second half wrong one rt core per cu reducing number make gou faster slower rt since concurrently interesting point bit gamble back rasterization first started early 2000s nay sayers scoffed said heck would change render tech gimmick catch question rtx become mainstream nvidia edge currently amd release rt performance opposite rt meme technology 8 gb vram 10 15 higher perf actually priced quite nicely yeah explains

cu 6700 xt 10 slower 2080 ti 450 6700 400 6700xt surely lie within 280 350 range yes next month start pick know stock faulty chip yes sure nvidia done anything 3060 yet amd similarly bringing entry level card last dl work couple game right vr gen full 4k ready card want ai fake higher resolution playing 8k 15 performance well 16gb v 8gb vram think actual power play try find 500 2080ti better

playing next gen title 4k 8gb ram starting become bottleneck fine 1080p 1440p buy 8gb card 4k 6800 look could percent faster average although based 3070 2080 ti amd benchmark today 6800 outperforms 3070 better 1440p 4k 3070 cant let see 650 guess yes fast lucky much also 6800 supposedly faster x570 5000 series cpu might even quite bit faster 6800 simply badly priced greed since want push people 6800xt instead giving fake extra value comparison personally disappointed might bother upgrading double vram already problem resident evil 2 remake 8 gig vram would want yup canadian getting screwed shit dollar 6800 15 20 faster double vram complaining nope 4k60 really want 6800xt 3080 probs around similar numerical figure u valuation pre tax europe nvidia card priced 1 1 exchange rate reason amd

come rasterization performance trade blow depending game however ray tracing performance still air still little dl alternative 6800xt 3080 cheaper 6800 faster 3070 expensive 6900xt 3090 cheaper zen 3 cpu going amd gpu going huge plus nobody actually really know sure early say wait benchmark addition consider result game plan play ima guess 3090 gonna blow 6900xt water think amd strong enough gpu foothold beat 6800xt probably break 3080 3070 beat 6800 still betting nvidia getting better sale tho may choice anyway stock issue anything everyone else good decision decided early adopter first time ryzen still rocking 1700 really wish would waited zen3 never lol waiting see 6000 series wild thinking buying rx 580 still fine xd came ask need new gpu 3070 grab today event made consider holding use

cuda ruined opencl amd driver support opencl 2 opencl 3 pretty much killed opencl 2 built opencl 1 kinda sad opencl far behind cuda hopefully amd forey data center support gpgpu performance improves quickly go ahead buy 30 series mean rx 6900xts always amd cpu nvidia gpu well ever since pentium iii geforce 4 performance slide end accurate real world use case may finally amd especially since seem

mature 3600 literally reason upgrade cpu bottlenecked year build smaller budget say keep 3600 nail 3070 week go bit left budget swapping horrible idea pure gaming go ryzen 5600x radeon 6800 mean coroner 3090 pre order especially painful lol many unknown setup amd used benchmark think worth comparing benchmark tempering excitement see 3rd party review directly comparing everything concur price though 6900xt beast since interested nvidias extra feature implemented going amd 2080ti slightly faster 3070 average 6800 faster 2080ti may able justify price bump easily 3070 bit 18 rtx 2080ti said 3070 similar performance 2080ti mean rx 6800 double vram even though personally looking forward rtx 3070 nvidia rebating aib 3080 real pricing bring 550 nvidia reeportedly gave aib 50 rebate sold within 1st month release 3080 minimum 700 uk 18 faster 2080ti said performance 16gbs ram 8gb 16gb alone worth extra 80 technically better deal 3070 16gb 80 well probably used 2080ti 350 400 eur soon considering 6800 smashing 6800 weird wanted buy one might well pay 70 xt version instead 6700xt almost reach 3070 400 safe choice far expensive confused comment know 79 far expensive 8gb vram safe choice 6800 perform quite bit better amd slide trusted 80 dollar expensive around 10 20 performance sh sherlock event called gaming begin similar boat need graphic card also used deep learning project

3070 ravage mid end market waiting benchmark generally thought well folk would buy first place doubt many 6500 6700 card probably announced around ce version dl seriously doubt watching white paper nvidia generating research department last 5 year unfortunately amd insurmountable hill climb 2 minute paper covering nvidia tech year video good example ai core nvidia card huge deal much applaud amd

proprietary feature exclusive need pay game developer heavy money support remain pretty unpopular probably announced nividia announces 3060 close look release schedule past video card product release mainstream variant soon cannibalize high end sale historically normal lead generation release top end product deliver smaller dy later sure see q1 probably make enough card right release budget card expensive card sell anyway nah notice compare ray tracing also test done 5000 ryzen wrong amd let wait benchmark first would amd lower literally announced banking nvidia stock else would buy 6800 card likely better ray tracing pretty close non ray tracing 8 v 16gb memory probably issue anything lower 4k sure hope current look price 6800 think referring amd cpu gpu skus getting confusing make zero sense whatsoever considering 2070s sold better 5700xt 25 higher price minimal difference performance even sure price better price performance one year old card uncomfortable much faster 3070 lost credibility started moore law dead accurately predicted might right post take seriously talk 6800 3070 raw performance 6800xt going better buy proper cooling oc close 6900xt even bother buying nvidia card ray tracing always gimmick pc gaming lost term value company sell card anyway even compete considering long talked lol might still return window seriously considering rx6000 card 6 month ago least better people bought 2080ti ampere announcement really competitive offering nah dude 50 le msrp trade blow nvidia better developed raytracing dl really huge amd asking 999 graphic card telltale sign confidently beat rtx3080 shame go along milking consumer though could forced nvidia hand harder yeah mentioned version dl rumour heard coming christmas difficult say widely implemented though

offer complementary product dissapointing 4k 60fps card cost 600 tax amd rtx3700 offer better deal smoking alright go buy one right r nvidia allows post relation nvidia gpus make sense remebering amd performance card marketing moment real world benchmark r amd exact thing sub general gpu cpu information amd show 5900 xt near time better performance 3090 2 3 cost mean matter 6900 xt actually hold

mindshare yet coin verb ryzen along 3 4 year intense market disruption depends well amd software match nvidia dl 2 0 rtx still better suspect lot think 3070 3080 safe sorry noob question direct competitor 3070 6800 definitely rip 3070 still amazing performance cheapest new gen card amd literally opted showing benchmark ray tracing nvidia dl going favor kind expecting come 50 cheaper 3080 esp showing rt performance honestly shrug interesting take considering showed raytracing benchmark dl competitor would pay 50 extra 2 feature ez mentioned super resolution still development super resolution literally talk half second fact 6900xt 30 cheaper basically 4k performance mean nothing 500 cheaper win anyway rx 6800 double amount vram 8gb vram probably suitable 4k 3070 yeah everything else least made sense except 6800 pricing chart showed smart access rage mode yeah amd probably banking 3070 selling 500 much inflated price could response expected shortage 3070 stock given seen 3080 3090 supply mention dl competitor mentioned unless blind rip amd budget market control 6800 twice vram 3070 might banking value people plus suspect price drop come nvidia release 3070ti showed 6800 maybe 10 15 better 3070 amd said 6800 18 faster 2080ti 17 19 faster 3070 16 higher price double vram seems pretty fair think rtx 3080 similar performance 2080ti right 6800 exist make price 6800 xt look better introduce cheaper model drop 6800 price later barely beating even see chart better card far ml still nvidia game framework using cuda hole cuda ecosystem established early exactly waiting

nvidia point anymore price zen3 reflected already somewhat competitive product promise feature coming later future kinda banking pricing might change nvidia give response need wait saying watching

game since tied nvidia game rtx far way amd going show dl result give nvidia 40 advantage plus ray tracing must tanking card since show number gap going widen rtx would made point tell u hope pretty close want show bunch loss graph spend gpu 400 amazing mean discount 5700xt owner never anything nvidia mean new feature 6000 series might trickle rdna 1 card seem way new feature seem hardware bound exclusive new generation resale value still decent 6800 580 count need spatula card need aib design despite amd saying us 300w going use way 300w amd nvidia make gpu board traditionally partner sapphire make reference model likely aib model buy stock 6900xt tbh probably launch supply limited actually bit surprised lineup mean impressed totally expected 6700 well personally tend go middle card lowest cheapest model also flagship top line model either lower tier chip undoubtedly used next gen console see 6600 6700 card except maybe 6800 think 80 3070 make bit harder sell course wait real world benchmark well might 3070 due wallet reason 6800 15 3070 really depends benchmark bet better 2060s nowhere close 3080 honestly still prefer rt performance idc ray tracing played metro exodus gameplay account 99 immersion rather ray light lol radeon rx 5700 xt probably get dropped price rumor say q1 next year tried streaming vce reasonable solution saying good nvenc use 5700xt non streaming video encoding work better 1070 50 faster nvidias nvenc codecs godsend think amd always done late game play well catch eventually better answer best bet probably nvidia amd something called

anything mate wait sell 3080 later going 3080 probably going 1000 january 2021 hang odds scalper going go crazy big navi well unlikely least still keep 5700xt production totally different price bracket stop production add 6700 xt see game play recent driver 5700xt use year old driver game load go another company think dec hear lower card hoping 6700 xt named would good proposition honestly think 5 time either setup sam stuff probably reason somewhat regret rtx 3080 purchase since getting 5900x although machine learning toolbox start supporting opencl stick nvidia think amd first maybe see aib 6900xt next year well new console run amd claim ray tracing willing bet ray tracing supported pc hardware well 50 3080 think price moved coming back maybe good gpu 250 300 dollar welcome pc gaming 2020 luckily xbox series x delivering 4k 60fps gaming 499 know pc day gtx 1060 rx 480 forever gone 6800 80 8gb vram gddr6 10 gb last year imagine gone much since well 3060ti confirmed china yesterday prolly 399 though think price already leaked nvidia suggested msrp go higher 400 doubt card either manufacturer reach low budget generation msrp go plenty option already though 1060 3gb remember correctly slightly slower rx 580 turn 50 slower rx 5600xt showed tpu database 5600xt 100 580 67 5600xt 50 faster 580 1660 super 1660 ti 2060 5700 5700xt viable upgrade deliver substancial performance uplift much le 4x price want buy sku latest generation wait month announce release scott said coming mentioned super resolution suspect still working driver sdk first mention anything mentioned radtechgaming video big dec driver update might include first iteration agreed hopefully many bug since evolution rdna architecture fear last time owned amd card 9 year ago driver bad hope thing improved 0 problem nvidia wait benchmark come 3070 looking fine still cheaper 6800 seen 2 compared performance 3080 3090 hand still better 6800xt 650 look good dl presumably better rt performance v double vram 80 sadly word hardware encoder decoder careful 6900xt score fine print say rage mode smart access memory best case scenario performance somewhat lower u problem difference 3080 3090 lot 3080 still attractive considering plus nvidia 6800xts purpose sell defective chip 6900xt set clock tbp memory configuration ignore nvidia real card gen would vanilla 6800 6900xt still pretty cool see 6800 mopping floor 2080ti 3070 wonder rumor nvidia going panic mode 3070ti pricing netflix budget option really scraping change together mid tier really want high end niche 6800 seems terrible price 16gb v 8gb 15 20 higher performance 3070 pricing inline really buy rage mode think got 7 8 3090 overclock really much different since essentially gpu overclock top excuse put gpu overclocks slide far see one game went outside normal bound still sticking 3090 getting 5950x though lack ray tracing talked dl top make wonder little difference change matter 3070 le vram roughly 2080ti 3070 scam marketing 2x perf real third party benchmark showed 3070 beat 2080ti much sometimes ti even better 3070 amd release proper benchmark 2x perf actually show 6800 bos 2080ti 3070 6800 vram better clockspeed amd market leader gpu price 6800 580 dollar mean really confident card compared 2080ti cause number 3070 yet think compared 2080ti due nvidia pushing back launch obviously amd exactly sent reviewer sample card nvidias msrp lie though sure people 3070 500 majority paying 550 600 find founder edition also 6800 look powerful card really think pricing bad vram also another thing amd favour number since yesterday 6800 suck outperforms 2080ti cheaper excuse 3070 even launched review started yesterday would put presentation 3070 equal worse 2080ti 2080ti still considerable vram much tensor core comparing 6800 2080ti choice also best one 3070 2080ti killer better roughly le half price 6800 550 performance double vram 3070 extremely competitive expecting going lower nvidia make sense match nvidia say trade blow 3080 think away matching price cheaper compared 3080 probably buy long available think stock nvidia probably match 30 series pricing legit said thing buddy lot people play wow number something relate hey getting 60fps give time upgrade getting 144fps 2060 1440p exactly demanding lol reason nvidia 3080ti around corner know vram equal speed right jury still gamers actually new card anything nvidia played lol amd produce chip new console bucket load bet chip supply much robust 100 going shitshow especially since many people going cancel nvidia order try one new one expecting stock situation better amd also wait 3rd party benchmark say rip nvidia 6800xt showed graph amd card rage mode smart access memory also many people considering likely cherry picked nature benchmark distinctly remember amd avoiding saying fatest unlikely confident zen3 almost said best talking 6900xt quite stuck saying fatest ever built competitive chart definitely showed win loss language used back showed 6800xt beating 3080 graph still said competitive still good chance lose overall average 3rd party benchmark consider 50 cheaper definitely slower rt dl competitior far seem much rip nvidia definitely rip 3090 card already doa price tag anyway also going power efficient vram kind expected think amd advantage since 7nm node proven point apparently nvidia trouble related 8nm node amd using tsmc tsmc let amd probably bah stupid reality getting way good dream hey amd cant ship proper amount product old tsmc node deserve hate nvidia get way launch mismanaged 3000 series much yes people seeing 6800 beating 2080ti 10 saying lol 3070 competitor smooth brain 6800 xt actually stock hopefully unlike 3080 otherwise yes agree worse buy need come price nvidia get shit together may actually stock overclock 3090 performance stock hopefully see point tbh mention know well ray tracing nvidia still dl still one best feature update seen year unless find 3080 software driver wise make 50 difference spade nvidia taking loyalty money granted amd actively trying earn money 50 price difference 200 mark conversion brainer equal performance give reason probably available scarce rtx 3080 6800xt better card sorry im clueless crypto mining isnt memory bandwidth low big navi assume cant use infinity cache mining doesnt care memory speed 50 performance

though 50 yes biased person nvidia sub amd sub probably rule 3 got discussion finally really pretty fair consider around 15 20 faster 2080ti course 3070 double amount vram way better performance 2080ti really say xt 20 cu higher clock cost 12 bit line yeah want buy 6800xt hard say see benchmark look argument going boil raw performance v dl rtx want look backwards 6800 non xt vram per know ton ppl problem 3080 manufacturer getting enough time test therefore card might hardware problem exactly 5700xt biggest headache ever pc sold someone wanted tinker bought 2070s looked back since love ryzen processor know able go amd card look level performance fair 6800 seems clear winner v 3070 16gb instead 8 question paying 70 dollar 6800xt double vram though performance wise true based chart yesterday review show 3070 virtually tied 2080ti amd claim 6800 18 better 2080ti game 3070 equal 6080 division 2 wolfenstein young blood 6800 could upto 15 faster tier 16gb vram performance wise way

quite frankly amd answer longer time go better dl get see play think healthy competition anyone thought second amd going come smash nvidia playing nvidia pushing boundary setting bar saw today hoped

additionally one usb c port displayport alternate mode good unknown amd super resolution quality performance spread even clear released want anything requires cuda core nvidia special software rtx voice broadcast shadowplay gsync gsync display also support amd freesync adaptive sync gpu egg tray setting 100 load 0 rpm fan speed well sold yeah cant let graph look bad tho even turned getting 10 15 lower perf 2 3rd price op overclock compare overclocked card stock one matter compare stock also completely blanked ray tracing performance surely would comparison hot workstation titan driver titan replacement marketing make people swallow price also expensive guessing benchmark arrive 6800 performance roughly faster extra cost want see uk pricing tho still trying forget explain rest still

999 card ray tracing please gimme break temporarily yep going better performance double vram depends wanna use raytracing benchmark right except leaked one proming 4k want dl function since powerful card yet see anything good pure 1080 1440 never use ray tracing could stretch decent price still pointless though since 70 clearly better card 6800xt one low end 3060 2060 450 euro think another 8gb vram come thin air cost nothing mad value double memory seems 15 20 infront 3070 rasterisation kill 3070 outright seems meaningful upgrade compared 80 premium think bad hell give month might case 6700xt direct 3070 competitor price come mainly vram push people buy xt honestly think people would buy whichever one hand waited two big navi going 3070 even wait dl 2 0 much killer feature 500 limit extra fps 6800 give fps trade rather keep game 120 fps 1440p instead 135 fps real disappointed lowest card ps5 seem great deal thank god nvidia went cheaper time amd would followed suit depends stock 80 month earlier access bad deal referring rx6800 one 70 le xt version rather closer 500 3070 6800 xt version telling ok amd card power consumption higher price slightly performance yet nvidia intel thing mocked talking 6800xt talking non xt variant may may new gpu architecture better performance watt ratio hope answer hope launch 3060 soon 500 patience alias name yea earlier expected 3060 either 6600 6700 varient 500 luck let see anything sleeve year 2 gave heart attack kidney humm thats one another way saw article 3060 unnamed radeon sku probably 6700 sure word official release wait even plugged yet lololol ooh baby know worth ooh heaven place earth rage mode overclock pin clock closer stock maximum still manual overclocking headroom well seems fine nvidia free build similar mode boost performance arent amd hardware based rt though linus stated new video every compute unit ray accelerator built sound hardware speaking care ray tracing 4k want ray traced want every pixel hdr want frame frame frame could find 3090 msrp would already bought one cyberpunk 2077 preordered year want crank everything max best experience possible honestly 6900xt 3080 pull rock solid 60fps 4k raytracing game buy one otherwise find 3090 benchmark come buying one yes really going common feature game going forward care relevant interest spending north 500 gpu enthusiast enthusiast early adopt care feature future proof amd definitely beaten nvidia big time price v performance likely eat market share big time supply said nvidia sat ass nothing come sick card even degree overpriced overall consumer win instance amd going force nvidia start aggressively pricing gouging shit everyone per usual really super awesome hear streaming driver support area hesitancy radeon graphic cleared find line launch grab 6800xt false newer amd card dedicated video encoding decoding pipeline supported pretty widely nowadays configure encoder use vce ob sharex etc granted nvec encoding produce visually clearer video w similar setting amd vce pipeline since 7900 series think record last min gameplay way stream vce code actually streamed amd gpu outright false information best course work ob codec installed gpu driver work system wide driver software know right sadly heard stability problem amd gpus hopefully fixed new card 1440p think 6800 actually pretty decent offering amd claim 18 higher performance 2080ti 1440p albeit smart access memory turned average meanwhile hardware unboxed tested 3080 21 faster 2080ti average 1440p think priced 6800 closer 6800xt think especially 1440p taking amd number optimistic maybe 10 15 ahead 2080ti offer mid point performance also dl probably worse raytracing heavy tradeoff mention 1440p card would fully shine 8gb going plenty next 2 3 year x200b bit dick move amd might actually swap 2070s becomes true otherwise planned skip gen heck yes 3080 cost 699 nvidia 3080 costly missing something good time gamer buy 3080 launch 3090 still dl well 3070 3080 even seen official third party benchmark said card could 10 15 better compared 2080 ti 3070 real world vram capacity think worth extra 15 20 price increase either play 1080p 1440p 6800xt tdp 20w le 3080 right 15 price reduction compared 3080 considering already done 32 35 price cut 3090 6900 xt would say 600 6800 xt far unrealistic know ray tracing performance personally vram capacity really matter since plan playing 1440p worth 80 even slight extra performance need lisa sue buy one one free twitter smack talk need depending cost yeah charge somewhere around 700 beyond stupid info already got leaked game dxr support work card performance number leak indicate going around 2080ti level rt performance great game use direct x ray tracing compatible everything xbox series x ps5 ray tracing capability amd hardware flagship level card native amd support macos pretty sure macos support intel integrated amd dedicated graphic amd gpus play much much nicer macos nvidia gpus last checked intel cpu still easier use amd though exactly true plenty amd gpus apple never actually used able used custom kexts probably thats bought xilinx chiplets expertise driver level thing gpu cpu exposed much raw bios gpu abstracted mention seems raja went found intel working imagine amd something mcm gpu lab churning away till figure want sell rest 5700 xt first might see 50 price drop soon yea planning build pc around thanksgiving time cuz black friday deal wanted next gen gpu guess seeing tomorrow nvidias website newegg furiously refreshing screen god forsaken hour yea likely tomorrow wont stock left 2021 plan waiting long gaming rig cheaper shrug buyer remorse cyberpunk 144fps line coke 3070 even yet expect drop price true also sure showed competes ray tracing enabled maybe missed though yeah smart memory thing worried want buy whole setup 10 3080 showed raytracing though anyone actually care generation going say lol might nvidia 2000 ray tracing smashed performance true raytracing cool adventure game especially 60 frame play raytracing 30 imo sigh open wallet ok dude http memorialmedical com service stroke service spot stroke fast exactly easy remember one might posted month ago find actual post boot think cyperpunk team saw feature better even dl smart access memory bit better based first party claim sure justifies extra cost 3070 consider feature dl probably better ray tracing performance amd underdog gpu market marketshare gained competitive product good pricing ok consumer nvidia dictate price every time without opposition yea make buying 6800 feel bad sure think stick targeting 3070 sadly trust amd number beat 3070 straight rendering dl see thing raytracing also leaf amd cheapest card 579 likely pretty bad price perf compared 6800xt probably 3080 yea probably market rocking r9 390 right hard patient 3070 220w really selling point 79 50 amd stellar chance back top manage produce enough card meet demand really hope launch flop said 3070 20 better 2080ti yeah quite 20 amd claimed 18 uplift v 2080ti 1440p smart access memory enabled still pretty decent margin maybe far 3080 6800xt may apple apple comparison blame got extremely lucky 3080 thought sure stock would fine least ok never know still better wait see amd offer p dont rub salt mean i7 6700k care lot raw power gpu without special feature requiring whole rebuild feature awesome though would push toward amd system exactly thought seeing price slide comparing 3080ntonthe 6800xt benchmark done without rage mode smart access direct head head rage mode one click way overclock really performance thing convinience unless missed something cpu best gaming cpu feature switch yeah great assumption worked dunno countering 3080ti super involve pricecut 6900xt yep aib oh yes nvidia produce tegra chip recently bought arm risc x86 cpu though intel make gpus though wait 12gb 24gb cause vram low vram 3080 prevents fully excelling productivity high re game compared 2080 vram 3090 nice 8k intense rendering large scene people need 8k 20gb render probably refering 350 dollar price difference 1080 ti 11gb ram think weird higher end 3080 le vram announcement thought high end card would 16 gb ram also gap 10gb 3080 24gb 3090 really big referring specifically memory game fps difference extra gb make big difference vr 4k 8k head head probably referring amount vram maye mean price perf definitely im still running intel i7 4xxx gtx 9xx gen im looking forward upgrade full red machine loooooong time since amd dominated market lisa great job since took ryzen 5000 ryzen 5 smart access memory radeon 6000s work ryzen 5000s need 5600x whatever 5000 series cpu gonna make work yea im confused people complaining price vram better performance dont see 6800 aiming 3070 target audience clearly sort middle ground card 3070 3080 maybe 3070ti apparently 3070ti got canceled cheaper 3080 launch 699 see disappointing nvidia would lower price 599 nobody would buy 6800xt unless amd force price thus hurting also 599 back 2016 around 649 today money keep mind r9 fury x released around 2015 649 inf 713 compare today money 16gb vram 4k60 ready smart memory access ray tracing etc 60 le say 6800xt pretty good price especially considering 3080 cost tl dr amd trying budget king want market leader highly competitive think 6800xt far better deal performance dollar ufd tech said there chance could 650 another channel came across said expecting 800 top one complaining 6900xt price saying huge undercut compared 3090 super resolution supposed kinda mention ohai hyperbolic shill 1 nope fancy bar graph gonna fly window dl 2 0 turned super resolution literally talked 2 one know bragging assume competitive depends super resolution finished talking raytracing finish scaling shooting foot true well mostly looking build 1440p 1080p high refresh rate build well 3070 suit better due price although wait lower end model hopefully announce release sooner rather later wait longer make first build case guess 3070 seems better option tbh dl 2 0 1 planning first build zen3 reveal decided go 3600 x xt thought take moment wait 6800 80 price tag performance although slightly better make sense lol planning 1440p 144hz build well mind playing 1080p 144 availability might factor let see country 1 1 5 time currency due import duty etc suck gotta suck hoping 6700 3060ti go easier pocket otherwise

next year people blind trend amd literally going except shitty bike lol generation generation agree nvidia smartest company tech right way theyd let slide throw many feature skus mix amd would drowned 10series v polaris vega amd yield decent price drop later nvidia drop price gonna feel amazing upgrading vega oh ya gonna snag one yes im happy able hand 3080 amazing tech happy finally competition high end fact choose one exciting also doubt company adjust price later performance per dollar likely increase larger 3080fe dl inferior ray tracing honestly 3080 look worth 50 premium much vram going

build hoping amd become thing sought destroy though yeah really paying attention gpu cpu announcement lol least someone bought 2080 ti though got 11 day left return probably keep 5700xt though rx6000 card launch driver issue supply issue might pick one sell 5700xt someone locally cheap ish least year pretty consistent lol really raytracing mean fuck big ship right dl nice amd adaptive resolution

devil card yet big navi headroom power nvidia time let wait see unless dl supported driver feature enabled across game big meh raytracing ampere disappointment excepted 2x better raytraced ipc game got 20 30 imma wait 4080 rdna 3 personally craving gpu totally would go massive nitro sapphire 6900xt personally play game ray tracing true however guarantee much better nvidia ray tracing yet amd announced version dl well see anything unfortunate someone leaning towards 3080 want 6800xt surprise underestimate big deal gamers make 50 dollar price difference 6800xt 6900xt gap around 10 xbox support basically every game already showed older one agree 3080 pricing either availability remains seen 6800 series also sorry 2020 2010 mindshare change much rapidly average consumer becomes prosumer people want value money industry dominated single player 2 decade want evidence shift towards value brand loyalty look ryzen rapid ryze sorry consumer segment performance claim even remotely close amd reap profit price point consumer loses market forthemostpart single metric performance leader guy second place discount option essentially promise feature thus competitor dl right super

nvidia broadcast etc etc stuff amd answer also course cuda vastly superior opencl anyone would want something heavy video editing top card 6900xt 3090 would view nvidia option far favorably care rasterization yeah huge win top card overpriced anyway really see 3080 v 6800 xt win though one 50 cheaper sure new 5000 series cpu smart cache enabled across x570 board agree double vram missed obviously cost amd simply must confident leader budget market since trying budget option anymore linus even released video yesterday showing 2080ti within 2 average 3070 rtx 3080 better 2080ti across board gamers last 2 3 release already improved massively stability bug experience eagerly awaiting day tech jesus go live big navi review already gotten 3080 still excites nvidia need competitor stop damn pompous back amd direct competition nvidia actually good pricing competition year could cause arm race sorely needed correct prior referred ray tracing rtx corrected come better rtx 3070 yeah caviats one ray tracing performance supposed better ampere also conveniently mentioned real dl competitor dl really big one give ability fps without much lose quality maybe dl performance equal price difference 6800xt also better option really point getting 6800 yeah new feature implying thanks insight neither nvidia also partner probably pny 6700xt different die navi22 amd severely wafer constrained right making navi21s worry zen good making many hope soon mean buy 3070 8gb 500 msrp 2060s claim ps5 36cus albeit rather high clock leaked 6800xt port royale score slightly rtx 2080ti 6800xt exactly twice much cu ps5 lower clock kinda believe df case yeah close nvenc come live encoding low bitrates example amd vce encoder called look similar x264 veryfast superfast really ugly lower bitrates since nvidia turing lineup made nvenc chip better par x264 medium x264 medium huge load come cpu encoding 80 usage ryzen 7 3700x 1080p 60fps encoding yeah people stream need rtx raytracing go radeon gpu turing gpu came really wanted buy amd gpu nvidia came around corner hello motherf cker meme brought rtx broadcast better nvenc etc hell nah amd gpu true first time amd looked super promising smoke water yeah sell 1200 1500 due people desperation basically fund getting 6900xt new asus dark hero mobo oof true wild run 5600xt zero issue better list example game issue ofc none game work really bad damn gotta wonder shitty new gpus game mate convinced research group use funding u 4 3090s need look power requirement etc might end getting 2 3 max given lack stock hah reason regret small bump game playable 6800xt series easily playable 3080 real difference might end raytracing play game texture set insane setting need jumbo 4k monitor pause game see difference yeah nobody going buy 6800 machine learning opencl ecosystem happen barely made dent nvidia market apple abandoned spite guess yeah know said back ray tracing would supported nvidia card launch implying amd support would come later 579 649 wtf spacing 80 3070 performance almost 20 expensive agreed 70 le 6800xt seem great talking xt seems pretty nice value obligatory fuck miner statement aware said passing mention worrying point time anything concrete show buying hardware future promise smart strategy dude switch vega 64 due driver issue 2070s looked back yes benchmark rtx 3070 already slower rtx 2080 ti slightly put 6800 non xt 20 faster double vram double ram huge dl come dl competitor soon mention working new super sampling technology huge win amd otherwise 3070 might best choice 4k gaming vec default anything entirety working hardware kink 5000 series gcn still encode decode flawlessly besides clearly short showcasing gamers starter dl feature point many u speak word heat noise either super short presentation totally devoid technical detail yeah waiting reviewer benchmark end u planning staying zen 2 next 2 year 6900xt fall short 3090 likelihood much though great perf understand feel ignores fact nvidia bottom card cheaper really trying save would want 3070 better encoder feature anyway maybe bet nvidia continued poor stock know performance wise much room decrease 6700 xt ok vram end made percentage difference performance 2080 ti figure left 6800 slide 3070 performs better title 2080ti finally 6800 slide state figure smart access memory wait real benchmark yeah seems bad deal want cheapest new gpu 3070 play add extra 80 better 6800xt rage mode actually oc gamers nexus released video straight release effectively power slider pushed max definitely think 3090 better think 500 better console gamer well probably care lot dl rtx put extra money spent ps5 gpu choice 3090 came yesterday sure enough time amd include presentation though plus would going reveiwers

bummer still neat yeah 100 cheaper wanted really disrupt thing 6800 price 3080 order big cancelled probably stick yes wait see good rtx 30 series 3080 order via amazon think cancelled though think still try 3080 every day 6800 xt come ah think keep 3080 50 price difference yes sorry 6800 6800 better performance suck bought new ultrawide around may experience amd card gsync monitor would open giving gsync performance difference worth implemented rdna2 dl competitor coming soon description info 6900xt available board partner 18 slower wdym similar performance also 6800 16gb memory unlike

switching nvidia amd gpu would mean reinstalling window avoid glitch serious dealbreaker btw realize next gen console rdna2 announced ray tracing 4k 60fps part platform put damper hype console 4k60 rt time rt title likely 1440p30 say 5700xt work fine linux crash randomly time window say driver issue exactly linked fact bad window going return made full switch linux anyway lmao rushed mofo crazy hit issue testing pretty sure would mentioned rt way number ray tracing game support need 16gb vram card yes game going using especially cyberpunk agree posting comment also forgot rtx 3090 vram benefit artist prosumers would require case 6900xt 30 weaker 3090 fps per dollar wise ha yeah shit scare hardware software 970 one thing pascal turing gen kerfuffle note rage mode smart access enabled bummer need zen 3 3080 wanted 800 6900 999 people losing mind nivdias ray tracing completely hardware based along dl amd going software addon usually never performance hardware dedicated task still probably 3080 reason ever find one stock advantage amd would card available nvidia get shit together buy 6900xt paired wirh 5950x every time tried use enhanced sync 60hz freesync gsync vrr screen ton stutter acer x34p ultrawide think gsync modle chance ati card thing xbox 11 10 ps5 11 12 6800 6800xt 11 18 6900xt 12 8 thats sam tho personally zen2 upgrading least ddr5 zen4 people help wondering whether sam something hardware level think implement zen2 whether software level dick 15 performance apparently 500 series board 5000 series cpu use smart access memory knock 11 6800 result otherwise oh right thanks mentioning 3070 came ahead rt right memory data volume would probably able check ahead last point nice yes thought vram quite point especially 6800 v 3070 rt benchmark probably 3070 1440p rt amd literally everything else im really curious mid class next year interesting see 6600 xt 3060 think last bit sold good point though man benchmark run condition rt dl nvidia amd card im fence newest ryzen combo older graphic card vice versa helping friend want keep budget around 1000 an good point though read see important sam reiterate sam work newer generation amd part anyhow friend building us davinci resolve lot heard program preference cuda core know much improvement see using nvidia amd go nvidia 3070 2060 make buying new ryzen 5 kind pointless right reason go full amd sam sma better gaming stuff video editing motherboard would pair amd cpu gpu dont teach u school dammit panic sell amd dunno one company bought x86 ip via chinease company big braining u likely hat price power difference nvidia 30 series new amd gpu work amd favor especially global market many people broke looking saving wherever mean one buy either 3070 seems much better value le might well spend bit 6800xt 3080 going available msrp anyway yeah care dl raytracing performance yet cyberpunk play game potato setting free alternative rtx voice buy video card feature lmao rtx dl much older fidelityfx tech boasted announcement shafted anyway think amd released pricing processor well forgot vat price 600 correct friend grabbed 3080 fe 650 asus tuf 3080 720 ocuk generally expensive higher vram though miss feature gddr6 instead gddr6x people skeptic dl see performant use example want play cyberpunk dl worth considering take 50fps 70fps desired resolution plan playing dl compatible game already framerate want game play without would feeding fomo thinking must dl look objectively take want best lens good reason dl bust mentality go nvidia website look list future dl game conclusion play game

equivalent remote streaming software good steam close running steam use eh zen type b hurt real number come intel joke zero credibility also present someone integrity product speak quite consumer actually literally mentioned passing actually something good hand performance wise trumpeted rooftop instead oh support dx12ult andswiftlymovingon bench mind well vaporware announced supported nothing moment compare 6000 series performs enabled idea good bad perf given literally zero said perf official pre recorded presentation assume perf shit working well given state software stack holding breath ban troll watch presentation regarding ray tracing think job time really want beat go equal nvidia driver board launch wrong point issue amd driver took way long fix issue returned 5700xt 8 month trying everything nvidia fix day latest release hope amd get right minimal issue quick fix need want 6800xt yea kind wondering encoder stuff slightly disappointed none lol yeah supply problem huge side nvidia let retailer raise price way msrp know supply amd maybe also 3 card everyone rtx dl gimmick chance dude literally future completely wrong think rtx dl future tech see many game every body need fore sure could live 2080ti rtx performance solid dl alternative smart memory thing bit problem want upgrade cpu full advantage 6800xt fuck yeah mean aib 3090s barely gain performance even 450w due bad 8nm scale 7nm hand fr day decent performing pc around 1k slowly disappearing yeah going red may winner forget console port may favor amd especially xbox game pas title bethesda owned microsoft mentioned dl equivalent tbh still considering 10gb variant well could one yeah cum pant though nice see competition term raw performance radeon since hd5870 day maybe hoping slam dunk term pricing zen 2 release curious performs ray tracing compared 3080 want see benchmarts wtih rt v 3080 rt benchmark personally well yeah kinda also likely worse driver funny 7 nvidia could 7 card stock yea figure definitely looked much bigger margin 2080ti 3070 show showed 2080 3070 beat wording wrong mean low end card yeah question rather claim based really catching showing 6800 2080 however one thing never denied novice pretty new building really well hmm exactly make sense lower 3070 price lower price trend match 6800xt 6900xt card lol heard pulling intel calling 3070 ee instead emergency edition one exciting announcement ever looking amd beating nvidia something never thought got thanks believe miss something mean phased oh realize exclusive blue please u prefer capacitor color well would color actually increased performance let go red good feeling giving 15 fps card fill lineup coming sure 470 still serviceable card full lineup drop yeah card still standing foot really well wait sure little bit thank rx480 5700xt pulse pretty jarring nice see yes rx5700xt true beast money per performance 400 450is hmmm thats crazy value worth wait end think wait thanks answer bro long wait 2021 announcing card th thanks answer choice 1080p 1440p problem concerned performance 400 budget sure wait know actually worth wait new architecture bring big price performance performance per watt impro thats good info thank mean cost 5700xt thank answer buddy ct amd next next gen card look could well pull thing intel nvidia anyone guess sure 5700xt would serve well 2 year 7000 series card want great

great think win consumer still iffy terrible driver track record fork grand think mean two maybe least 6800 guess depends close performance xt talking 6900xt gonna guess already probably losing money higher tier card maybe hence higher price popular cheaper 6800 ya even put professional driver lay bed make nvidia marketed gaming gpu compared gaming gpus lol cuda tesnsor core great many professional apps cuda though lot professional application make difference otherwise yeah gaming card priced titan none feature show card said 3090 semi professional card casual gamer going buy

even much 1440p gaming title highest setting also enough 4k 16gb 6800 make absolutely difference make difference next 3 4 year make 6800 pointless leaving 500 segment nvidia meanwhile nvidia prepping emergency 3070ti probably compete 6800 price range think missed pricing nvidia already rushing respond wait 5600xt instead 3700x faster game question many really need 4k want 3070 6800 competing 4k probably high priority 6800xt even better closer come price 3070 meanwhile rtx closer come performance dude game play even dx 11 hell would developer besides maybe valve implement ray tracing really asking much black ops cold war watch dog legion cyberpunk ray tracing biggest game launching year halo infinite next year pc also using ray tracing among u really benefit ray tracing feel bruh put ray tracing spyro awesome haha kinda want try shame already ps4 currently replaying new vega rn also heard ray tracing available assume mod worth hows compare lighting mod fallout realistic lighting edit dumb totally missed misread comment game ray tracing capability still getting morning coffee lol oh yeah among u ray tracking ur smart one bud ray tracing going matter soon console yea thats really argument homie fact nvidia technology amd doesnt havent shared anything caring technology doesnt make le true lot people care game use technology teasing benchmark teased new feature vega never realized tbh hoping cancel 3080 nvidia nothing short cluster fuck didnt catch x570 mobo valid one imo amount money getting vram 10gb definitively enough 4k gaming still feel getting much spending guess idea push everyone need lot vram towards buying 3090 3080 something 16gb would make 3090 le appealing considering 24gb vram one main selling point definitely believe managed one today fe one wanted heard bit loud care much noise since play headphone happy enjoy plus dl true ray tracing benchmark ignored said amd making next gen console support ray tracing sure ray tracing good enough amd

case one probably bottleneck 1080p 20 30fps 1440p higher fine thanks quick reply yeah looking 6800 xt damn close result sorry hear expect one happy bday holiday encoding make video quality better better encoding better quality go nvidia youtube channel see doom eternal gameplay recorded rtx 3080 pretty good nvidia said site rtx 3080 used youtubers recording quality want know 6800xt feature missing nvidia shadowplay reflex well streaming fix already one 6k seies improvement around 13 faster vram kinda useless card though since mostly aimed 1440p 144hz also lose ray tracing think 530 would reasonable think know pricing problem power one suspicion got large stock 5700xt want sell releasing something price tag based rdna2 serious people first look price see 579 price tag skip pricewize 80 buck similar performance kinda 80 though expensive offering 2080ti level performance rationalise higher price however want ultimately matter much aiming buy 3070 two reason amd b break 500 barrier rtx 3070 buyer already price conscious 6800 offer much except higher price guess amd want present budget gpu maker previous performance gpu maker speaks otherwise people bite instead wait 3070 becomes available yes direct competitor considering pricing perfomance slightly could gonna sandwich 3070 instead pushing direct competitor competitive 6700 xt release later based chip deliver yet see probably next year seen dl rt benchmark must reason shown got haha 3080 slightly msrp country available card msi palit asus card way way msrp seriously hoping amd stock available interested good encoder streaming rt performance dl perfectly fine look good yeah raw performance better many game coming rt want experience played control full rt dl good preference talking msrp 700 asus tuf awesome aib card exactly dl rtx playing 1440p 3070 beat 6800 significantly le much better software feature much better driver rdna 1 definitely stock time 6800xt release sure stock le two week think nvidia would possibly let gamers choice buy 6800xt dl rtx performance gimmick lmao wanna know show ray tracing performance get stomped 3080 ray tracing sure gimmick probably remain one forseable future dl moving away gimmick becoming actually useful feature actually give fps dl gimmick literally double framerate improves image quality happens turn ray tracing 1440p compare 3080 much better native ray tracing dl ray tracing definitely amd would released ray tracing number plus look benchmark release overclocked card ryzen 5000 series cpu overclock 3080 put cpu better mhw used dl 1 0 trash lot upcoming aaa game utilizing dl 2 0 raytracing understand rude voicing legitimate concern amd likely take crown availability raw memory size 50 rtx 3080 pretty much guaranteed give better

availability implying 80 appeal amd lowering price nvidia look love cpu ill pay 50 driver support dl rtx voice know compare rt 3070 likely close gap quite bit match perhaps even outperform amd dl alternative yet performance gap smaller practice figure new smart access memory tech people price close xt great price reason cough bit buy ya real detail timeline amd anywhere close finished surely

smashed complacency choice seriously improve upon pricing behavior relation customer might hold 1080 wait till rnda 3 come year well good hear interesting think pc gamers sick nvidia enough competition would amazing year two amd gpu superior matching nvidia almost every way rzyen would really push nvidia complacency current behavior pricing going take ampere might still bit better gen time thats amd pushed console game coming utilize rt dl yeah man gimmick people say likely 3000 series card somebody never used dl rt pretty much every new aaa going ray tracing familiar driver development either afaik linux driver opposite aka better nvidia open source maybe could probably reason window driver play old game emulator mainly used emulator believe fun dl thank idk aware nvidia rtx 3090 24gb signed ah got time ti come wont hyped anymore lol thank el risitas need next pulse 5700xt never issue got lucky conspiracy obvious nvidia matching amd performance brute force also considering price drop compared 20xx pricing apparently card one ray accelerator core per cu dedicated rt core seems yeah think perform level nvidia ampere rt mixed bag better 3080 gaming mostly 10fps give ability video rendering content work would crash 3080 bc insufficient vram 6800xt vram better 4k gaming think actually cheaper unless rtx dl really matter kinda depends use lot application run cuda personally find good free photogrammetry software support amd use cuda exclusively also thing faceapp pain run amd game believe amd look depends game 3d rendering assume similar amd denoising get implemented maybe amd carrs little better since vram nah appears basically case better case little worse overall better value im afraid amd driver bad 0 1 low ruin vr also dl also big problem since believe dl huge game changer game importantly high re vr little bit actually fiance lot 3d rendering bit enthusiast mention driver tend perform better 3090 allow game way higher resolution particularly 4k fiance use added horsepower rendering 3090 benchmark vr make card running index reverb g2 pre ordered bought mine amazon think might try 5000 series yes launched tool 1 day ago lot fast coding logo coming soon need create database thanks using free tool patient please comment sent programmer speed issue much people sub hate admit console define tech get used hairworks phys x etc never became mainstream stayed niche option game agreed console ensure mainstream ray tracing rtx support doesnt matter use directx 12 feature dont software support ray tracing whether raw performance card handle technology nvidia us dl proprietary nvidia mean manufacture going add secondary system understanding use ai go thought game enhance scene ai enhance meant used game case simple slapping software saying good go ray tracing fact didnt really mention show clear comparison make think arent quite yet rt performance seeing first attempt fair doesnt dl ray tracing support doesnt mean reach nvidias rtx card performance nvidia second attempt rtx dl combo absolutely widen gap nvidia amd card game support new amd card great ray tracing think made bigger deal show version dl doubt either good nvidias branding two company taken different approach solving problem nvidia gen ahead second attempt happy proven wrong quite surprised 6800xt came close 3080 ray tracing turned would show presentation yeah agree vram definitely positive amd becomes issue 4k rather 1440p amd card seem shine sure many game make vram interesting see card age time versus nvidia one given different approach think least bench difference 10 look sub 10 everything else spot definitely better card comparing rrp launch paper price 6800xt 3080 price aib card retailer marked due demand quite fair comparison imo 3080 cost 700 think 6800xt cost 649 seeing thats company tend u gb conversion day pick 3080 60 uk get raytracing dl thought remembered saying 18 inc 2080ti 3070 depends title suppose wait real world benchmark impression got comfortable 4k60fps performer either 3070 2080ti dl quite something imagine 3 year could turn dl max detail isnt possible anymore play another 3 max detail magic wand harry potter one beat p 5800 twice ram 3070 5800 xt 60 ram 3080 likely preform similar level extra ram going give card longer life becoming obsolete newer game mean better gpu care feature yeah massive feature unfortunately missing amd render 1440p upscale look good within margin error native 4k faster 6900xt almost several big title end year already developer include dl support much easier sitting optimising getting free juice otherwise really hunt especially consider big title actually need high performance gpus produced team include flat solid business development decision dog legion ac valhalla cod cold war cyberpunk 2077 end year major game would actually need graphical horsepower game include rt dl also demanding one hand big chunk demanding game include feature yea thats definitely true plan putting lot time one support dl rtx gaming time limited nowadays picky looking play support latest tech buying based dl rtx definitely gamble imo 6800 make much sense 1440p 4k gaming better choice cover slightly better non rt dl performance fair 10 15 seen slightly gonna faster ray tracing though way thats focus nvidia ahead regard especially dl feel people playing anything 4k performance close really feature appreciate u folk gotta remember graph 130 fps v 140fps thats fine either way guy lol everything including going gpu wise 3070 doubt 1440p 4k sure believe 3090 8k 60 using dl upscale rendering 6900xt competing ability yet probably think gonna big clock speed jump go 350w spoke dx9 mention tho anyone buying gpus old hardware right yeaahh work anywhere near well upscale 720p 4k look amazing etc cpu gpu thing rad tho an well priced glad competition back r agedlikemilk big oof thanks guess expecting say end make big deal noice gotcha kinda hard tell presentation meant way around enabling increase performance cpu task gpu fully loaded yeah actually agree 100 percent cancelled thank god stock issue even amd stock issue might much lower tier 3080 got caught hype yep usually take u price add 20 tax maybe 5 import etc true wonder good feature spoke tho remember name since cpu first wonder stock issue mention much boost yeah think right might leave cpu upgrade see running 100 percent bottlenecking next gen game moment never seen 60 percent cpu cheaper 5800xt v 5900xt really much upgrade 72 v 80 much thanks 4k result dl would show higher 3090 frame rate seen actual performance gain 3 combo already zen 3 processor would make sence upgrade motherboard b550 x570 oh ok thx info used scan considering keep amazon mind never really bought pc part odd reason gather game bundle one release haha understood think stick known commit 300 keep climbing thought samething going wait sapphire version 6900xt told 6900xt reference card aib build hope wrong sapphire card may ask i9 tdp differs generation model im excited also long sell pur 3900x right 5900x big loss maybe 100 atleast thats im looking price performance thing high end pay premium best best always way initial driver release etc etc raw performance card without fancy ram pretty impressive fine wine likely apply rdna2 mean ship lower grade memory nvidia also lower tdp suspect clocking driver improvement make difference also monitor actually support hdr pay as hdr1000 capable monitor cpu causatory relationship inverted though cpu work 1080p gpu le work thus bottleneck cpu since gpu lot overhead 4k gpu ton work thus serf bottleneck performance cpu amount work fps gpu bottleneck performance lower fps would gotten 1080p pessimistic thing people buy crazy nvidia outsells amd huge margin think bench mark come sell never tried buy graphic card day one really sure behave chance one also europe maybe time zone disadvantage compared u mean idk hour card become avaiable anyway thanks pointing evga know step program trying understand avaiable shipping europe well already sold joke also looking something powerful maybe live u lol eh guess probably mean launch day prayer lmao beennwondering actually 3900x better 3950x extra core give advantage gaming v 3900x mean say popular time dl definitely help hurr durr 12 people raytracing look upcoming aaa game many feature ray tracing since console expect many game dismiss unless buy card play current game entirely depends game honestly poorly implemented easily missable everything control deliver u moon extent doom nothing else even tried utilize far traditional gaming definitely giving nvidia run money wait see compare next gen game guy utilizing rtx read comment thread lol first one see someone upset nvidia ray tracing another 6gb vram though feel keep getting overlooked last amd card driver issue last 8months p man kid window shopping non existent money information basing thing heard friend internet amd driver stuff pretty sure case friend nvidia driver better sailboat yes ik cant actual benchmark people actually hand card cant hurt look around expectation hwbench com vgas radeon rx 6900 xt v geforce rtx 3080 obviously gonna make decision benchmark released one example show slower even 3080 ill prolly wait see benchmark cuz dont money upgrade gpu cpu wanna know itll still better 3080 without using sam rage mode since lacking ddr6x le shaders anyone know embargo lift 3rd party benchmark review review going change pricetag featureset hope jebaiting 6800 drop 499 know dl enabled nvidia wait benchmark ml application yeah seriously almost matter order play game hate gaming community much historically speaking amd ati pretty awful driver issue pretty well documented although nvidia issue wel really rtx 3090 competitor 16gb v 24gb wonky either way much higher bandwidth normal gddr6 steve gn already debunked rt already shown supported title benchmark probably later support rt nowhere shit slow 2000 series launched well match igorslab benchmark said benchmark showed marked decrease rt performance mean ml solution plenty talking dl equivalent thought obvious rtx voice meh

hardware issue reason asus added power metering gizmo 3000 series card amd gpu driver issue since 8 year ago hear people come bitch yeah bullshit amd legendary driver issue said elsewhere even hardware unboxed done whole segment likely reason persists amd worth better card especially spending hundred dollar possibly 1000 30 premium 10 gain rt hardware dl nvenc good luck 3080 dl going wreck even 6900xt worse ray tracing performance current ml solution worse video encoder performance nothing mentioned presentation v nvenc rtx voice famous roll dice amd driver raytracing thing really yes

2080ti outlier people foolishly think wanted scrape everyone worth rather cover development cost rt core tensor core ai tech make dl possible insanely expensive first cost money slowly adapting amd done 20xx priced high wether trying first good strategy subject different debate sorry yes could clearer still worth bearing mind figure best could mean anything really wouldnt first time amd represented performance benchmark number curious see run intel regardless th price difference 3090 make sense sell intel system build amd system match 6900xt wait review assuming anything price difference big comparing overclocked card stock one fill confidence gonna need see proper figure first still compare 2080 ti might faster double vram also cost look much better compared 1200 card nvidia intended market faster compare 2080 ti either card similar performance 3070 think expensive danger id bet money 3080ti 6900xt 100 huge deal since remember nvidia dl superior ray tracing solution hell 3080 dl beat 6900xt benchmark watch watch dog legion ac valhalla cod cold war cyberpunk 2077 come bet base 3080 beat dl amd even fucking launched lmao care launch pointless argument lmao many hour playing control think title play regularly dl support would know think otherwise say big improvement literally called magic lol honestly thought fancy 4k 8k scaling feature core tech everyone buying nvidia card specifically bit taken comment saying eh dl pay extra xxx nvidia card time position ever experience even good impression 4k screen even watch youtube video youtube compression withstanding sure follow point creating artificial scarcity complicated requires warehouse questionable strategy see competition look try flood market people chance even consider option think retro suggesting ramping production possible s warehouse full gtx3080 exists nice point metric give shit fucking actually buy one nvidia fanboys skeptical big navi would double die size navi 10 skeptical would beat 3080 performance let alone come close 3090 know die size navi 21 260 transistor count nav 10 95 transistor count 3090 factor percentage disabled die space nvidia gpu even 3090 amd

time around price point seems accurate level performance compared nvidia card claiming compete bro money buying super high end shit amd nvidia would also favor 6900xt haha funny sex number card anyone bought 3090 gaming already idiot money matter bought 3090 compute still ahead 24gb gddr6x big deal v 16gb gddr6 apple fanboys exactly got 3090 launch pumped amd competing end many short minded people 3090 buyer raging um waste much money hobby better believe every year amd nvidia forced push every year make massive leap gaming year double whammy almost case canceled aibs pissed canceled already probably rush super gen q2 2021 upgrade 1700x shoe homie x570 mobo pcie 4 0 essentially useless nice x470 even grabbing r5 3600 would probably substantial increase preformance mean running cause issue outside game strictly single threaded well consider upgrade one basically going upgrade say monster hunter implementation hot garbage though literally one know run literally worse upscaling ri turned let honest ray tracing still little make game look significantly better perhaps exception minecraft rtx game even support rtx barely tell noticeable blown away difference visuals anything notice hit fps notice increased graphical fidelity anecdotal glad people able appreciate difference enjoy said personally upset amd ray tracing abysmal since barely even take advantage rtx let alone dl would love able use know single game play planning buying even implementing dl 2 0 still graphical wizardry dl huge dl mean game use memory time save memory rendering lower resolution upscaling allow 3080 10gb remain relevant 4k much longer right amd hand decided brute force solution pairing card whopping 16gb knocking method awesome memory cost money mean amd earns le per sale guess missed part trying

open source academic tweak code driver code etc etc bet 450 nice little undercut card performs slightly worse 3070 way 5700xt compare 2070s cpu gpu wondering 70 500 product different tier performance 5 10 faster 3070 definitely worth price though considering 6800xt way faster 70 efficiency need argument dropped amd well obviously mate made comment context dude saying would doa compared 3070 really make sense imo yeah yt channel 6 8k red camera sitting around sure amd could afford something similar yea firmi pushed new level bit lower look go higher 300w seemed damn high generation ago right 350w getting deemed normal 40 year ago gpu could feed 100w cpu issue heard guess going experiencing anything mean much one person yea think remember 6900 benchmark totally saying cause 400 new gpu however hope actually compete time instead slotting price bracket really hoping good stuff 2 300 market aswell couple month nvidia basically abandoned entry level gpu market term cost remeber 1060 250 amd brings genuine gaming oriented gpu 300 new competitor mean let honest everyone earns money could purchase rtx 3090 6900xt incredible waste money 50 higher price 10 performance uplift ridiculous price perf big deal 15 better also cost 15 scale perfectly willing bet otherwise slotted right middle pricing side note gpus come bundled game would solid selling factor 3070 currently come nothing 6800 come far cry 6 willing justify extra cost nvidia upscaling probably better mean extra vram well worth extra mention overall performance benefit actually near amd say look 6800 marketed card multiplayer game 6800xt 6900xt specifically 4k gaming correct wrong ray tracing performance 6800 really matter since multiplayer title fps generally important great graphic buy one 10 60 pc game enjoy ray tracing caveat keep mind better raytracing amd encoder making pretty solid generation jump well reason think also improved big navi backing underdog encourage competition yea gonna go 3070 unless availability horrible really new gpu year end might end going 6800 6800xt make sense hope stock nvidia amd good christmas lol budget build looking 580 graphic card 580 solidly high end pc range already make sense spend another 70 6800xt 4k60 exists specially tv perfect 4k60 1440p high framerate want 1440p high framerate maybe 3070 better 4k gaming 6800 better 8gb imo low even 1440p know much need year amd version dl awhile amd version dl talking image sharpening thing nitro product fantastic medium priced compared generally expensive within amd ah ok thank explaining 2020 keep getting weirder weirder think justification 17 percent average lead 4k 3070 even 10 percent still healthy lead literally need 5000 series cpu 500 series motherboard 6800 result showed used smart access memory anyone without see much lower performance 6800 think justification 17 percent average lead 4k 3070 even 10 percent still healthy lead 14 higher price expect 17 boost rasterisation give dl raytracing supposedly lot worse rdna driver reliable amd card additionally one usb c port displayport alternate mode need use buy adapter first cheapest adapter find support dp 2 0 cost 25 many case 1 4 adapter ok one also cost 15 gsync display also support amd freesync adaptive sync nearly none actual gsync display gsync compatible freesync monitor called gsync compatible actual gsync monitor gsync module support gpus adaptive sync even support 144hz gpus 100 85hz exception though beginning last november nvidia started ship gsync module updated firmware support adaptive sync gsync adaptive sync hdmi update older monitor even buy new monitor today might one old firmware depending produced many old chip display manufacture still want know new gsync module work amd gpus may connect gpu using hdmi show gsync compatible monitor support adaptive sync everybody bought gsync module 1 year ago definitely freesync even bought yesterday might still luck game play easy v scrambled medium feel important missing pizza chart post even 10 15 lower rage mode sam added 2 8 except single game added 13 around 5 6 change expect said see amd would test thing exclusive sam feature tad wierd across board use rage mode basically increase power limit card according gamersnexus amd officially stated improvement rage mode benchmark 1 2 much worse normal aib lead reference design yeah think radeon anywhere near rtx rt perf probably 20 series level although sure actually able benchmark expensive 16gb vram v 8gb 3070 80 buck pretty good double vram expensive hand better product make sense least later one able remove album yes marketing stunt history book force feeding music album never done year ago apple basically forced new u2 album onto idevices could remove marketing b many people extremely upset http imore com apple let itunes user delete free u2 album music library purchase currently i5 6600k new build ryzen 7 5800x assuming sell 5700xt running hot noisy taste slapped morpheus game 1080p 240hz usually pubg world tank cap fps decent graphic setting neither always room beside much home time smart shift smart access memory different feature think reviewing biggest thing need 5 series chipset aside bet let zen2 function eventually 1080p 1440p gamer make much difference tbh still rather go 3070 due budget constraint 4k definitely show much better 3070 double vram joke expecting legit 3070 competitor go blow blow ala happen half tier higher 3060 still mid range low end better known entry level something 1660 super card always around 350 dollar maybe honestly doubt extra vram worth extra cost feature likely bottleneck vram application 10gb vram price performance believe much better value tbf think 3070 supposed dedicated 4k card maybe 1440p med graphic 4k really curious dl even field since provides pretty significant performance also 80 dollar quite lot people given lot new game ray tracing cyberpunk 2077 call duty basically cripple performance card something rt core 3070 benchmark 35 better 5700xt remember correctly good point seen 30 series card close msrp au 3080 stock turkey quite time release though even cheapest model significantly 25 expensive announced price likely possible launch without dealing scalper even miss card amazon de oh yeah right make sense talking performance vram cut half huge lot newer title demanding 8gb ram happens 3070 see large dip performance due allocate data rest system meanwhile 6800 cruising along 16gb able meet demand future game today game answer question yes ok oops right yeah 6800 kinda meh given recent trend 6600 6500 5700xt year two though 6900xt essentially 9600 midrange long another 50 performance boost generation year decent midrange card honestly know yet overclock headroom may much current result since tgp 300w overclock doubt increased power limit 3090 either comparison potentially extra little boost somehow doubt amd showed oc 3090 however exactly apple apple also dedicated lol convinced wanting ray traced honestly nvidia idiot probably gone 3080 may still depending thing go 6800xt release 3090 considering yeah nvidia kinda reminds intel regard seem set price want competition suddenly shit something come along see last year 5700xt 2070 super card price cut hopefully amd good stock level mining day card sold double thing leaning towards amd also support linux operating system helpful come updating driver stability one hand company least trying help linux window user whereas nvidia focused window also outperforms 2080ti rasterisation pretty significant margin amd claimed 18 better 1440p smart access memory enabled splitting difference 3070 3080 true interesting see super resolution upscaling competitive dl though properly unveiled shh let amd card u good luck finding one nvidia effectively threw towel fe already even restocked age realistically getting aib card starting 750 sure find one lol closer 800 900 nvidia 699 6 dl better driver ray tracing brainer sorry point saying 6900xt everything 6700 6900xt mostly play 1080p card catered rumor 6800 xt 2080 ti ray tracing find unsettling show ray tracing performance disagreeing arent little guy le 3080 order return window probably outside 6800 xt launch ffs first world problem rdna2 ray tracing version dl coming thanks playing yup high end hackintosh build awesome value compared apple offering still running vii vega sweet thanks info xilinx deal fascinating yeah combine amd chiplet tech new direction xilinx goin 5g start see xilinx combining fpgas asics amd would perfect integration partner gpus cpu supercomputing xilinx see xilinx supporting memory controller io infinity fabric super computer intra chip networking say 4 epic chip daughter board connect together amd likewise new customer new

go bestbuy fe card price benchmark 6800 3070 seem way close nvidia accept announced working dl competition without dl 4k raytracing really viable want 60fps without major graphical downgrade place raytracing though anyone actually care generation kinda dumb question read sean connery voice yes lead progammer wait moment watch premiered stream see amd feature light knowing bit time advance probably decided delay implement feature sure take time take decision delay game probably got know feature week advance decided assuming anyway didnt listen whole presentation understanding amd coming alternative dl better basically every game except 4 dlss2 0 maybe real life pricing isnt solely dictated competitor know maybe rumored 3070 ti honestly thing holding back availability matter price stock said le match 3070 true peform better 3070 going amd graph max gain saw 13 rage mode overclocking everyone maybe 7 slower without sam still 999 compared 1500 3090 pretty insane one click overclock already exist fact memory oc undervolt oc current driver one click automatically guess improvement really overclock end likely vary card card amd ryzen 5000 series 5900x best gaming chip 5950x enthusiast chip people load money 5600x 5800x budget chip still pretty strong mostly better intel yeah wrote wrong meant 3070 thank ya bit explanation reply seems context recently unless counting lol intel graphic past even yet release graphic card ton gpus 10 20gb respectively far gaming benchmark difference apparently marginal seems 3090 beneficial rendering rather pure gaming card still lot cheaper enterprise card suppose 10 24 right talking performance think even read comment difference even bigger though 3080 10 gb 3090 24 gb oh yeah vram 10 24 bad thought talking general performance edit video also btw apparently upcoming sku 20gb 3080 actually 10 v 24 person replying talking performance metric think speed case amount vram big gap strictly speaking though 1080ti higher tier generation 3080 make sense vram totally increased along performance except highest end model given demand gddr6x yeah correct oohhh damn well x570 mobo one step right direction ty info yeah think 6800 sleeper card honestly based performance look 3070 ti might explain nvidia scrapped 3070 ti plan seem strange put model match value proposition 3070 willing spend upwards 500 surely going nvidia make say announce one thing honestly someone entertaining 3090 6900xt performance per dollar consideration better performing product right kept saying trust benchmark amd drooling 3080 launch think mentioned yes wip hyperbolic lol one know worse already know rdna2 cu work performance equal raster start turning unit rt processing inevitably lose performance understand better rt performance broadcast across rooftop well yeah trying avoid nvidia seen periodic issue thing care mainly vulkan rpcs3 emulator along practice pushing industry price increase plan card capable good gpu encoding since stream lot even 2700x performance drop streaming x264 nvidia nvenc option amd said nothing vein releasing anything decent price perf option today something low mid range nvenc bit performance increase old 390 1660 ti 2060 go lasting purchase 3070 reason 2060 super 2070 super insanely high priced atm even reasonable option unless amd show something else option side 5000 series

performance coming month hopefully early next year actually display port 1 4 pc folk use pretty sure used testing well aware pc monitor house hdmi 2 1 port way even though 4k120 since utilize display port plus always number fps give great picture performance matter whether display output refresh rate performance matter eye question hdmi 2 1 remains relevant requires answering cpu support smart

100 mbps 4g 5 year ee chart amd put stream rage mode smart access enabled beat 3080 3090 sometimes nvidias card stock dl raytracing comparison shown overclocked 3080s 3090s shown heck even compared 6800 2080 ti instead 3070 6800 cost 3070 1080ti still dud card 4 half year old ponying 500 graphic card damn well better sure support feature commonplace next 4 year almost definition future proof mean buying new card release much affect hardly gimmick getting lighting texture quality level ray tracing without actually using ray tracing would sink fps bottom ocean people need stop think tay tracing feature make game look better fps cut really currently efficient way reach best visual performance possible 2 generation developer using ray tracing many lighting effect possible want gpu capable running game decently newest generation need prior generation support using new visual technology literally happened ambient occlusion people bitched made difference cost fps consider staple game nobody notice convenient slightly older gpu support would never fuck scalper rt dl feature available immediately battlefield sure wtf talking lmao performance great nope available took sometime devs know utilize rt control nvidia fix dl version 2 0 got done regardless software available launch albeit unoptimized amd even hmm see many game ray tracing feel super well yet probably next year see suppose glad going nvidia though nvidia heavier valid people nvidia brainer since clearly superior thought new tech 3080 raytraving improves fps def want amd put ray tracing gpus right ray tracing performance important lol measure rasterization performance fps need 1000 4k 120hz tv decent 399 4k 60fps tv decent 299 1440p 144fps monitor way series x cost 700 expect 6800 cost 1000 gpu also need

variable unchecked course supply availability setting consistency value nvenc dl etc precision honestly dl might thing make consider 3080 v 6800xt point well rage mode offer 3 5 iirc think memory optimization better imo better value rx 6800 future proof 299 msrp v 10400f usually 190 160 microcenter non f fair comparison budget shopper 5600 win raw performance neither hold 3070 back might well minmax mostly going minimum required bottleneck gpu intel need k chip fast enough amd need x chip 400f usually much cheaper 3600 non x anyway 5600 non x 10400f probably trade blow pure gaming 3070 level 3080 3090 level change bit dl tensor core hardware ray tracing rtx io proof driver support benchmark meaningless actual performance perform similarly benchmark amd support nvidia 80 nvidia

performance regardless get performance got ten time vram care smart access memory look cool good leverage extra bandwidth pcie gen4 yeah insane price knew person mate slap even considering paying lol good decision end part end far better overall rig rather wait till 2021 pay 700 premium course compared 3600 3080 release stats radeon would pretty big lie declaration wrong true could happen though

benchmark think always wait better one haha feel nvidia sleeve already nice already dropped best version finally bought 1440p high hz monitor keen upgrade glad hear worth honestly got mighty tempted burn cash reason sound cool sure resist certainly hardest thing justify ever better nvidia us 320 350 watt relatively worse perfomance without overclock expecting price cut either side assuming new

huge step far definitely greater rt future nvidias game experience r cant remember sure dl crutch least generation amazing breakthrough gpu arch happens work real nice problem see game utilizing open

suggesting 6800xt close 6900xt 7nm scale way better 8nm aib 6800 xt would probably able match 3090 overclocking 3080 almost match 3090 see flat make sense yeah make sense freesync 2 0b ok samsung tv hdmi 2 1 forum vrr issue mention hdmi 2 1 6000 series well 3090 care fanciest game fanciest graphic would rather 20 95 game 50 5 game buying budget card imagine 1st one dl frankly good till 2 0 honestly one game per season support 3 4 month nvidia sold every 3070 produce amd greedy pricing 6800 bad choice overall certainly matched 3070 price double vram 3070 80 buck seems good deal especially since run par slightly 3070 ya see bigger release number awesome input thanks let see get announced waiting game hopefully info lower tier amd gpu coming day oh right however built pc last year one important detail could use ssd gpu pcie 4 0 motherboard enough bandwidth support timeé choose one wanted use pcie 4 0 even know consider speed space take worth cpu gpu combo pretty much problem running game 2560x1440 high refresh rate gotchu homie meme enjoy problem mate would 5800x anyway yeah buy card amd card us much le power thats deal breaker people also amd looking probs would able add feature nvidia relevant david mitchell definition known meant guess need call name professor far dumbass assure chill lol phrase actually make sense given context something explode usb c though anyway yeah may problematic two display port usb c vr though index unfortunately might predate whole point usb c gpus single cable vr solution depends headset however 8gb le vram forgot fact people buying 3090 difference 1000 1500 100 150 regular people imagine rx 6900xt 100 3090 150 pay extra 50 8gb vram little performance lmfaoooo result using rage mode aka gpu overclock need see real bench oc v oc case probably stuck cuda really choice 3090 still king need cuda pure gaming 6900xt far better value look dl 1 0 fucking hot garbage unusable trash would agree point fact bring 1 0 mean know 2 0 sure something outdated relevant guessing actually card bitter saying buy something something longer used bad sense even make know tomorrow everyone play watch dog 2 rtx card going turn dl sure torn bad past really dumb logic end sorry mistake 5900x seems kill yes cant wait see official benchmark decide change cooler cooler paste 1600 hot know never buy anything without looking several benchmark amd lot user base input first fucken 2020 exciting time tho actually 2 legit option yay competition hmm interesting considering upgrade 1070 eventually radeon card age typically wrong amd driver day game bug glitch etc yeah else brag marketing 101 fact made mention rt perf telling performance yeah see amd stock lol mean want extra frame dl choice trade blow without dl dl would smoke 6800xt use tiny bit power much talking amd driver guess video editing worth gaming ddr6x faster big difference end day nvidia bet gddr6x wider bus would result better performance sure probably make sense sure infinity cache gddr6 thinner bus compare sure need wait benchmark cache could amazing could problematic way know test however direct storage impact either option simplify question 500gb memory large cache 1 000gb memory smaller cache look exact number direct storage say 2 8gbps system loading memory couple order magnitude lower good luck finding rtx 3070 speaking actually guarantee find rtx 3070 stock even seen benchmark yet already saying wait bit biased mean google plenty tweet reddit post thread nvidia forum still solution stop using voice http reddit com r pcmasterrace comment i4niqh rtx_voice_loud_screeching_issue yup always wait review never buy scalper 3090 serious productivity folk gaming added 24gb probably worth price tag yes work done software appears 3070 2080ti rt leak rdna2 would wager 6800 better 3070 across board nvidia launch 3070ti compete showed 6800 beating 2080ti comfortably 15 iirc oof dang quite bit much wonder 10 20 better 3070 perhaps said 18 average yeah choice mostly buying cyberpunk though choice easier talked fidelityfx coming super resolution added fidelityfx version dl oh definitely seems xt way go currently adrenaline working dl seems incredible fuckin e c mean performance comparison price comparison way better value probs comparing overclocked card smart access memory stock competition card exactly productive 170 mhz mean amd efficiency crown great driver dl second gen ray tracing make well worth additional 50 benchmark amd shown nvidia card dl improvement dl provides insane native amd really priced least 6800 6800xt 100 lower due one thing alone still even 6800xt 550 price point pay additional 150 3080 love amd full support hope keep innovating chipping away nvidia though going enjoy 3080 reevaluate next upgrade cycle definitely likely would december 6900 come set reminder really want likely since price difference little 6900 really terrible idea aorus 850 msrp either saving money spending little bit equivalent change performance dl useless game going use list extremely small future list still pretty small feature nvidia software side use accomplished want amd software side bought 3080 1440p 144hz performance achieve le markup future proof 150 upgrade 4k monitor also 16gb vram might age nicely quite useless 1080p fair issue really selling card even acknowledged would nice came said whole product stack generation detailed spec release date high end card rough release window budget card detailed spec come closer release basically difference three card generation expect 3060 december january 3050 sometime q1 2021 stand even really know far 3000 series 6000 series amd case extend even going make new card refresh 5500 call day going budget 3000 card weird sub generation last time 2600 seem hard answer question need 3rd party testing verify 1080 rock 1440p 144hz everything maxed overkill opinion buy 6800xt instead buttery smooth fully rendered 1440p 144hz nut want game 60hz 4k anyway yeah hoping competitive price amd base unit basically 120 think still picking 3070 month two plus answer dl 2 0 need make titan cause 3090 basically already one 1080p mostly wanting extra compute power though 5800x draw max 142w since max am4 socket thats 400w ur gpu cpu run absolute max think good good quality psu actually output specified voltage mean actually know accomplished desktop gpus xbox series x using custom ray box triangle unit standard texture unit sharing resource mixed custom accel assume similar desktop part kept pretty quiet rt architecture general support exists hardware accelerated raytracing posted 1 min video youtube recapping feature stated yeah right commented excitedly see anyone using rt withouth dl equivalent control destoryed 2080ti 3440x1440 rt dl necessary yeah game done use much memory 1440p except maybe flight simulator sure others max setting ever plan switch 4k resolution go amd card maybe back day look 3080 v 3090 10 performance difference two nothing 10gb v 24gb gaming matter nvidia would never released 3080 matter source presentation amd website say based amd said mobo support gen 4 know detail hope gen 4 system support mining champion confirm got one 550 watt never great gaming always budget build screw upgrade option yup always issue launch major product day pretty sure need 5000 series cpu beat 3070 plus literally double vram totally agree dl somewhat game changer since 2 0 nvidia still good value department well wait see amd response oh hope overclock farther rage mode without increasing power limit thanks correction using va api ob shotcut ffmpeg ryzen laptop nvenc program desktop nvidia card work seamlessly usecases streaming quick dirty rendering h264 h265 hevc done extensive testing though honestly whatever stock point average game need pc anymore anyway xbox series x enough majority gamers 4k 60fps 499 gig double dumb analogy try harder 6800 yes 3070 absolutely better performance 6800 ray tracing enabled making declarative statement idea say true know ray tracing look far steve gn said support dxr vulcan sure support feature idea amd super resolution look note nvidia dsr since 900 series also zero clue amd driver promising delivering year maybe changed maybe doubt either senior leader amd nvidia know rest u mid high mid high im saying high end term next gen powerful id call mid end mid range 350 450 people may think pay 500 play 1080p definitely gpu paired cpu gonna perform way still feature card also incentivize user switch intel ryzen pairing new cpu new gpu ofc kind

system time one archived post promised around 2018 fulfilled yet absolutely work especially amd powered console support vrr worry amd card work fine dl biggest thing amd still implementing nvidia second iteration yeah made apparent 3080 pricing nvidia came gate competitively priced complaining power card problem price point nvidia better driver far even close amd playing catch price card accordingly benchmark show advantage feature straight game performance already tell fact nvidia absolutely destroy card support feature exactly amd market support need working closely developer giving

offering slower card advantage theoretical real world benchmark yeah im willing turn setting run stuff higher fps 499 3070 still probably one try stock low hopeful technically know good bad raytracing super resolution yet wait benchmark based assumption person already gaming pc would swap gpu mention plus tax usually gpu use person discount code either cover tax shipping least done nvidia card person already pc would need swap gpu part shit gpu fix problem sure go console damn got sure safe assume person already pc swap gpu case gpu would better buy always case upsampling lowering setting usually dont notice better performance nothing new dl ppl duped thinking great always bad fraction percentage bad thanks correction negatory give ton info 999 card apparently competes 3090 1499 woulda nice 3070 competitor though something 400 450 maybe next year would true 2 year ago much console ray tracing well game adopting really big title past ray tracing performance matter stage believe thing happened anti aliasing first introduced tanked performance people said thing nowadays however aa standard mistakken gcn generation amd always improved lot overtime driver update nvidia 8 extra cu 300 simply better binning probably far fewer navi 21 gpus run 80 cu 2ghz speed also ask question rtx 3090 got core percentage wise compared 3080 double vram cost twice much 6900xt price also high simply 3090 1499 kinda agree 6800xt price aggressive make 6800 look bit meh never know amd pulling bios unlock card 5700 unlocked 5700xt remember 6800 6800xt die lucky 6800xt 70 le dl rtx voice software

adequate 20gb 3080 would around 999 based expensive gddr6x pricing 6900xt performance gain 10gb 3080 would horrible matchup nvidia fuck even stock unable make stock minority right generation go game control anything go playing next gen game 4k 60 going tough without ridiculously high end card getting essentially native 4k image quality v 1800p quality paying 50 dollar likely getting much better rt performance would use inferior feature save extra 50 look market segment kind people willing shell 650 gpu absolutely willing shell 700 feature better saying consider 6900xt probably never considering 3090 fair guess focus show piece near end talked dx12 ultimate showcased godfall mentioning ray tracing related feature utilized point press release vulture reporting detail dug treasure next day week begs question already implied leave rt performance think tradeoff shiny lighting worth framerate tradeoff anything except top tier nvidia card buy 1440p 144hz monitor play game 54 fps 1200p rt yeah feature performance likely worse show may well right well guessing keep mind amd seems new upscaling technology really talked launch know well perform well consider nice third party benchmark verify claim also see performance directly compared still faster card money worst case slightly anything wrong paying plenty people bought 2070s 5700xt even 5700xt value king yeah could option something 2070s think gonna keep 1660s wait spring amd might release something decent value saying even decent 3070 cost much 5800 cross price make sense waiting see much 6800xt going end gbp oresentatjon showed native 4k performance look pretty good price yea dl feel nvidia future proof card native 4k becomes unplayable 3000 series 4 year turn dl give boost assuming dl continues supported future yeah exactly got anything well remember octane redshift already mac using metal pushed done first vulkin drx 2nd since mac kinda left lurch nice powerful rendering platform good competition good thing industry consumer adobe suite primarily especially effect yes private leaker goodluck getting 3070 fe price hope enjoy 2 year 8gb still good enough even think anything gaming though started saying stuff mlid else say actually want taken seriously talking would written post word information maybe even based fact would great mlid rogame igorsl lab naaf others ugh stopped watching kind people saw basically info bigger channel construct narrative twist actually engage gain publicity plus whole suicide attempt twitter never support group forever big would rather listen say thought research etc one thing people work leech others repackage publish 3070 beat 2080ti roughly equal saying still better value 6800 showed 20 average gain rtx 2080 ti rtx 3070 slower also double vram 6800 18 faster 2080 ti 3070 3 5 v 2080 ti top end gpu used cost 300 buck anything higher bom milking damn consumer imo agreed dropping 6900xt 750 woulda r9 290x 2 0 moment would brought entire pricing

wise business sense piece juicy pie company without nvidia shamelessness amd dared charge grand nature duopoly need fix price one side raise market price coming ever edit cute people think discount somehow benevolent move though amd think maximally charge mindshare v nvidia company guy try maximize profit agree 3080 pricing either availability remains seen 6800 series also saying people arrogant amd announced today crawling saying oh muh dl mean good news u cusotmers competition expect price go last look broad trend gaming subreddits outside amd bubble reflects correct assessment slow grow gpu market share ryzen providing better product lower price v 6 core 8 core intel sku seen play many time yo even amd clearly top performance lost almighty ad dollar p4 1060 v rx 580 etc cant compete stock sell ignoring 500 dollar saving think said rage mode would probably add 1 2 performance gain could argue nvidia card thing boost clock power draw increase sure much smart cache could add though thank 100 sure oh necessarely talking last generation 3 generation amd card last 4 year though driver always pain maybe better time tell 6800 ram luck might able unlocked 6800xt wait without gpu old

mismanaging entire release whole one ever know sure say probably combination thing haha shit yup probably fact probability tsmc 7nm shitshow samsung 8nm mean saving 50 performance indeed slightly better slightly worse depending game still buy nvidia yes correct fanboying trash nvidia comment nvidia going route intel right 2000 series 3000 series show much value money amd underdog trying earn

including timestamp statement regarding super resolution compete dl far understand know yet know provide competitor dl yes rtx thats nvidia marketing rt hardware software stack us dxr vkrt run amd rt maybe ready yet maybe make another announcement sure seem performance concern rather basic support ray tracing vulkan based game using proprietary nvidia vulkan extension meaning quake 2 rtx happens open source game implement ray tracing without using dxr quake 2 rtx curious let hope navi 22 card come soon enough hoping rx 5700xt falling 300 next month happen 6800 currently available announced price buy 6800 worth new feature better performance future 1440p 75hz monitor high interest raytracing 5700xt get really cheap go one sure apparently 6800 bit faster game least without raytracing really wanna know hold independent benchmark lot turing card market worth nothing good know thank luck every site germany nvidia site fucked right every reseller site one notebook billiger worked

approximately around 6700 xt roughly 40 cu going build new pc gaming want last say 5 year good performance matching exceeding console match console raw hardware performance possible want fewer core

people complaining fooling anyone buy thats keep raising price u pegged honestly actually 4k 120hz monitor definitely tv push number either neither people know outside rich youtubers review jockey many people doyou know top tier everything 1440 really starting take large majority still running 1080p think say would significantly reduced performance pretty hyperbolic considering announced yet yeah 4k monster better last gen compared card similar tier way always upscaled experience fair upscaled experience likely future pc dl indication depends game xbox one x lot native 4k title v ps4 pro pretty much always 30fps high benchmark performance pc gamers always expect 60fps greater optimization get far really overblown xbox one x 480 580 level performance talking newer edition slightly better predecessor new entry better last year high end 760 par 670 beating 950ti par 770 etc talking gradual improvement talking entry level beating 1200 card whether 1200 inflated different 780ti

amd always playing catch nvidia people accepted ok price cheap cheap people still defend behind next gen feature yeah rage enabled rage actual important one overclocking highly doubt sam going make

raytracing super resolution amd equivalent kind people bought 5700xt instead rtx2080 missed rt fucking fool guy amirite performance hit 3080 raytracing still big ever consider using raytracing let

nvidia pushing gsync sure year two think said dl equivalent coming soon ready talk yet gsync experience free sync work well pay extra 200 compatible monitor sure good driver launch yeah encoder plus nvidia think enough pro con brand right answer better card gen last gen 5700xt 70series competitor expect 6700xt 3070 competitor even tho announced yet doubt release one also 6800 16gb vram 3070 8gb first reason seen semi personal rig make money fallen far behind 2yrs every new title requires 8gb vram gtx770 say troll make good buy imo 3090 way overpriced vr run super great 480rx ps4 sure series

chunk better pricing make sensish double ram performance yeah hard pas sent brother rx590 driver issue bought rtx 2060s zero issue 2060 brother also driver issue rx590 pulled system within week yeah hold release another year suggesting hell acceptable saying least stuck bad driver forever explain comparable better performance lower price translates disappointment mind moore law dead said telling

benchmark making decision independent benchmark come still early make judgement good card compare term performance price etc would surprised going bundle later gpu motherboards cpu really gonna hit

driver ready go driver thermal mostly also lack dl 50 le enough take risk amd card think amd banking nvidia come 2000 generation price got caught cut price way back mean able use raytracing effect typically happen aside pre built machine never seen gpu bundle completely different thing yes yes still kinda suck suspect people claim dl must tier feature never tried 4k 120hz display already exists amd mention anything ray tracing ray tracing implementation hot garbage fanboi really naive know anything good shown presentation lmao amd fanboys delusional expensive offer point price 150 cheaper

going upgrade year two 500 big psychological barrier lot people would buy 3070 1440p gaming would buy 6800xt 4k gaming buy 6800 either 6700xt give 3070 scare 449 though think tough choice 70 chump change amd seem dl answer yet ray tracing performance yet compared 6080 significantly memory bit performance otherwise without crystal ball sure card make sense 2 3 year 70 usd le still good performance dl potentially better rt stable driver forget nvidia mindshare idk man 580 dollar seems massive guff mean point go high end expecting 6800 6900 budget personally getting little old waiting new 400 card though mean 300 400 card 6700xt released 3 6 month imagine shitty unoptimized port always gaming console gaming pc two different market right sony optimized game easy port well literally

congrats winning lottery read comment day person chalked issue driver try troubleshooting anything software adding pcie cable fix issue time tried late even try rma card driver issue made people forget faulty hardware thing reliable way telling one bad hardware one setup incorrectly using one pci e cable instead two one freesync issue monitor bad clear hopefully rx6000 work flawlessly freesync include recommendation plug gpu correctly amd turn confusion around favor gamers go way go listened fixed shitty driver yeah guess always one year anyway im fanboy lmfao subscribed nvidia subreddit consumer someone awaiting amd move decide buy 3080 really fucked save 40 dollar possible driver problem dl slower ray tracing also possible worse performance overall raw performance priority competition something dl supported big aaa game including cyberpunk antecipated game decade info ray tracing dl doesnt matter people lmao yeah people pay 700 gpu dont care graphic performance right meant rude would licking as whining without knowing shit lmao point laugh fool bought though exactly kept labeled titan one would cared would great deal compared past generation even even called titan

watt card allow crank power limit 140 stock limit case 5900xt would draw 420 watt know power target rage mode might also might 330 watt point still stand one card running stock one higher default set

amd surprised u today feel even thought top end card would barely touch rtx 3080 let alone compete nvidia best example ray tracing insanely computationally expensive ever push higher higher resolution jumping 1080p 1440p 4k already adding big load gpus ray tracing exacerbates essentially enabling ray tracing half performance huge performance hit think agree 1 exactly dl important negates halving ray tracing 2 guarantee devs could move away completely fake baking lighting cube map use rtx would know still long way away unfortunately yes computationally expensive also far easier devs implement physic based work box without hundred hour make cube map hit generally getting ray tracing effect certain area example ray traced environmental lighting effect muzzle fire trade lighting option used severe performance penalty yep absolute best implementation control far see good cyberpunk implementation albeit would bet extremely good given close partnership nvidia said implementation still computational cost high best cast 1 2 ray per pixel enormously far cry realistic rendering theoretically say need cast 500 ray per pixel simulate true even 1 2 ray per pixel still extremely obvious ray tracing active game implemented properly see metro exodus global illumination control everything thus regardless full ray tracing still several visual benefit well worth imo trying move thing forward struggling performance hit severe casting abysmal amount ray end massively noisy image requires effort denoise make performance awful supersampling upscale true honestly think ray tracing premature way forward completely agree amount ray cast limitation type lighting apply cost incurs current resolution remedy denoising upsampling fix huge meh think premature mean anymore time 1st variation hell first couple variation new tech always going seem premature whenever new issue arise ever pas said premature phase never developed however technology need continue advance think amd approach hybridization bvh traversal make sense push traditional rasterization support rt leverage cu enable without dedicating huge portion die leverage effect tradeoff performance make sense visually sure agree probably way forward within next decade nvidia seems correctly igorslab leak whose raster benchmark matched shown presentation rt performance worse amd amd also said working dl

nvidia mindshare marketshare ahead 99 game already top 120 fps halo card anyway even need dl begin really need newest triple game hmmm assume updated bios chipset driver sound everything right know yeah proper mid range mid price product biggest market let real 6800 really seem good future proof bussines move think way still guess sound professional stuff professional still side nvidia 3090 bc

easy sure also good recourse http pcgamer com uk amd market share gain q1 2020 definitely fair enough may misread trying say said thing point 1 think thrust original point pushing power supply closer 100 us power trying efficient aiming max psu time e g run psu 20 load run 20 load way worded point made sound trying say true trying run near 50 load whatever max efficiency simply case 1000w psu need 200w 85 efficiency aka bronze rated psu using 240w rounded run 50 load still going using 500 twice much power even psu magically 100 efficient think might line mathematical reasoning make people rage progressive income tax haha 2 actually find manufacturer datasheets cheaper psus guess manufacturer care much p minimum certified bronze silver gold rating found wikipedia assuming op discussing actual rated psus think fair assumption see efficiency across board varies 2 4 minimum manufacturer certainly free make efficient psus e g silver rated psu 99 efficient 50 load think datasheet linked show 3 variation pretty typical cover vast majority psu market top class psus seem implying 3 expand original point think actually stronger case stated first taking 750w psu example 3 difference even 22 5w efficiency calculated voltage question mean 50 efficiency need multiple 375w 3 measly 12w look graph net power consumed v load function strictly monotonically increasing although slope change different point always positive never use le power running higher load anyway thank pointing strictly speaking efficiency decrease higher load necessarily mean people think mean someone bit background
