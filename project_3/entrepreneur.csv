,Entrepreneur,"I thought I'd share the story, in moderate detail, of the first few months of my company, [Ben and Ben Co.](https://www.benandben.co)

I started making hot sauce a little over a year ago on my own and just experimenting with things. I got into fermenting and started giving sauces away to friends and iterating based on feedback. A few months ago I found out my friends roommate was into pickling things, and approached him about working on making some stuff with me. We developed a few hot sauce recipes together, until we refined four specific recipes, and continued distributing to our friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

On August 3rd, I launched our Instagram on a whim while having a beer at a local beer garden. From there things just kind of took on a life of their own; we followed people we know, word spread, started getting orders through DM's. We were making everything in my kitchen in one gallon glass vessels. 

&amp;#x200B;

As demand ballooned, we faced a few simultaneous issues, and began learning a ton about what was ahead of us. We struggled to keep up with orders, so I coded up a simple webpage order form that would send orders to my email address and give people a place to see what was available. This was soon replaced with a Shopify page that handled all of the orders in a much more logical and holistic way. We knew that the initial spike of demand was due to what we called the ""novelty curve"" - our friends and family and their friends were all ordering to support us and because this was a new, exciting thing; so we anticipated demand to fall after the first couple months. We knew as this died down, our runway of revenue to reinvest in expansion would dry up, so we'd have to either invest in advertisement or find a venue to get our product in front of strangers. Both options required meeting some degree of food-related regulation. 

&amp;#x200B;

We used the first $1.5k of initial revenue (we have, so far, operated at roughly \~$0 net profit, meaning we're still breaking even without taking any outside investment and without putting really any of our own savings into it - all revenue went into expansion) expanding production and getting our legal affairs in order; we formed a partnership, got food safety sanitation manager licenses, got business insurance, lined up space at a shared kitchen, invested in 5 gallon fermenters, got a membership at a local Restaurant Depot, and started producing at a much larger scale. We got all our ducks in a row to get into the local farmers market, and just this past week had our first day there; on a cold November day in the middle of a pandemic, we sold 62 bottles to mostly strangers, grossing $496 in revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

What's next for us is to probably continue at our current rate of production for a few more Farmer's Market cycles while getting our department of revenue affairs in order to hire some help to run other farmer's markets and assist in the kitchen. After this, we intend to look for a good, nearby co-packer to handle production for us so we can focus on expanding the brand and finding new opportunities.

You can see the original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jzngv0/100k_in_100_days_challenge/)

Actions Taken:

* Continuing LinkedIn Outreach for Web Development Services through [Barnum Creative](https://barnumcreative.ca)
* Began writing the [Powerful Persuasive Email Course](https://newsletter.powerfulpersuasive.com)
* Wasted time (I spent a lot of time refreshing the page on some pretty weak analytics)
* Upgraded to [ConvertKit Creator Pro](https://app.convertkit.com/referrals/l/4cc2fac8-b155-49ac-a9fe-b099c040d7ab) \- the reason for this was so that I could actually created automated sequences, and using their free SparkLoop integration (call scheduled with the Spark Loop team tomorrow to figure out a solid email referral program)

The Results:

* 15 Visits to the PowerfulPersuasive Home Page
* 3 New Email Subscribers

Analysis:

Like I said, the results weren't **phenomenal,** but it's exciting seeing other people excited in what I'm working on.

I noticed that the landing page for [The One Week Persuasion Course](https://newsletter.powerfulpersuasive.com) is converting at 8.88% and ConvertKit reports that the [average landing page converts at 2.35%](https://convertkit.com/landing-page-conversion-rates).   


Which means that I'm converting at 378% higher than average. So there must be something to the Persuasion Pillars I'm defining. I'm going to calibrate a little bit more to get to that 11% conversion rate that ConvertKit has reported for the top 10% of landing pages

Actions I'm Taking Next:

* Follow up with Reddit User who wanted to collaborate on building a copywriting community
* Begin coding the Reading List page that has been reported as broken
* Write the next 2 days of the email course

Greetings,

My father started a couple years ago a transport company (heavy carrier, 40 tons trucks).

I left my warm job in corporation and I joined him, took my license and start driving those monsters.

As a small company, you kinda never get to work directly with final customer, you always had a middle company, a shipping company.

I soon realised that in order to be more profitable, I must expand the activity and start doing both things.

I made all the legal arrangements and I moved from steering wheel back to desk.

Honestly, at first, I didn't had too much experience but it was pretty easy to figure out how the things works. You negociate with the customer for a price and give like 85-90% of that to the carrier. Risks are involved both ways but at bottom line you don't have too many expenses.

The competition for clients (like in any other business) is extremely agressive but i'm trying to figure out a plan to be more attractive to customers in order to move their freight.

So, why I made this post:

1. First of all I would like any feedback from anyone since i started doing this with 0 experience.
2. I would love to hear how this business works in other parts of the world (my company is in Eastern Europe).
3. Any idea or practices to reach out customers, at this moment i'm building a network on Linkedin and I will try to reach people.",t2_2i43xjyn,False,,0,False,Freight Company,[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,True,t3_k1d6ge,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606416537.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings,&lt;/p&gt;

Say the average kid goes to college and racks up around 80,000 in debt across the 4 years. During these 4 years they don’t exactly learn everything needed to know to come in and make a huge impact at your buisness. So, they are already needing a higher paying job due to the fact they are in debt and also not making a huge impact immediately. 

So, instead of hiring kids out of college you hire them straight out of high school. You can pay them dirt cheap and also teach them the ins and outs of your buisness. These kids would be much cheaper and more efficient than someone who graduates college.

,Entrepreneur,"Getting a potential client on the phone and having a great conversation seems like most of the battle in the early days of starting a business. However, you’ll soon learn - like I did - that moving the conversation from “just a conversation” to an actual sale is 99% of the work!

Luckily, by now I’ve come across every kind of sale situation you can think of, here are just a handful of difficult ones that come to mind:

* People asking me to meet them for coffee, and then having to answer a bunch of questions on the spot
* People asking me to create a strategy and proposal for them without telling me any of the details of what they need.
* People asking me to have multiple calls with them to explain my strategy, veering into me actually educating them

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, by now I’ve come across every kind of sale situation you can think of, here are just a handful of difficult ones that come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;People asking me to meet them for coffee, and then having to answer a bunch of questions on the spot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People asking me to create a strategy and proposal for them without telling me any of the details of what they need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People asking me to have multiple calls with them to explain my strategy, veering into me actually educating them&lt;/li&gt;

It's essentially my 2-cent view on how founders can de-risk their product-building process and find a product that their customers will love.

In short, for founders to de-risk their product development process, they need to get into a mindset of hypothesis testing before building or designing, anything. 

You'll need to find the right people who can validate your hypothesis -- your target users -- and establish a long-term partnership with them so that they continuously help with your product development process as you continuously iterate on a hypothesis that eventually leads to an MVP. 

The essence of such a relationship is that should ultimately become your first ever customers.

It seems scary at first, especially when you start reading resources online with lots of jargon. The reality is, sales is not that complicated to understand. To excel at it, you just need practice.

,Entrepreneur,"I’d love to hear experience shares from others who have done this and how it panned out! I’m currently IN this process and not looking for advice, but knowing what to expect down the line could be helpful. 

My product is currently an $8/mo subscription (weekly meal prep plans, grocery lists, recipes) and we have about 4300 members at the moment. 

We just wrapped up a custom built site that will make our product a lot better, and are raising our monthly price by $2 across the board. It’s not a lot, but it’s still scary and I know my audience is very price sensitive!

So far, we gave current members a heads up about the price increase and gave them an opportunity to upgrade to a long-term membership now at a lower price. In this announcement we shared a sneak peek of our new site. 

The reaction has been overwhelmingly positive! Our current members are stoked to use the new site and so many of them have already upgraded to long term memberships making today one of our best sales days ever. 

It’s rare that we ever get to create a sense of scarcity/urgency with a subscription product so I’m excited to see what that does for sales in the next month before officially making the switch to our new pricing. 

We announce the price increase to the public on Saturday. I’m nervous but hopeful!

&lt;p&gt;My product is currently an $8/mo subscription (weekly meal prep plans, grocery lists, recipes) and we have about 4300 members at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just wrapped up a custom built site that will make our product a lot better, and are raising our monthly price by $2 across the board. It’s not a lot, but it’s still scary and I know my audience is very price sensitive!&lt;/p&gt;

Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier
 
 
 
 
The Book’s Main Idea
 
 
Rework is a book that shows readers how they it is not always a must to have tons of cash and other resources to start a business. After reading this book, you will understand and appreciate the fact that it is actually possible to run a business and turn it into a successful venture by just investing in minimal amount of effort and resources.
 
 
It is a power-packed advice that offers some real, authentic and pragmatic advice to the readers. 
 
 
One of the powerful pieces of advice shared by the authors in the book is:
 
 
“If you want to do something, you’ve got to do it now. You can’t put it on a shelf and wait two months to get around to it. You can’t just say you’ll do it later. Later, you won’t be pumped up about it anymore. Inspiration is a magical thing, a productivity multiplier, a motivator. But it won’t wait for you. Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to work.”
 
 
The book begins with the two authors discussing how the business world has changed radically over the past two decades and it is now quite normal for anyone to have their business without having a huge investment. 
 
 
This summary covers the main points covered in the book. I will cover several parts broadly:
 
 
 
 
1: Failure, Growth and Workaholics
 
 
This part debunks some myths about success and failure where the authors highlight the point that failure is not always a precondition for being successful in life, and one does not always benefit from learning from their mistakes. Fried and Heinemeier also emphasize on how one should not always expect to expand their small business and it is okay if someone does not wish to achieve massive growth because what’s more important is that you keep your business afloat. Lastly, they discuss how often, people who appear to be workaholics aren’t as productive as they are perceived to be because they waste a lot of time worrying about tiny details.
 
 
 
 
2: Getting Started
 
 
In this part, the authors talk about how the term ‘entrepreneur’ often makes people associate many expectations with starting one’s business. Instead of focusing on that, one should concentrate on being a starter and just start off with their business which doesn’t require anyone to have a business degree and only focus on exactly what needs to be done.
 
 
 
 
3: Make Progress
 
 
This part discusses different aspects associated with making progress in business. Heinemeier and Fried explain constraints/challenges are part of the process when starting and running a business. They (the authors) then go ahead to explain the need for a positive outlook if success is to be realized in the midst of the challenges. According to the book, a positive outlook provides a conducive environment for creativity, which translates to solving of problems innovatively. 
 
 
The book also talks about how one should build a good product, which focuses on solving one solution/aspect and making it as good as possible instead of cramming 10 different ideas into that same product and turning into a ‘half-assed’ product as they call it which lacks structure.
 
 
 
 
4: Be Productive
 
 
In this part, the authors talk about the different interruptions that often limit productivity such that people don’t get much done even after working for long hours. According to the book, one of the biggest killers of productivity is endless meetings that lack any agenda and structure so if one has to have a meeting, it must be on a clear agenda, should begin on time and have only the concerned people involved in it.
 
 
The authors talk about how essential it is to build momentum in business to stay motivated and achieve progress as well as how that can best be achieved through completing tasks effectively and then starting off with the next one as quickly as one can.
 
 
 
 
5: Competition
 
 
This part highlights how competition is an inevitable factor in the corporate world and often when entrepreneurs encounter competition, they have an urge to copy competitors. 
 
 
The authors emphasize on avoiding that urge at all costs and always creating their own mark by being authentic in their business. They also stress on the importance of not always having to do a lot to be successful in business and instead focusing more on simplifying the problems experienced by the target audience. 
 
 
 
 
6: Promotions
 
 
This part of the book talks about how it is important to promote a business in a manner that it makes the audience come directly towards it. This can happen if entrepreneurs create a base of loyal customers who spread good word of mouth about their work. The authors also advise readers (entrepreneurs) to teach whatever it is they learn to others, as this helps them grow. 
 
 
They also highlight the need to know everything about everyone and how it is necessary to incorporate this into the business by explaining everything about the business to customers, as this helps them become more invested into it.
 
 
 
 
7: Hiring
 
 
Heinemeier and Fried explain how business owners should try out a certain task before hiring someone for that duty, as this helps them to understand the job properly (including how it needs to be executed). 
 
 
The book then goes on to talk about the need to find experienced people but not stress too much on hiring someone with decades of experience and focus more on looking for someone with the right skill even if he/ she does not have the relevant education for it.
 
 
 
 
8: Damages and Apologies
 
 
In this part, the authors discuss how bad things often happen in businesses and how important it is to accept mistakes, apologize to the people affected by it and address the problem effectively to improve on it. They also stress on the significance of treating customers as kings and providing them with excellent service.
 
 
 
 
9: Culture is Important
 
 
This part highlights the importance of having a company culture but goes on to educate readers to keep in mind that building a company culture isn’t an overnight process. To build the right culture, business owners MUST understand what they want then train their staff in a manner that they wish to be treated because this treatment will reflect in their behavior and shape the organization’s culture.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey what's up guys!! So with Holiday sales in full gear, I wanted to share a case study that I put together, a case study for a holiday campaign that we ran last year.

This campaign generated $1,011,775.61 in just under two weeks at a 13.7 return on ad spend (ROAs)

I think it would be super beneficial for those of you that are just getting started and also for people getting ready to run your first big sale campaign.

Or maybe you're a seasoned veteran and all of this you already know.

My hope is that you're able to pull at least one Golden Nugget from this post.

Essentially I've broken this case study down into six segments that I think will be helpful. I'll then share the exact audiences that I used in the campaigns, if you want to go try them out.

I want to start with this “Growth Equation”. This is something that really helps me as a principal. It’s used to understand the math behind running paid traffic.

The equation is:

(Visitors) x (Conversion Rate) x (Average Order Value) - (Variable Costs) equals $$$

Okay so now that’s the growth equation, what does it mean??!

Visitors is the amount of traffic that you send to your website.

Conversion rate is the amount of people that when they land on your page, convert into paid customers.

Average Order Value is how much that customer is worth on a first time purchase.  VC is variable costs. Which are your costs of doing business. What are your marketing costs, etc?

So that's the equation, and the reason it’s important is because if you understand the math, you can create a plan for success before any sale or campaign.

With any campaign, always start with the end in mind.

The second thing that I want to talk about is account structure because I see a lot of new advertisers get this wrong. We break our accounts up into basically three segments. We do prospecting which is all cold traffic, we have reengagement which is people that have engaged the brands, and then we have remarketing which is all lower funnel activity website clicks. (Add To Cart, initiate checkouts, purchases etc.)

I think that's really important to understand because your prospecting traffic is going to refill your reengagement and remarketing buckets. It's a natural flow from somebody that's never met you or heard of you before into engaged prospects familiar with your brand down to somebody that has actual buyer intent.

The way I like to look at that is we use a very simple structure that's recommended by Facebook. We do five ad sets per campaign, with three to six ads in each one. By keeping things simple, we allow Facebook to better optimize the traffic.

If you have a large number of ad sets or ads let’s say 10 ad sets and 20 ads, Facebook will try to split the budget between those and it becomes very ineffective. So what we'll do is have three to six ads and then we'll have three to six (or more) backups turned off. When we're able to look at the metrics if ads aren't performing then we can turn them off and then turn others on.

That's the overall account structure again (Campaigns, Ad Sets, Ads). We break the campaigns and audiences down into cold, warm, and then hot traffic.

Next is going to be our bid and budget. Facebook really likes it when you start with higher budgets. I see a lot of people advocate starting with smaller budgets, but that's not how the algorithm does its best work, Facebook recommends that you give the algorithm at least 50 purchases over your optimization window so generally that's 50 purchases over a week.

We like to start with higher budgets, especially during the holidays. It's also an important reason why you use cost caps and manual bidding. We'll get into that in a little bit.

We break our budget down to spend 60/70% on prospecting and then 30/40% on remarketing. The prospecting campaigns will essentially refill the remarketing audiences and allow us to scale.

Another confusing thing for new advertisers is Facebook's default bidding option, what's called “lowest cost” and really what that means is...they spend all my money.

One thing that I did not mention that’s super important is we're going to be targeting conversions in these campaigns, we’ll definitely mix in some other traffic sources but a majority of our traffic is going to be conversions.

The next thing is the offer. It really helps if you’ve gone into the holidays with already built-up audiences.  One of the things that we did was we would move the free shipping up to $120, increasing the average order value so that we could bid more on acquiring a customer. This ended up working really well.

There’s a couple other things for optimizing a high average order value. This is a conversation for another time. Optimizing your AOV or LTV; the higher you can get that the better. If you want some more specifics on that maybe I'll do a separate post. Definitely remember the free shipping bump over $120 though.

Now I want to talk about creative.There’s a couple specific things we’d done with creative. We used  influencer ads from the specific influencer pages to create a sense of social proof. Then we also use last chance ads to drive scarcity and buying behavior, essentially saying that these are the final opportunities to get this offer. The last chance to get it for Black Friday, the last chance it can be shipped off for the holidays.

The last thing that I wanted to touch on is scaling. The way that I like to scale, and scaled specifically during this campaign, was to duplicate campaigns to a higher budget at a manual bid generally; sometimes lowest cost, sometimes a surfing budget. Essentially if you're spending tens of thousands of dollars a day, when you wake up in the morning, you should have a handful of conversions and if you're within your KPI targets and the budget then that can be a much more efficient way than trying to do small budget increases. At least over the last year, it has been an efficient method to scale.

I think that's it.

If you have any questions let me know in the comments!

Let me know what your holiday sale is!! What do you have planned?

I would love to learn something from you guys and hopefully this is helpful for you.

Are you playing the Short Game or the Long Game?

**Short Game** = “Can you start tomorrow? No need for a formal interview, we’ll see how you do”

**Long Game** = “Ok, first step of our hiring process is a phone interview, then an in person interview, than a working interview”

**Short Game** = “I’ll write you a check every Friday after your shift for the hours you worked that week”

**Long Game** = “One thing you’ll love about working with us is that we do everything by the book, you’ll get direct deposit every week and you’ll have a portal to view your paystubs.”

**Short Game** = “Paying for leads is too expensive, I’ll stick with word of mouth”

**Long Game** = “What’s the cost? If I sell just one job, it will most likely pay for the entire monthly expense of the leads”

See the difference?

What I've come to realize in many cases, is that contractors start their business in Fight or Flight mode.

In the beginning, you took all of the work you could...

You hired anyone that had a pulse that would help...

You held onto your money not sure of when the next job would come...

All of that is the short game mindset...and rightfully so especially in the beginning...

But don't live there. Growth comes simply by setting a higher standard for the things of which you do on an everyday basis surrounding the decisions you make in your business. I had this talk during a [breakthrough session](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/contractor-secrets/id1477208973) with Scott Looye. He's a painting contractor and was telling me how the idea of buying leads was so hard for him to entertain for so long, but after a change in thinking, he realized it would be a major benefit if he only sold just one job that paid for the entire month's lead cost. Obviously, he would sell more...but, it's the principle. It's just a different way of thinking. Hope this helps some of you on your r/Entrepreneur journey!
