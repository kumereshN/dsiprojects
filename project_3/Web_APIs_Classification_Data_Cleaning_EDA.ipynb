    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of classifying business owners posts from [r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/) and the posts from [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) as new business owners have issues with identifying creating their own business and investing in a business. With a classifier model, we can use it to seperate business ideas and business investment strategies for new business owners who desire to start their side hustle."
