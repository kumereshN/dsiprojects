    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of classifying business owners posts from [r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/) and the posts from [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) as new business owners have issues with identifying creating their own business and investing in a business. With a classifier model, we can use it to seperate business ideas and business investment strategies for new business owners who desire to start their side hustle."

       " 'link to video i release new videos often if you re interested in subscribing here s a link if you d prefer to read the script instead of watching the video here it is summary of the lean startup by erick reis about the author other than being the author of the lean start up erick reis an american entrepreneur and a blogger is also the author of the start up way a book that talks about modern entrepreneurial management the book s main idea the book s main goal is to help readers avoid the number one mistake that makes start ups fail i e launching a product or a service without the entrepreneur knowing who the product s customer is and what those customers really want to quote the author success is not delivering a feature success is learning how to solve the customer s problem erick reis the lean start up focuses on teaching readers how to better their start up businesses by exposing them to a new way of thinking that is able to mitigate their risk going forward which automatically increases their likelihood of finding a product that sticks the book does that through introducing the readers to a systematic and scientific method that enables them to get all the information they need to make fast and decisive decisions when starting a business the ability to learn faster from customers is the essential competitive advantage that start ups must possess erick reis a look at the main topics discussed in the book here is a taste of what to expect from the three phrases of the book first phase vision in the book reis through his experience explains why start ups fail he tries to make readers understand that the battle for a successful start up is first lost in the vision where entrepreneurs follow a conventional approach of starting a business which dictates that immediately they get an idea and it has been approved by either their friends or family the idea becomes legit and ready to be launched in the market according to the lean start up the conventional approach is wrong because it makes entrepreneurs launch start ups based on untested assumptions which increase the possibility of them creating a perfect product that nobody wants reis says that the first goal of a start up is to figure out the right thing to build the thing that customers will want and will be willing to pay for as quickly as possible under the topic of vision reis teaches the readers how to kick start a start up the right way he uses a super formula which makes the reader better at starting a successful business here is a glimpse of the formula step 1 the reader is taught how to come up with a user experience vision step 2 the reader is taught how to identify critical assumptions on their idea which determines the success of the start up step 3 the reader is educated on how to experiment with critical assumptions here reis uses the zappos example where he explains how nick swinmurn the inventor of zappos came up with a successful business by simply experimenting with his assumption people can buy shoes online by first posting photos of shoes online to test customer demand step 4 the reader is taught how to build an mvp minimum viable product a sample of the reader s product that highlights the main features of their idea but takes less time effort and money to build that they can use to test their idea with second phase steer this phase the book focuses on teaching the reader how to steer his her start up business through using the build measure learn feedback loop formula in the book reis says the lean start up methodology is based on a cycle of rinse and repeat the build measure learn what the reader is taught from the steer phase is how he can identify the leap of faith assumption from his idea he can use various methods

    "There's not a magic bullet recommendation for the right number of plots to understand a given dataset, but visualizing your data is *always* a good idea. Not only does it allow you to quickly convey your findings (even if you have a non-technical audience), it will often reveal trends in your data that escaped you when you were looking only at numbers.\n",

    "From the heatmap, there's high negative correlation between SAT and ACT participation rate with -84% in 2017 and -85% in 2018. This translates to states with high SAT participation rates are more likely to have low ACT participation rates, vice versa.\n",

    "There's an interesting correlation between the score and participation rates. For SAT, the correlation between average total score and participation was -87% in 2017 and -79% in 2018. For ACT, the correlations were -86% in 2017 and -86% in 2018. This shows that the higher the participation, the lower the average total score. This is likely due to students who show greater interest taking the test in cases of low participation and the scores being lower for cases in high participation as the range of student skills become wider.\n",

    "Colorado state officials switched from the mandatory ACT to the mandatory SAT which resulted in a decrease in ACT participation and an increase in SAT participation. The reason behind the switch is that the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) remarked the exam is more closely aligned to the state's academic standards and to prepare them for life after high school. (1) (2)\n",

    "According to the Chicago Tribune, Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) made the switch as well from ACT the SAT after weighing the attributes of both exams and decided SAT's standards was better aligned with Illinois. (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "For both states, the average scores for SAT decreases significantly as a greater number of students took the test while the average scores for the ACT increased as a result of a smaller group of students taking it. For instance, Colorado's SAT scores went from 1201 in 2017 to 1025 in 2018 while the ACT average score went from 20.8 in 2017 to 23.9 in 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Arkansas, the ACT is used as an admission requirement to enter colleges or universities which is why there's a a very high participation rate for ACT and it's considered an \"ACT state\". (4) (5)\n",

Choose one state with a lower participation rate and provide a suggestion for how the College Board might increase participation amongst graduating seniors in this state. Are there additional data you desire that would better inform your investigations?"

    "After reviewing the state college entrance exam testing policy and examining the datasets, there is clear evidence that the respective state's policy has a huge influence in the student's participation in these tests. Currently, there are 25 states that require students to take the [SAT or ACT](https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/states-require-students-take-sat-or-act.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the tests participation to increase, states can choose to enact a policy of making one of the two tests a mandatory high school graduation requirement if they have not done so. This provides benefits to the state's education systems and to the students. One advantage would be that the standardized test can be used to measure the effectiveness of the high-school educational systems. It can also be used to benchmark students and provides students the guidance to complete one common college application requirement. This will be useful in guiding students to consider their school of choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at Illinois, where students are mandated to take a standardized test to enter colleges and universities. After Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) reviewed both tests,  ISBE switched to SAT from ACT. This resulted a large decrease in ACT participation and a large increase in SAT participation from 2017 to 2018. These changes in participation were followed by a decrease in average score for the SAT and an increase in ACT average scores. This shows what happens when a state make a test mandatory - a large drop in the participation rate of the other test.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, states need to provide incentives to encourage students to take both tests. Incentives such as giving students time off for test taking, subsidizing the fees and integrating the test into high school curriculum can help to remove the barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research into other factors such as the median household incomes for each state to see if there's any corrleations into the participation rates would be useful to increase the participation rates."
