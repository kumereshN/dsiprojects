,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,270,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,270,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a new proposal on Tuesday, which could allow companies like Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), and DoorDash to compensate gig economy workers in equity.

What Happened: The regulator has proposed a pilot program for tech aggregators that hire gig economy workers or drivers, under which the companies can pay up to 15% of the worker compensation (not exceeding $75,000 in three years) in stock rather than cash.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,"Uber, Lyft, Doordash Can Pay Gig Workers Up To 15% Compensation in Stock Under New SEC proposal",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k0qn1k,False,dark,0.97,,public,1136,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1136,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1606333020.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

“So what is Microvast?

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year. Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to ~$20 range.

Reminder: Gonna take a couple weeks before it moons (from merger agreement confirmation), BE PATIENT”

Since this is a SPAC, the price floor is $10.22 if the merger doesn’t go through. This means your downside is limited.

I personally moved my entire account into 3050 shares at $10.60.

,investing,"The question isn't \*when\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are &lt; 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

,investing,"APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022. 

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. 

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. 

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, 

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers)) onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

Compared to the maybe outdated Ben Graham rule of price/earnings over 15 being expensive, a P/E of 8 seems like a bargain, unless I'm missing something important about the company or global insurance markets. 

To my understanding, Metlife got out of retail life insurance awhile ago to focus on corporate products, and they have an established global brand.  

So what's the downside keeping the price so low?

The earnings return over time would be 6.12/47.76 = 13%, assuming they can just maintain their past performance, which to me doesn't seem unlikely. 

And there's also a 3.78% dividend, at a pretty sustainable payout ratio of 29.41%.

In comparison, Ford recalled 1.3 mil vehicles from 2014 to 2018 while selling 32.2 mil vehicles in the same time period. Fiat Chrysler also recalled 5.3 mil vehicles made between 2014 and 2018 while logging vehicle sales quantity of more than 400 mil over that period of time. Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/). This means an average of about 1-4% recall per new vehicle sale.

&amp;#x200B;

To me Tesla's ones looks like an abnormally high recall rate.

,investing,"I have around 7k USD in Tesla right now, which is basically all my savings, and as you all know it's been going up a lot since the announcement that they would be added to the S&amp;P list.

Yesterday I figured that this growth would probably continue for the rest of December, since they still need to actually be added to the list. So I thought it would be a good idea to open up a loan with my bank for about 3k and invest it into Tesla. Because you know, leverage!

I believed this could play out in 2 ways.

1. Either Tesla goes up a bunch in the next month and I can pay back my loan with basically 0% interest and let the rest of my profit sit in Tesla.
2. Tesla doesn't go up immediately, or maybe even dip down a bit, and I just let my loan sit there. I have 18 months to pay it back and if I do that then it'll cost me 200 USD interest. But I feel relatively confident that in those 18 months I'll have made more than 200 USD from rising Tesla stock.

But this morning when I woke up I thought, hmmm, what if the stock actually plummets when they get added to the S&amp;P list, because maybe that's the exact moment that a lot of people will think it's the best time to sell their Tesla stock to make some money. I'm a bit scared of that scenario. Even though maybe I have nothing to be afraid of if I just let my money sit there for the full 18 months.

When I search for S&amp;amp;P500 I found out that I need to deposit 500$...&lt;br/&gt;
So I started searching for other things and found something call SPX500 and it had an American flag next to it, I tried to invest there and i found out that i can invest but with leverage&lt;/p&gt;

Tesla has nearly always lost money, though it has had quarterly profits lately that don’t begin to justify the valuation.

The reason for the share surge is, of course, a bet on the future. Investors have noticed that electric cars are quite the fashion.

Traditional car companies are moving away from petrol engines, prompted by changing consumer tastes, ever more urgent calls for action on climate change, and ensuing government rulings.

Tesla has won so far because it was ahead of the curve, it has had the luxury electrical car market almost to itself until now.

Mercedes, BMW, VW and others are now getting their act together and can go to school on Tesla’s mistakes and lessons.

The German, Japanese and indeed the big American auto firms have been around a while for good reason. They are really good at making cars.

As a car driver one problem with Tesla cars, aside from their price is this: they look boring.

From a practical point of view, Tesla does not have enough European presence.

Which means they are likely to run into all sorts of problems with transporting their wares and with tariffs.

The only one I&amp;#39;ve found that seems more comprehensive is this one where they state that using a trailing stop loss is highly superior than a simple buy and hold strategy (the best results are attained with a 15-20% threshold): &lt;a href=""https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;amp;recordOId=1474565&amp;amp;fileOId=2435595""&gt;https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;amp;recordOId=1474565&amp;amp;fileOId=2435595&lt;/a&gt;. They do a couple strong assumptions tho (e.g. they only take into account closing prices and not intra-day variance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the reddit consensus about trailing stop losses? So far, the online evidence seems kinda mixed. Are there some well-known papers out there about this that you could recommend me?&lt;/p&gt;
