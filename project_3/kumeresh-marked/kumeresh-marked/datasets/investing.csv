,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,272,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,272,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

,investing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

&gt;*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

&gt;*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

&gt;*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

&gt;\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

&gt;*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?
2. What year should conclusions be based on?
3. What is a fair valuation?
4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.

,investing,"One  of  Japan's  biggest stock investors just reported record gains of more than  $50 billion  after a well-timed bet. But the person who engineered the windfall won't be getting a  Wall Street -style bonus this holiday season, and some have even started saying he shouldn't play the market so much.

That's because the hot-hitting portfolio manager is Gov.  Haruhiko Kuroda , head of  Japan's  central bank. Mr. Kuroda has led the  Bank of Japan's  push, unusual among global central banks, to invest in the  Tokyo  stock market as a way of rousing the nation's animal spirits.

In March, he doubled the BOJ's annual ceiling for its purchases of exchange-traded funds to the equivalent of  $115 billion . That was the month the stock market began surging after a pandemic-induced dip. It closed Thursday at a 29-year high, up 60% from this year's low.

The superb timing helped the central bank report a record jump for a six- month period in its stock portfolio's gains when it released its semiannual financial report Thursday. It said the market value of its holdings stood at the equivalent of nearly  $400 billion  as of  Sept. 30 , which represented an unrealized profit of  $56 billion  over what it paid.

Six months earlier, the BOJ had barely any unrealized profit left, and at one point in March Mr. Kuroda said it was carrying large losses.

The stock-buying program, which began under Mr. Kuroda's predecessor a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, isn't aimed at making trading profits. It is supposed to encourage broader risk-taking in the economy and ensure that prices are rising at a small and steady clip.

Recently, with inflation stuck around zero, some analysts are questioning whether the program is doing much good--especially during a pandemic, when other factors are weighing on the psychology of consumers and businesses.

Also, the central bank now owns more than 6% of the total value of the  Tokyo  stock market, leading some to wonder whether the premier symbol of capitalism could be undermined by state influence.

 NLI Research Institute  strategist  Shingo Ide  said the central bank's outsize role could hurt corporate governance because it can't act like other shareholders in monitoring company strategy and CEO performance.

""Because such a large unrealized profit means the bank's holdings are also getting bigger and bigger, there will likely be more demand from outside the BOJ to sell the stocks or start thinking about an exit policy,"" said Naomi Muguruma, an economist at  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities .

Ms. Muguruma said the BOJ would feel more comfortable starting such a discussion while it is sitting on profits.

The central bank doesn't directly buy individual stocks but invests in a swath of the market through exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. It bought  $15 billion  in ETFs in March alone, but the pace has slowed significantly in recent months as the market recovers.

Mr. Kuroda said last week that he wasn't thinking of any quick changes in the program, with the stock market one of the bright signs for an economy that is only halfway back from its pandemic bottom.

""We need to prevent any market instability from causing a worsening of business and household confidence,"" Mr. Kuroda told a parliamentary committee. "" The BOJ's ETF purchases were effective in easing instability caused by the impact of coronavirus infections.""

Still, there are signs that a rethink is in its early stages.  One  of the bank's nine policy board members, Takako Masai, said last week that the bank might have to consider tweaking its purchases and alluded to the uncomfortably large size of its holdings.

""It is necessary to have discussions pre-emptively to improve flexibility and nurture the market,"" said Ms. Masai, who used to work at a commercial bank.

A former  Bank of Japan  executive director,  Shigeki Kushida , said in a recent column in a publication for financial analysts that the BOJ could offer to sell its stocks to individual investors through financial firms rather than dumping the ETFs on the open market.

He said that method could avoid market confusion and encourage households to shift their savings into riskier assets from safe but zero-return bank accounts.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,Japan's Stock-Playing Central Bank Racks Up $56 Billion Gain,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k1qzx8,False,dark,0.9,,public,53,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,53,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606466383.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One  of  Japan&amp;#39;s  biggest stock investors just reported record gains of more than  $50 billion  after a well-timed bet.

With the intention to make it a fairer market. The argument being that these algos have a substantial advantage over manual investments by humans, therefore making it an unfair market place.

Sorry for the word wall, just skip it if you want and give me your 2c on the title question.

For those who aren't aware, pretty much all the large investment firms will have a subsidiary of these ""ai"" investors, I say that in quotation, as they are just very complicated programs, that among many other features, can monitor and ""learn"" the current market sentiment and have a constant monitor on all news outlets, relevant social media accounts etc etc.

These aren't your basic level apps that can be used by the general public(again showing an unlevel playing field), basically over the last few decades the financial industry has employed a HUGE amount of top level programmers, engineers, mathematicians etc in a race to create an automated trading system that is better than humans.

If this interests you, I strongly suggest you do some research about ""trading algos"" 

These algos can make 100+ trades within a minute. They are monitoring the market 24/7/365. 
They can research and calculate an investment within seconds, something that would take a person hours.

And besides all this, there is the view that this is unethical trading. The stock market was not intended for an 'investor' to buy and sell a stock 20 times in a day. There is something inherently wrong with this new trading trend being brought in by the big boys. It's not like they were disadvantaged before. I'm sure many of you can agree, the markets are behaving increasingly irrationally recently.
I cant help but think, that once these algos go full on, they are going to be the winners of the market, it's what they are designed to do! And for every win, there is a lose(that's us btw) There's no way the regular investors can compete with them.

Obviously, this would be a very difficult/impossible proposal to push through. 

But who knows, get a few bad ass lawyers who are sick of these assholes shitting on the system. Get some convincing argument about this tech creating unfair playing field, essentially market monopoly(would need ROI for these systems, vs average investors ROI) 

As an end note. We are literally enroute to  putting the world economy in the hands of algorithms, programmed to make profit. They just want numbers to increase in their account. Much like a trader yes. But humans are sentient beings, we don't glitch, we might fat finger every now and then. But we don't glitch, we have reasoning, and biasis, and theory's and stubbornness. It's what makes the market a place for us, to go balls deep, make considered investments, yolo your savings or whatever floats your boat.

,investing,"Salesforce Inc.  has thrived for years as a niche business-software vendor with a chief executive,  Marc Benioff , who has positioned himself as a prominent voice in American business.

Now Mr. Benioff is taking steps that analysts say aim higher, intensifying the company's battle with the industry's biggest player:  Microsoft Corp. 

Salesforce is in advanced talks to acquire  Slack Technologies Inc. ,  The Wall Street Journal  reported Wednesday, in what would be Mr. Benioff's biggest acquisition to date and the company's most direct attack on a market  Microsoft  has identified as critical to its growth.

The deal, which could still fall through, would add fuel to Salesforce's ambition to become the go-to software platform for business customers to use for everything from data analysis to managing customer relationships to even daily communication.

The pandemic has amplified Salesforce's efforts. When Covid-19 broke out, Mr. Benioff quickly launched [w](https://Work.com)ork.com -- a suite of applications companies could use for contract tracing, mental-health checks and shift scheduling.

A deal for Slack could heat up the simmering rivalry between Salesforce and  Microsoft . About five years ago  Microsoft  was in talks to buy Salesforce, but the deal fell apart over price. Salesforce lost out to  Microsoft  in 2016 in bidding for  LinkedIn Corp. , the business-focused social-media network. The loss stung. Salesforce responded by urging regulators to examine  Microsoft's  proposed purchase on antitrust grounds; the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

Landing Slack, which  Microsoft  once tried to acquire, could amount to a bit of revenge for Mr. Benioff.

Having failed to capture Slack,  Microsoft  launched its own workplace collaboration tool, called Teams, spurring a sometimes heated battle between the two companies.

""They want to kill us,"" Slack CEO  Stewart Butterfield  told the Journal earlier this year. This summer, Slack filed a complaint with the  European Union  over alleged antitrust behavior by  Microsoft  in using its dominance to push Teams.

Slack ""extends the footprint of what Salesforce goes after,"" said Jefferies analyst  Brent Thill . ""Not everyone uses a sales system, but everyone can use collaboration. The beauty of Slack and Teams is that it touches everything inside enterprises.""

Mr. Benioff has a history of deal making since he co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago and turned it into one of the most successful companies in the then still nascent market of providing software as a service. Salesforce completed its biggest-ever purchase last year, paying around  $15 billion  in stock for data-analytics platform  Tableau Software Inc. 

A year earlier it splashed out more than  $5 billion  for cloud-application provider MuleSoft. Inc. This year Salesforce said it was buying cloud-software provider  Vlocity Inc. 

Mr. Benioff has long been one of  Silicon Valley's  highest-profile and most outspoken executives, using venues like the  World Economic Forum  in  Davos, Switzerland , to champion causes. He set up Salesforce with a pledge of corporate giving and bought himself an even larger platform with his acquisition of  Time Magazine  two years ago.

The  San Francisco -based company also has made a big push into the emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing tools to help customers make better use of their data. In 2016, it acquired PredictionIO, which makes software for building machine-learning apps. That followed the purchase of MinHash and Tempo AI, two further machine-learning companies. In 2014, it bought RelateIQ, which also specializes in the field.

Breaking into the market of workplace collaboration has long been on Salesforce's agenda. In 2010, it launched Chatter, a private social network for companies to collaborate. And in 2016, it bought cloud-document collaboration app company  Quip Inc.  for more than  $500 million . Neither product attracted a wide following. Acquiring Slack, which Salesforce had previously explored buying, would immediately make the company a big player in the workplace- collaboration market. Slack has more than 130,000 paying customers.

Salesforce, which declined to comment for this article, is pursuing Slack as competition in its core business of customer relationship management software is intensifying.  Adobe Inc.  this month said it would buy Workfront, a platform for marketers, for  $1.5 billion .  Microsoft  also has been pushing its rival product, called Dynamics. Salesforce still has the largest share with 20.1% of the world-wide market in 2019 compared with 2.6% for Microsoft Dynamics, according to research firm  Gartner Inc. 

Even with Slack, Salesforce would be a comparatively small rival to  Microsoft . The  Redmond, Wash. , company had sales of  $143 billion  in its latest financial year, generated by business enterprise software, its cloud-computing infrastructure, and consumer-facing businesses, such as videogaming, which has exploded during the pandemic. Its sales are roughly nine times Salesforce's annual revenue.  Microsoft's  market valuation tops  $1.6 trillion , about six times that of Slack and Salesforce combined.

Last year Salesforce said it was seeking to reach  $28 billion  in annual sales in the 2023 financial year. It had  $16 billion  in sales in its most recent financial year.

""He really needs to keep growing,"" said  Mark Moerdler , senior research analyst at  Bernstein Research , of Mr. Benioff. ""He needs another big acquisition. Slack gives him a big acquisition. It gives him revenue.""

Slack also has been looking to broaden its appeal. Companies have used Slack principally for intra-office communications. In June, the software provider introduced Slack Connect, which allows messages to be sent between different companies. Slack's Mr. Butterfield said the feature has driven a rise in paying customers and should fuel future growth.

But big acquisition plans aren't without pitfalls. When Salesforce tried to buy social-media company  Twitter Inc.  in 2016, Mr. Benioff faced significant pushback from investors and he walked away from the deal. Although Slack is more in the mainstream of Salesforce's business than Twitter, it would still come at a hefty price given Slack's  $17 billion  market value before Wednesday's stock surge.

""Investors don't want Salesforce to do a big deal,"" Mr. Thill of Jefferies said, adding they want the company to show it can generate growth from within.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,"With Slack, Salesforce Would Put Heat on Microsoft",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k1ltlp,False,dark,0.69,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606448234.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce Inc.  has thrived for years as a niche business-software vendor with a chief executive,  Marc Benioff , who has positioned himself as a prominent voice in American business.&lt;/p&gt;

“So what is Microvast?

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year. Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to ~$20 range.

Reminder: Gonna take a couple weeks before it moons (from merger agreement confirmation), BE PATIENT”

Since this is a SPAC, the price floor is $10.22 if the merger doesn’t go through. This means your downside is limited.

They are used in  fighter jets,  MRI,  Cellphones etc.    Most importantly they are in EVs and wind turbines which is the hottest sectors right now other than weed.  

I won't go into too much details because you but as of now the whole market is completely dominated by China and that's why Trump signed an executive order to bring REE supply chain back to domestic at all cost.   This will continue regardless of Biden or Trump because it is crucial for the development of the important industries as well as defense.  China has threatened to cut US off from these precious metals and has done so with Japan for disputes in 2010. 

As of now everything, I mean 100%, is sent back to China and it is refined and turned into alloys and oxides then sent back.   If America want to make EV and turbines domestically the demand is huge.   This is a EV long term play so get in early. 


Why MP?  There are so many REE companies out there? 

- MONOPOLY domestic play. Actually have a functional mine from bankruptcy before.  Now it is under new management and is actually functional unlike other companies.   If you know anything about mining you would know to get a mine functional would take 5 to 10 years not even counting infrastructure.    The REE price is so low to compete we won't be seeing any real competition soon because it is not cost effective to develop a mine. Most REE companies are just a dream where they suddenly wake up and get grants from DOD and everything just magically happens into a 10 bagger overnight.  Only other real non Chinese competitor is Lynas but they are ally Aussie owned. 

- MP is one of the world's biggest mine in the world

- 1 of 3 companies to receive grants from Pentagon.  9. 6 million for seperation capabilities enhancement

- Phase 2 of 170million to upgrade to produce oxides and magnets

- Investors include Chamath, omega advisors &amp; Slate path capital

- Third quarter revenue grew 52%; net income yoy increased 4x to 14. 6 million ,  adjusted EBITDA grew 159% yoy to 11. 6 million

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a new proposal on Tuesday, which could allow companies like Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), and DoorDash to compensate gig economy workers in equity.

What Happened: The regulator has proposed a pilot program for tech aggregators that hire gig economy workers or drivers, under which the companies can pay up to 15% of the worker compensation (not exceeding $75,000 in three years) in stock rather than cash.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,"Uber, Lyft, Doordash Can Pay Gig Workers Up To 15% Compensation in Stock Under New SEC proposal",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k0qn1k,False,dark,0.97,,public,1139,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1139,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1606333020.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"The question isn't \*when\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are &lt; 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

|\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|
|10|1,000%|Really, really low|
|20|500%|still really low|
|50|200%|you've had a few of these I bet|
|100|100%|MSFT hands these out in the long run|
|200|50%|doable|
|500|20%|Really, really doable|

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about compounding.** 

If you consistently re-invested your gains, you'd only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it's incredibly risky as you're assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding *looks* like.

**EDIT: A note about reality**

You're not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I'm not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you'll know **why** you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn't yet returned what it's capable of returning)

&amp;#x200B;",t2_pmw6,False,,0,False,WHY to exit a position vs. WHEN to exit a position.,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k19efy,False,dark,0.74,,public,25,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,25,,False,,1606406003.0,,[],{},,True,,1606398154.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn&amp;#39;t *when* you should get out, its &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; you should get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the goal isn&amp;#39;t 1 10x gain (though that&amp;#39;s pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are &amp;lt; 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you&amp;#39;re looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you&amp;#39;re looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s all this mean? Figure out where you&amp;#39;re trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could hope for 1 stock that you&amp;#39;re fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It&amp;#39;s luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that&amp;#39;s going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you&amp;#39;ll need to do this 500 times, but if you don&amp;#39;t think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you&amp;#39;ll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won&amp;#39;t see are the other two types of people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To put this all in perspective: Do you think you&amp;#39;d have an easier time of generating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 1 10,000% return or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- 500 20% returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It&amp;#39;s not easy at all. But then again, if that&amp;#39;s not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEGINNING INVESTMENT:&lt;/strong&gt; $10,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPECTED OUTCOME:&lt;/strong&gt; $1,000,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;500&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: A note about compounding.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you consistently re-invested your gains, you&amp;#39;d only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it&amp;#39;s incredibly risky as you&amp;#39;re assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like. &lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?

After more discussions,  Doug Marland , a 23-year-old comedian from  New Jersey , raised his hand to join a lawsuit objecting to the Trump administration's order to ban the app. Two others -- musician  Alec Chambers  and fashion designer Cosette Rinab -- also volunteered.

The three have a combined 7.4 million followers on TikTok and make their livings off the app. The suit argued that a ban would mean losing their income and limiting their ability to express themselves.

The lawsuit got little attention when it was filed in a  Pennsylvania  court. The TikTok stars ultimately prevailed -- and the case has become central in creating a path for the app to maintain its foothold in the U.S., where it is now used by almost one in three Americans.

It looked like a grass-roots effort, but it was not. Behind the scenes, the legal action was orchestrated by TikTok and its Chinese parent company,  ByteDance Ltd. , according to people familiar with the matter. It lined up the influencers to be plaintiffs, connected them with a top First Amendment lawyer and helped create a legal strategy that was complementary to a separate lawsuit the company pursued under its own name, the people said.

It was an unexpected twist in a geopolitical business saga that began this summer, and continues with a preliminary deal still under negotiation that involves  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  taking stakes in TikTok.

ByteDance and its potential U.S. partners are optimistic about completing a deal in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with their discussions and internal thinking. On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted ByteDance a one-week extension to complete a deal, putting the new deadline at  Dec. 4 .

In August, President Trump signed an order calling for TikTok to be shut down or, alternatively, sold to a U.S. company. The administration said it feared ByteDance could share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, which the company said it would never do.

The first ruling in TikTok's favor came with its own lawsuit, which argued that an initial  Commerce Department  ban on downloading or updating the app would harm the company's business. On  Sept. 27 , Judge  Carl Nichols  in the  U.S. District Court  in  Washington, D.C. , determined that the government likely overstepped its authority under national-security law. The government appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.

On  Oct. 30 , Judge  Wendy Beetlestone , in federal court for the  Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania , ruled on the influencer lawsuit. She blocked  Commerce Department  restrictions that would have barred U.S. companies from listing TikTok in their app stores -- a move that would effectively make it inoperable in the U.S.

""Without access to the TikTok app, Plaintiffs would lose access to all of these followers, as well as to the professional opportunities afforded by TikTok,"" Judge Beetlestone said in her decision.

The U.S. government has appealed the ruling. The government called the plaintiffs' claims meritless and argued their request to block the ban would "" necessarily infringe on the President's authority to block business-to-business economic transactions with a foreign entity in the midst of a declared national- security emergency.""

In a statement, TikTok's interim head,  Vanessa Pappas  said: ""We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to providing a home for them to do so.""

 One  of ByteDance's goals in recent months was to draw out the Trump administration's assault, the people said, betting that key officials would likely become increasingly distracted as the election approached.

The TikTok review by the administration began with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which evaluates deals for national security risks. That committee has ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations of TikTok, out of concern that user data could be shared with the Chinese government given regulations there that require companies to hand over huge swaths of information. ByteDance has said it would never share data with the Chinese government, though analysts and experts say companies generally have little choice but to comply if asked.

ByteDance's legal efforts were designed to chip away at the more punitive efforts by the Trump administration, even while it pursued a deal that would satisfy the Cfius order, which also has bipartisan support in  Washington . Any deal will ultimately require signoff from the U.S. president.

Although President-elect Biden has not made clear his position on TikTok, the committee's divestiture order would still likely stand under new administration.

For now, an outright ban of TikTok appears off the table: On  Nov. 12 , the  Commerce Department  said it wouldn't enforce the order that would have effectively forced TikTok to shut down, citing the ruling in the stars' lawsuit, and the administration's legal options are dwindling.

""It's a big muddle because of these lawsuits,"" said a senior administration official.

Ms. Rinab, a 21-year-old senior at the  University of Southern California , said she started crying when she learned of the court victory. ""I was so, so happy,"" she said.

""This entire experience has been one I'll never forget,"" said Mr. Marland. ""It taught me a lot about the country, the way laws work, and court procedures.""

While TikTok was aggressively pushing back on the proposed bans in the courts, it also pledged to work cooperatively with national-security regulators on the potential deal that would address the U.S. government's data-security concerns.

In mid-September, the company announced it had chosen  Oracle  as its partner to secure its data in the U.S., with the software giant and  Walmart Inc.  taking ownership stakes in a new company that would run TikTok's U.S. operations.

A key sticking point that still needs to be ironed out is the size of the ownership stakes for ByteDance and its new U.S. investors, according to people familiar with the discussions and internal thinking.

The negotiations have already helped  Walmart  forge closer ties to TikTok, something that has motivated the retailer from the beginning, according to people familiar with the situation.  Walmart  is working toward partnering with TikTok on providing warehouse and shipment support for sales made through the app, and  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon  now has relationships with TikTok's executive leadership, some of the people said.

Executives at  Oracle , who see TikTok as a major customer for its cloud business, expect the deal to be completed before the end of the year, a person close to the company said.

ByteDance kept its lawsuits against the U.S. government active in part to ensure that the app didn't face a shutdown as the negotiations took place.

Mr. Trump would still prefer to get rid of TikTok in the U.S. altogether, though his attention has shifted to other matters, the senior administration official said. The official said that even though Mr. Trump gave his preliminary approval to a deal, he has never been fully sold on the idea because he doesn't want a transaction that could be perceived as benefiting  China .

Inside the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin , Attorney General  William Barr  and  White House  economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  have all said in meetings at times that they believe a deal could work, while  White House  adviser and  China  hawk  Peter Navarro  has advised Mr. Trump to avoid a deal, according to the senior administration official.

TikTok believes it will still likely need to divest its American operations or face persistent questions about its handling of U.S. data, according to people familiar with the matter.

A deal must ultimately get signoff from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and Mr. Trump, as well as the Chinese government.

The lawsuit was designed in part to put a human face on TikTok. Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey's ""Without Me"" recorded in the basement studio at his parents' house earned him thousands of early followers.

Now more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

""TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don't have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business,"" he said. ""I felt like I needed to fight"" for TikTok.

Mr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.

As threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.

In September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,How Three TikTok Stars Beat Back U.S. Plans to Ban the App,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k1lmzt,False,dark,0.44,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606447611.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Without Me&amp;quot; recorded in the basement studio at his parents&amp;#39; house earned him thousands of early followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don&amp;#39;t have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I felt like I needed to fight&amp;quot; for TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022. 

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. 

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. 

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, 

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

Compared to the maybe outdated Ben Graham rule of price/earnings over 15 being expensive, a P/E of 8 seems like a bargain, unless I'm missing something important about the company or global insurance markets.

So what's the downside keeping the price so low?

The earnings return over time would be 6.12/47.76 = 13%, assuming they can just maintain their past performance, which to me doesn't seem unlikely.

I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers)) onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

**TL;DR** 

Amazing analytics software that makes the companies see connections between data that not been possible before, however issues with how many new customers they actually can earn going forward.",t2_8m6kj2f3,False,,0,False,Does Palantir have a scaling issue going forward?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k0sqty,False,dark,0.82,,public,81,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,81,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606341924.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it&amp;#39;s very hard to quit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE (&lt;a href=""https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers""&gt;https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers&lt;/a&gt;) onsight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don&amp;#39;t have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can&amp;#39;t just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It&amp;#39;s not scalable, it&amp;#39;s customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now from my understanding it&amp;#39;s actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can&amp;#39;t see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don&amp;#39;t think they can grow at an amazing pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The beleaguered U.S. labor market is absorbing a fresh wave of jobless workers, with 778,000 new unemployment claims filed in the latest week, as soaring COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths lead states and cities to clamp down on public life.

In comparison, Ford recalled 1.3 mil vehicles from 2014 to 2018 while selling 32.2 mil vehicles in the same time period. Fiat Chrysler also recalled 5.3 mil vehicles made between 2014 and 2018 while logging vehicle sales quantity of more than 400 mil over that period of time. Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/). This means an average of about 1-4% recall per new vehicle sale.

,investing,"I have around 7k USD in Tesla right now, which is basically all my savings, and as you all know it's been going up a lot since the announcement that they would be added to the S&amp;P list.

Yesterday I figured that this growth would probably continue for the rest of December, since they still need to actually be added to the list. So I thought it would be a good idea to open up a loan with my bank for about 3k and invest it into Tesla. Because you know, leverage!

I believed this could play out in 2 ways.

1. Either Tesla goes up a bunch in the next month and I can pay back my loan with basically 0% interest and let the rest of my profit sit in Tesla.
2. Tesla doesn't go up immediately, or maybe even dip down a bit, and I just let my loan sit there. I have 18 months to pay it back and if I do that then it'll cost me 200 USD interest. But I feel relatively confident that in those 18 months I'll have made more than 200 USD from rising Tesla stock.

But this morning when I woke up I thought, hmmm, what if the stock actually plummets when they get added to the S&amp;P list, because maybe that's the exact moment that a lot of people will think it's the best time to sell their Tesla stock to make some money. I'm a bit scared of that scenario. Even though maybe I have nothing to be afraid of if I just let my money sit there for the full 18 months.

\-Everyone knows ABNB is one of the biggest IPOs this year.

\-Everyone knows ABNB is a one of a kind unicorn, with massive growth potential, esp after pandemic.

\-Market conditions super bullish for 2021, institutions dumping their mountain of cash into stocks.

\-Every single public and private fund will want their hands on ABNB, at any price. no matter the fundamentals.

these are my thoughts, do you think it is a buy at ipo?

could it easily run up high well into 2021?

are you planning on buying or waiting?

thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: everyone here thinking about fundamentals and regulation issues. stop doing that particularly with this IPO and start thinking about:

1- disruptive

2- unicorn

&lt;p&gt;-Everyone knows ABNB is one of the biggest IPOs this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Everyone knows ABNB is a one of a kind unicorn, with massive growth potential, esp after pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Market conditions super bullish for 2021, institutions dumping their mountain of cash into stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Every single public and private fund will want their hands on ABNB, at any price. no matter the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these are my thoughts, do you think it is a buy at ipo?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;could it easily run up high well into 2021?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are you planning on buying or waiting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

The bulk of this sale spike may not have even materialized since many of the biggest gun buyers still expect Trump to stay in power, and also because discretionary spending has been impaired without a second round of stimulus and persistent unemployment. Another round of stimulus checks and a full concession by Trump will spur unprecedented gun sales. The market leaders, Smith &amp; Wesson (SWBI) and Ruger (RGR), are my picks because reasons but it doesn’t really matter since it’s an industry play. 

For the longer term, will Biden have the political ability, or time, to take on the gun industry? Probably not. He will piss people off whether he takes a strong stance on guns or not, but with Trump gearing up for a 2024 run, Biden has more to lose politically by pissing off gun loving conservatives than progressives who will vote for him in 2024 no matter what. 

With cannabis, Joe has a political layup at his disposal. Expect further legalization of marijuana in the very near future. NIC Inc. (EGOV) is my personal favorite but like guns it’s an industry play so the others should also fare well.

The market leaders, Smith &amp;amp; Wesson (SWBI) and Ruger (RGR), are my picks because reasons but it doesn’t really matter since it’s an industry play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longer term, will Biden have the political ability, or time, to take on the gun industry? Probably not. He will piss people off whether he takes a strong stance on guns or not, but with Trump gearing up for a 2024 run, Biden has more to lose politically by pissing off gun loving conservatives than progressives who will vote for him in 2024 no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With cannabis, Joe has a political layup at his disposal. Expect further legalization of marijuana in the very near future. NIC Inc. (EGOV) is my personal favorite but like guns it’s an industry play so the others should also fare well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all in on EGOV &amp;amp; SWBI in the Roth&lt;/p&gt;

Dividend yield is currently at around 5% annual. Non-GAAP PE is at 11.52 (but GAAP EPS is negative for the last year). Hit the bottom at 19.99 back in March and is up 50% since then at around 33.

,investing,"Square has been a hot stock in recent months.  The 317x trailing earnings is a fair point.  Would love to hear opinions on why this guy is right and why he is wrong.

What happened
Shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock surged 4.9% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as of 1:40 p.m. EST, after the company announced it has reached a ""definitive agreement"" to acquire the Credit Karma Tax unit of consumer credit report provider Credit Karma.

So what
Square will acquire the free tax-filing service and add it to its own Cash App subsidiary in a deal valued at $50 million, cash. In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition ""will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket.""  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.

This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I&amp;#39;d be more inclined to use today&amp;#39;s share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi community!

Have been thinking about this for some time now. Thought r/investing might also be interested to brainstorm with me on this. I try to keep it short and simple.

\- So current thesis is, that as Tesla will be included in SP500 in December, the price of stock will keep on rising from the buying pressure of index funds that must include the stock.

\- Back in September, decision not to include Tesla, caused more than 30% sell off (although there were other reasons for more than 30% retracement, such as market wide sell-off etc.).

Now lets make few assumptions and **please not let argue about those**, because i would rather love to see some theories on the subject i am about to propose. The assumptions are as follows:

\- Tesla stock price is in a bubble.

\- Decision committee that decides on inclusion, is not stupid.

\- Fund managers + committee and other parties involved talk to each other, are not stupid either.

\- Before mainstream and retail is informed, fund managers get the information somewhat earlier (lets please not argue about the legal aspects of this assumption).

Now what i am thinking, funds would like to avoid buying an asset with inflated value and would prefer to have as low entry point as possible. Now i am thinking, if i was party involved in either the decision making of inclusion and/or fund manager, what would my game plan be in October and at the start of November. 

So what i came up with as my best guess. My best game strategy would be to in this instance to purchase significant amount of \~monthly call options around the strike price of $500, knowing that once the information is made public, those call options would bring in a very nice profit and would help to significantly lower my entry price. Now somewhere around now, as price keeps steadily increasing, i would buy montly put options with a strike price around $400. And in a week or two, once i have enough, as pre accepted strategy with committee, i would make a public statement about ""some ongoing research into SP inclusion and therefore until further notice, Tesla will not be included"". Share price would plummet significantly and i would again make a nice 10x for example, on my put options. Now with the profits from both calls and those calls further invested into puts, i have more than enough profits, to now either purchase directly or exercise the options to have far more reasonable entry price for the stock. In a small cap entry, i would not even think (much) about such theory, but Tesla is currently just about to take worlds 9th place by market cap and its weight and effect on funds and SP500 is significant. Tin foil hat off.

So community, what do you think about my strategy/thesis as a theoretical commitee/fund manager member and what are your thoughts about commitee and fund managers going through October and November, knowing very well, that if by doing anything by the rules, they would need to buy into very inflated asset and overall, inclusion decision at current time would not be the smartest decision. Do you think they even care or need to care on these matters? Maybe they wont and that would make my whole point invalid.

I would be very interested in your thoughts on this matter. And please again, lets try not discuss and argue about those 4 assumptions i made above.

&lt;p&gt;Analysts at PVM oil brokerage in London said that traders were increasingly treating the prospect of vaccines as a “game changer” for the energy sector, though prices still remain well below the near $70 a barrel they traded at before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hello all,

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

---

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM. 

1. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
2. Li Auto ($LI)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&amp;P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the ""old boys club"" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. 

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Nio Inc ($NIO)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
5. Li Auto ($LI)

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)
2. General Motors ($GM)
3. Li Auto ($LI)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard 

---

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

- - -

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!

Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&amp;amp;P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the &amp;quot;old boys club&amp;quot; of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png""&gt;Margins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margins are one of the best ways to value a company&amp;#39;s operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png""&gt;Liquidity Multiples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png""&gt;Leverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don&amp;#39;t think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png""&gt;Institutional Ownership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM&amp;#39;s EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla&amp;#39;s lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc""&gt;Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone&amp;#39;s concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png""&gt;Supply Chain Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don&amp;#39;t regret it, however I don&amp;#39;t look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I&amp;#39;m currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

What does the community think about investment in carbon credits? 

In the coming period, as governments crackdown on greenhouse gas production, they will need companies to be net carbon neutral. As the companies strive to reduce the carbon production, they will have a period of needing to purchase carbon credits to offset the current levels of production.

In this realm lays the carbon credits. To offset the current levels of games produced, they buy carbon credits.

Now I'm not sure how consumers/traders can invest in carbon credits. There is one ETF that i found KRBN which allows such.

&lt;li&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive significant other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?&lt;/li&gt;

Hello  everyone, just wanna give you the heads up that I am fairly new to  this. I make my own DD before investing in a company but I have no way  to know if my DD is good until after the fact. So, I had this idea of  posting it here and the community can discuss the ticker and my DD. I am  hoping that I you guys can pick-up on any mistakes that I am not aware  of.

All the data was collected from MarketWatch, SeekingAlpha and YahooFinance.

So, Element Solutions (**$ESI**)  is a specialty chemicals production corporation formerly known as   Platform Specialty Products Corporation (changed the name in 2019). They  own several business brands: MacDermid, Compugraphics, Fernox, alpha  and Kester.

The company does business all over the world (EUA, South America, Europe, Asia) and has reach to a many key markets:

* Automotive
* Computing &amp; Telecom
* Consumer Goods
* Energy &amp; Resources
* Military, Aerospacial &amp; Medical
* Mobile &amp; Wearables
* Printed Packing
* Water Treatment

I won't go over them in detail, just a few key point:

**Automotive**

According to their website, their automotive initiative ESI:Automotive includes **EV/Powertrain**, **Safety systems (ADAS)**, Lightweight, Interior and Exterior.

Their EV/Powertrain business is directed at Battery management systems and inverter solutions.

The Safety systems (ADAS) include sensors, cameras, **Lidar**, central computer and conectivity.

The remaining divisions are mainly for improved materials, displays, touchscreens, etc.

Also according to them the ESI:automotive has **more than 1400 active patents**.

**Computing &amp; Telecom**

They throw a lot of big words around: Big data, AI, 5G... but **at the end of the day they supply the materials** to build and operate those systems. Which is fine.

""Specifically developed materials that are utilized in many of the  highest technology processors today.""

""High-performance assembly  materials and solders are the conduit of electronic functionality.""

**Consumer Goods**

As more to do with **aesthetic** and surface solutions, coatings, etc.

**Energy &amp; Resources**

They deal with oil companies and **solar** companies.

""The  offshore oil industry uses our control fluids to effectively and   safely recover oil from the deepest depths. The photovoltaics industry   utilizes our chemicals and materials to conduct new electrons as soon as   they are created within solar cells.""

**Military, Aerospacial &amp; Medical**

Coatings/shock  absorbers for airplanes, circuit metallization and high integrity  solders connections for military aplications, semiconductor packaging  methods for circuits in medical imaging devices and chemicals that form  the circuity of medical eletronics.

**Mobile &amp; Wearebles**

""Our printed electronics initiative is helping companies to explore the  **printed electronics market**  with our combined product and application  experience spanning circuit  metallization, assembly and soldering,  precision coated films, and  printed graphics. We represent a strong and  organized front in this new  and exciting industry, and are looking  forward to shaping its  development in the decades to come.""

Again they throw around big words like 5G, Cloud, streaming,  extended battery life, etc...

**Printed Packaging**

This area is all about printing those nice, vibrant and appealing packages that catch your eye at the supermarket.

""In the graphics packaging industry, we are a leader in innovation. With **global patents and trademarks**,  our research and development drives  flexographic printing forward.  Printers turn to us to ensure the  expectations and demands of brand  owners are met for every print job  they deliver.""

**Water treatment**

**Manufacture and supply of chemical and filter technology** to diagnose, treat  and protect domestic and commercial heating systems in **markets across  the globe**.

""Many  of our products are award winning and are accredited with  independent  approvals for their energy efficient and environmentally  friendly  credentials.""

All  in all, this seems like a company that has their fingers in a lot of  markets. Some are still growing (EV, Solar energy, semiconductors) and  other are more well established (Water treatment, printing packages,  Medical) which in my opinion gives them the oportunity to grow and have a  nice fail safe cushen if things go south.

**The numbers**

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|2018|2019|TTM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|1,96 B|1,84 B|1,78 B|
|Net Income|(81,5) M|78,9 M|121,2 M|
|EBITDA|411,5 M|400,5 M|390,4 M|

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Cap:** 3.34 B             //                              **Free Cash Flow (2019):** 100.7 M

**P/E:** 29.39

**EPS:** 0.48

All  in all, I like these numbers. There might be no substancial growth  going on right now, but as the company pointed out in their last  earnings, COVID took a tool on their clients, and business has not  increased as expected. Nontheless they managed to increase their Net  Income (TTM) and maintin a health EBITDA.

At  the end of the day I am feeling good about the news and the direction  that this company is going. They are not going for crazy volatility or  turbulence, but rather steady growth and taking their investors with  them to the top. I have dedicated them around 10% of my portfolio to  Element Solutions.

&lt;p&gt;At  the end of the day I am feeling good about the news and the direction  that this company is going. They are not going for crazy volatility or  turbulence, but rather steady growth and taking their investors with  them to the top. I have dedicated them around 10% of my portfolio to  Element Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi everyone!

This is going to be my first post, I feel it's necessary because I'm in a bit of a tricky situation regarding the purchase of shares of a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company).

I've been bagholding shares of GMHI (Gores Metropolous Inc, the SPAC) for a while now. The proposed merger will bring Luminar (a private company pursuing to take a shot at a (large) piece of the global market share on LIDAR-technology for autonomous vehicles) public under a new Tickr 'LAZR'. 

My question is the following: The proposed merger has a fixed valuation before (attempting) to going public, and they are issuing shares to the public and keeping some shares private. To my knowledge, this would mean they have a fixed share price when the merger goes through (Approx. 10 USD/Share if I'm not mistaken).

However, the SPAC is trading +- 36% higher than this at the moment. The company has stated that all outstanding shares of GMHI will be turned into a 1:1 equivalent amount of shares for LAZR. **If the merger goes through, does this mean that when the original TICKR (GMHI) turns into LAZR, the value of the shares would possibly decrease to 10 USD/Share (even though I bought in at 12.5USD/Share of GMHI)?** 

Or does the market value of the GMHI shares carry over to the new TICKR? 

To me it's obviously important whether or not I should sell my shares pre-merger to buy in at a lower price point, or will market sentiment 'most likely' correct the new share price of LAZR?

,investing,"Hi there,

Hope everyone is doing okay today. I've been watching markets for years and have definitely been in tune with 2020's various twists and turns for investors. I usually conduct several hours of research before even considering investing in a stock. My usual strategy involves sticking with businesses I understand and staying away from investments I feel are clearly overpriced.

In this market, I'm noticing that certain meme stocks are king. Plug Power, Tesla, Jumia Technologies, Nikola (previously), and others have run far away from a level where many investors are comfortable making a purchase. I've also noticed that the returns of several friends and family members are absolutely trouncing the rest of the market. These individuals often conduct less than one hour of research and barely know the P/E, P/S, or business model of the stock they are trading.

Are there risks in these markets? Have we shifted to a new paradigm where everybody should just buy TSLA, PLUG etc. and just coast to retirement in 5 years? If this can continue, surely you would think that pension funds would toss those 2% bonds in the garbage and buy such securities.

&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone is doing okay today. I&amp;#39;ve been watching markets for years and have definitely been in tune with 2020&amp;#39;s various twists and turns for investors. I usually conduct several hours of research before even considering investing in a stock. My usual strategy involves sticking with businesses I understand and staying away from investments I feel are clearly overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this market, I&amp;#39;m noticing that certain meme stocks are king. Plug Power, Tesla, Jumia Technologies, Nikola (previously), and others have run far away from a level where many investors are comfortable making a purchase. I&amp;#39;ve also noticed that the returns of several friends and family members are absolutely trouncing the rest of the market. These individuals often conduct less than one hour of research and barely know the P/E, P/S, or business model of the stock they are trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there risks in these markets? Have we shifted to a new paradigm where everybody should just buy TSLA, PLUG etc. and just coast to retirement in 5 years? If this can continue, surely you would think that pension funds would toss those 2% bonds in the garbage and buy such securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong on any of the above, I&amp;#39;m curious about people&amp;#39;s thoughts here. Thank you and have a great holiday week.&lt;/p&gt;

$9B, and it’s still not done???

That means the company has to be at least $180B in size, otherwise SECs 5% ownership rule would kick in(although it could receive special exemption).

Since BRK.B is not done yet, we can assume it’s a very big fish with a very large float, otherwise that stock could likely go vertical due to lack of supply of shares.

There are not many companies that fit this bill, which company could it be?

Some people are thinking it’s TSLA but I am kind of doubtful. In the same time, there's cause for suspicion, as huge TSLA shares have been out of trading action and Buffet himself shot the possibility of investing in TSLA in an Yahoo Finance interview(which gives more flame to the fire, since Buffet has a history of being tight lipped and saying the opposite of what he actually does).

I bought 50 shares of Corsair at $17.45, then another 227 between that and $30.It accrues for roughly 60% of my individual stocks in my portfolio, with the rest being somewhat diverse.

My question to you is - would you sell now if you were to gain 74%? I originally planned on selling at $40, but the way it keeps rising, I was thinking of holding until $50 then selling 50-75%. This is my first IPO that hasn't bit me in the ass, and I am quite pleased with the result. 

The company is solid, holidays are on the way, it is THE gamer/streamer company which every kid wants to do nowadays, so I think the ""normal"" price will be between $50-60 when it finally settles down. Logitech will probably remain worth more, but people spend stupid amounts of money on RGB (like me) and capture cards.

I know you can't time the market, but I thought it was odd there hasn't been a recent discussion on why it's popping. If there was one, I can't find it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&amp;#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|
|2011|204|74.36%|
|2012|413|102.45|
|2013|2,013|387.41|
|2014|3,198|58.87|
|2015|4,046|26.52|
|2016|7,000|73.01|
|2017|11,759|67.99|
|2018|21,461|82.51|
|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&amp;#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&amp;#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&amp;#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&amp;#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&amp;#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&amp;#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&amp;#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&amp;pkey=S1dbei4)

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&amp;#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&amp;#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&amp;#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&amp;#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|160,000|200,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&amp;#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a &gt; 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",t2_2azvb7oz,False,,0,False,The Tesla Bull Case in Brief,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jzhwhf,False,dark,0.82,,public,113,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,113,,True,,1606142785.0,,[],{},,True,,1606168112.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There&amp;#39;s reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at Tesla&amp;#39;s Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Revenue (USD Millions)&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;30,626&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;24.61&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;44,937&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;46.73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2022&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;55,963&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;24.54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;79,620&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;42.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2024&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;102,526&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;28.77&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock""&gt;Source (Markets Insider)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla&amp;#39;s growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem optimistic, but you&amp;#39;re welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e""&gt;any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions""&gt;Source (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, &lt;a href=""https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:%7E:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030""&gt;the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030&lt;/a&gt; (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. &lt;a href=""https://www.ev-volumes.com/""&gt;EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY&lt;/a&gt;. Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla&amp;#39;s growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn&amp;#39;t large enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an optimist, I&amp;#39;m fine betting on Tesla&amp;#39;s ability to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm""&gt;their 10Q filing&lt;/a&gt; this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla&amp;#39;s profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d""&gt;This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla&amp;#39;s past four quarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22""&gt;Source (Tesla Investor Relations)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing Efficiencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing Efficiencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla&amp;#39;s capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b""&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://hypercharts.co/tsla""&gt;Source (Hypercharts)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b""&gt;Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/""&gt;Source (Statista)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124""&gt;t Tesla&amp;#39;s battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&amp;amp;pkey=S1dbei4""&gt;Source (Tesla Investor Relations)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla is forecasting a &lt;strong&gt;69%!!!&lt;/strong&gt; increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as &lt;strong&gt;56%&lt;/strong&gt;. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla&amp;#39;s margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to &lt;a href=""https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/""&gt;Wright&amp;#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn&amp;#39;t pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla&amp;#39;s improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn&amp;#39;t part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla&amp;#39;s fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s existing products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Self Driving: $10,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t currently available was previously an option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acceleration Boosts

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 3: $2,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model Y: $2,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscriptions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premium Connectivity: $10/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Self Driving: ???

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reportedly coming soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supercharging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as &amp;quot;the internet of cars&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla&amp;#39;s revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it&amp;#39;s not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there&amp;#39;s reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla&amp;#39;s revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla&amp;#39;s profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll cover some other businesses of Tesla&amp;#39;s that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aforementioned Network Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ridesharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla&amp;#39;s battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9""&gt;Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift""&gt;Source (Financial Times)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla&amp;#39;s energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla&amp;#39;s targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A refresher on Tesla Energy&amp;#39;s available products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar Roof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery Storage

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Wall (residential)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Pack (commercial)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mega Pack (utility scale)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ridesharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla&amp;#39;s autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla&amp;#39;s warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn&amp;#39;t be available to customers of other insurance providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Expectations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public accountability purposes, I&amp;#39;ll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I&amp;#39;m not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I&amp;#39;ll keep it pretty simple. I&amp;#39;ll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vehicle deliveries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;25%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;75%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020 Deliveries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;160,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020 Revenue (USD millions)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;30,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;36,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021 Deliveries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;800,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1,200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021 Revenue (USD millions)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;48,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;78,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2025 Deliveries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2025 Revenue (USD millions)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;135,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;350,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a""&gt;(I&amp;#39;ve said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a &amp;gt; 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are dubious regarding Tesla&amp;#39;s ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla&amp;#39;s ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it&amp;#39;s a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I&amp;#39;m willing to bet that they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I&amp;#39;m sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I&amp;#39;d expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi everyone, I hope this post is OK to post here but just wanted to put my thoughts down in a thread and see if anyone can give their insight/opinion as to whether my thinking is as simple as this. I am aware many outcomes can come from the current climate, none of which can be predicted, but I am looking for your thoughts based on the next 18 months going as such:

(note: I am from the UK, but I think it applies similarly to US/EU investment too)

January 2021-June 2021: Vaccination of Elderly   
June 2021-Dec 2021: Vaccination of second/third ""at risk""   
Jan 2022-June 2022: Back to ""Normal"" (vaccinations required)

**At the moment** I see a couple investments as very attractive. Recovery stocks in the short term and Gold/Silver in the middle term. Long term is too far away for me to consider right now. My thinking is that recovery stocks (mostly travel related) are very underpriced right now. I'm up 10% just this week from them and most of them will have to increase by 300-500% to get back to pre-pandemic levels. My thinking is that once vaccination becomes a reality, all the pent up demand for airlines/cruises and the like will surge these stocks to (or given stocks can be hype-fuelled) or further than their pre-pandemic levels. I personally am pushing for many over 50s cruise lines as I expect them to be the first to re-open given the first phase of vaccination is of that demographic. I expect stocks to soar in travel in 2021, but would be intrigued to hear all your opinions on this. I also personally think property may be a good options mid 2021 in the UK as IR's will still be very low and the bubble will have popped by April 2021 (no explanation needed there lol)

Now, I think what's next? I read last week that UK banks are experiencing record high levels of savings. People aren't spending as much as they were. The problems with the travel industry is they have reduced capital, grounded so many planes and logistically it will be a nightmare to match even pre-pandemic demand. Their supply is going to be drastically cut shorter, but demand will be massively higher. I think people will justify paying more than they were used to out of desperation and their savings account balance justifying it. What does this do? Increases prices and surges inflation. This is good for the government as they don't have to increase taxes as much given the debt proportionately decreases and it's good for those companies as they can recover quicker. It's not good for the average person who has a savings account still at the 0.5% interest rate. Yes, eventually the gov will raise IR's when inflation becomes unstable, but until then, what do we do as investors? That's where I'm going to position into gold (and a bit of silver).. at LEAST until IR's come up. 

My strategy to conclude is as follows:

**Short Term:** Recovery stocks (very under-priced)  
**Short/Mid Term:** Property (IR Low / Prices Low)   
**Mid - Term:** Gold (Inflation)

With the rumors of bankruptcy of Danke Apartments(DNK) and continuous defaults by Ziroom Apartments, how long can Long Term Rental apartments survive?

I couldn't bear to read the rumors about Danke Apartments declaring bankruptcy and frequent defaults of Long Term Rental Apartments, so I decided to write another article.

It is true that for young people who are new to Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), they cannot afford to pay rent on a quarterly or yearly basis. Long Term Rental apartments, which charge monthly fees and are simply furnished, are supposed to be a good business.

However, over the past few years, more than 60 Long Term Rental apartment companies have defaulted, and a variety of shortcomings have emerged, such as paying high prices acquiring apartments, renting them at low prices, then the executives flee to foreign countries with the money, defaulting on rent payments to landlords, giving tenants arbitrary price hikes, and charging high service fees .......

At present, among the remaining leading enterprises, such as Ziroom Apartments claims to have 500,000 landlords and 3 million customers, and Danke Apartments claims to have 400,000 rooms and has served 1 million customers. With such a huge number of properties and customers, why is it that suddenly the liquidity is strained and the company has been reported to be going out of business?

In fact, many readers are not aware of the financial model of Long Term Rental apartments.

The Financial Model of Long Term Rental Apartments

Whether it's a Danke apartment or another Long Term Rental apartment, they all have the same basic routine.

The first step is to find a landlord who will waive one month's rent to cover the renovations needed for a Long Term Rental.

The second step is to find a tenant to rent the apartment, and there are usually several options for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual payments. The tenant will usually be asked to choose the monthly payment because it gives a certain cash bonus.

And therein lies the catch. If the tenant chooses to pay monthly, he or she must apply for a ""rent credit"" with a finance company. Long-term rental apartments will generally lure tenants into signing a one-year lease by reducing the rent by hundreds of yuan in various ways, so that the tenant can get a loan from the finance company for a total of 11 months' rent, which will be credited to the long-term rental apartment's account at once.

The tenant pays one month's rent up front, with a one-month security deposit, and then pays the rent once a month. Ostensibly, the tenant does not have to pay the interest on the rental loan and only has to pay the monthly rent according to the negotiated rent.

For example, if an apartment costs the landlord 3,000 yuan per month to rent, he rents it to the tenant for 3,600 yuan per month.

At the same time, the tenant pays an 8% management fee of $240 per month. In total, the long term tenant will receive $3,840/month.

In fact, the tenant is renting the apartment at an interest rate of 28%. This is also a disguised usury that raises the price of the rent.

The third step is that the tenant loan goes into the pocket of the Long Term Rental apartment in one lump sum, and they take this prepaid rent to continue renting, renovating the apartment, and running the company.

Their profitability lies in the difference in rent, as well as the difference in interest.

So if they are managing hundreds of thousands of apartments, why are they running out of money on their books?

There are two reasons for this.

The first one is that they expand like crazy. When they get a rental loan, they immediately jump into the market to grab another property. Once they get the property, they don't rent it out immediately, and they lose the free time in between.

These rent payments to landlords take up a lot of money.

The second is the cost of renovation. Usually when they get a house, they will renovate it first. If the cost of renovating one room is 50,000 yuan, the capital occupied by 400,000 rooms will be as high as 20 billion yuan.

This is an astronomical figure, so while the revenue of long-term rental apartments continues to grow, the amount of losses also continues to expand.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019, Danke Apartments suffered net losses of 272 million yuan (657 million in revenue), 1.370 billion yuan (2.675 billion in revenue) and 2.516 billion yuan (5.712 billion in revenue), respectively. In the past three years, the net loss exceeded 4 billion yuan.

In order to be profitable, long-term rental apartments must be able to continue to operate most of the renovated properties after recovering the costs of renovation.

In the event of a large-scale landlord surrender, or a tenant surrender, the Long Term Rental apartment's financial chain will break (they run out of capital).

This is because if the landlord surrenders the lease, the cost of renovation will not be amortized and will become a loss.

If the tenant surrenders the lease early, the Long Term Rental apartment needs to repay the loan and interest from financial institutions.

At present, the share of rental loans in the revenue of Danke Apartments and other long-term rental apartments is over 60%. 2019, the debt ratio of Danke Apartments apartments is over 100%.

In other words, the debt ratio of these long-term rental apartments has surpassed that of real estate developers, who are essentially dancing on financial leverage.

Since 2019, nearly 60 Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt due to financial breakdowns and mismanagement. After the explosion of a number of parent-rental apartment institutions, many places in China also explicitly issued a letter to stop ""rent loans"".

In December 2019, the Opinions on Rectifying and Regulating the Housing Leasing Market Order were issued, which included rent and deposits into the regulatory accounts. The Opinions require that the rental income of housing rental enterprises shall not exceed 30% of the amount of housing rental loans, exceeding the proportion shall be adjusted in place by the end of 2022.

This means that all Long Term Rental apartments such as Danke Apartments and Ziroom Apartments must reduce their rental loan ratio, which also means that the loan funds they rely on for survival and expansion will be greatly reduced.

If there is no capital transfusion, the financial chain may break at any time. This is the main reason why so many Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt.

Long Term Rental apartments are suitable for young people in big cities, but the innovation of this model has no technical content, and the main threshold is capital.

For example, the investors of Danke Apartments are Tiger Global Fund, Pleasure Capital, Kaiwu Investment, CMC Capital, and Chunhua Capital, which hold 20.0%, 15.7%, 10.4%, 9.4%, and 6.9% of the shares respectively, and Ant Financial also holds 7.8% of it's shares.

Those long-lease apartments without wealthy and generous investors are almost dead.

But no matter how good an investor is, it's hard to hold on for long when faced with a venture that continues to fail to see a profit.

The mandatory requirement of ""within 30% of the rental loan ratio"" will put an end to the wild growth of Long Term Rental apartments. It is necessary to think about how to make legitimate profits in business, not just to make a large scale, monopolize the number of houses, and then play the Internet game of harvesting after autumn.

Didi (Chinese Uber) ended up playing the monopoly, and failed to do the harvesting after becoming a monopoly. What's more, the long lease apartment is even heavier than Didi's model, dancing on the financial bubble.

Before the end of 2022, more and more Long Term Rental apartments will definitely go bankrupt and the executives would flee to foreign countries. Therefore, both landlords and tenants need to keep their eyes peeled, look carefully at the leasing contract and loan contract, and say no to all the overbearing clauses.

At the same time, in the trillion-yuan rental market, long-term rental apartments are a product needed by young people, but a better system is needed to regulate them, rather than letting them fall into this high-leverage financial game.

The status quo not only raises rents and the burden of renting for young people, but also adds a huge financial risk to society.

&lt;p&gt;With the rumors of bankruptcy of Danke Apartments(DNK) and continuous defaults by Ziroom Apartments, how long can Long Term Rental apartments survive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t bear to read the rumors about Danke Apartments declaring bankruptcy and frequent defaults of Long Term Rental Apartments, so I decided to write another article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that for young people who are new to Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), they cannot afford to pay rent on a quarterly or yearly basis. Long Term Rental apartments, which charge monthly fees and are simply furnished, are supposed to be a good business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, over the past few years, more than 60 Long Term Rental apartment companies have defaulted, and a variety of shortcomings have emerged, such as paying high prices acquiring apartments, renting them at low prices, then the executives flee to foreign countries with the money, defaulting on rent payments to landlords, giving tenants arbitrary price hikes, and charging high service fees .......&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, among the remaining leading enterprises, such as Ziroom Apartments claims to have 500,000 landlords and 3 million customers, and Danke Apartments claims to have 400,000 rooms and has served 1 million customers. With such a huge number of properties and customers, why is it that suddenly the liquidity is strained and the company has been reported to be going out of business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many readers are not aware of the financial model of Long Term Rental apartments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Financial Model of Long Term Rental Apartments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;#39;s a Danke apartment or another Long Term Rental apartment, they all have the same basic routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to find a landlord who will waive one month&amp;#39;s rent to cover the renovations needed for a Long Term Rental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is to find a tenant to rent the apartment, and there are usually several options for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual payments. The tenant will usually be asked to choose the monthly payment because it gives a certain cash bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And therein lies the catch. If the tenant chooses to pay monthly, he or she must apply for a &amp;quot;rent credit&amp;quot; with a finance company. Long-term rental apartments will generally lure tenants into signing a one-year lease by reducing the rent by hundreds of yuan in various ways, so that the tenant can get a loan from the finance company for a total of 11 months&amp;#39; rent, which will be credited to the long-term rental apartment&amp;#39;s account at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tenant pays one month&amp;#39;s rent up front, with a one-month security deposit, and then pays the rent once a month. Ostensibly, the tenant does not have to pay the interest on the rental loan and only has to pay the monthly rent according to the negotiated rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if an apartment costs the landlord 3,000 yuan per month to rent, he rents it to the tenant for 3,600 yuan per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the tenant pays an 8% management fee of $240 per month. In total, the long term tenant will receive $3,840/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the tenant is renting the apartment at an interest rate of 28%. This is also a disguised usury that raises the price of the rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third step is that the tenant loan goes into the pocket of the Long Term Rental apartment in one lump sum, and they take this prepaid rent to continue renting, renovating the apartment, and running the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their profitability lies in the difference in rent, as well as the difference in interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if they are managing hundreds of thousands of apartments, why are they running out of money on their books?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is that they expand like crazy. When they get a rental loan, they immediately jump into the market to grab another property. Once they get the property, they don&amp;#39;t rent it out immediately, and they lose the free time in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rent payments to landlords take up a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is the cost of renovation. Usually when they get a house, they will renovate it first. If the cost of renovating one room is 50,000 yuan, the capital occupied by 400,000 rooms will be as high as 20 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an astronomical figure, so while the revenue of long-term rental apartments continues to grow, the amount of losses also continues to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the first three quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019, Danke Apartments suffered net losses of 272 million yuan (657 million in revenue), 1.370 billion yuan (2.675 billion in revenue) and 2.516 billion yuan (5.712 billion in revenue), respectively. In the past three years, the net loss exceeded 4 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be profitable, long-term rental apartments must be able to continue to operate most of the renovated properties after recovering the costs of renovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of a large-scale landlord surrender, or a tenant surrender, the Long Term Rental apartment&amp;#39;s financial chain will break (they run out of capital).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because if the landlord surrenders the lease, the cost of renovation will not be amortized and will become a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the tenant surrenders the lease early, the Long Term Rental apartment needs to repay the loan and interest from financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the share of rental loans in the revenue of Danke Apartments and other long-term rental apartments is over 60%. 2019, the debt ratio of Danke Apartments apartments is over 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the debt ratio of these long-term rental apartments has surpassed that of real estate developers, who are essentially dancing on financial leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, nearly 60 Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt due to financial breakdowns and mismanagement. After the explosion of a number of parent-rental apartment institutions, many places in China also explicitly issued a letter to stop &amp;quot;rent loans&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2019, the Opinions on Rectifying and Regulating the Housing Leasing Market Order were issued, which included rent and deposits into the regulatory accounts. The Opinions require that the rental income of housing rental enterprises shall not exceed 30% of the amount of housing rental loans, exceeding the proportion shall be adjusted in place by the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that all Long Term Rental apartments such as Danke Apartments and Ziroom Apartments must reduce their rental loan ratio, which also means that the loan funds they rely on for survival and expansion will be greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is no capital transfusion, the financial chain may break at any time. This is the main reason why so many Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long Term Rental apartments are suitable for young people in big cities, but the innovation of this model has no technical content, and the main threshold is capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the investors of Danke Apartments are Tiger Global Fund, Pleasure Capital, Kaiwu Investment, CMC Capital, and Chunhua Capital, which hold 20.0%, 15.7%, 10.4%, 9.4%, and 6.9% of the shares respectively, and Ant Financial also holds 7.8% of it&amp;#39;s shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those long-lease apartments without wealthy and generous investors are almost dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how good an investor is, it&amp;#39;s hard to hold on for long when faced with a venture that continues to fail to see a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mandatory requirement of &amp;quot;within 30% of the rental loan ratio&amp;quot; will put an end to the wild growth of Long Term Rental apartments. It is necessary to think about how to make legitimate profits in business, not just to make a large scale, monopolize the number of houses, and then play the Internet game of harvesting after autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi (Chinese Uber) ended up playing the monopoly, and failed to do the harvesting after becoming a monopoly. What&amp;#39;s more, the long lease apartment is even heavier than Didi&amp;#39;s model, dancing on the financial bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the end of 2022, more and more Long Term Rental apartments will definitely go bankrupt and the executives would flee to foreign countries. Therefore, both landlords and tenants need to keep their eyes peeled, look carefully at the leasing contract and loan contract, and say no to all the overbearing clauses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in the trillion-yuan rental market, long-term rental apartments are a product needed by young people, but a better system is needed to regulate them, rather than letting them fall into this high-leverage financial game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo not only raises rents and the burden of renting for young people, but also adds a huge financial risk to society.&lt;/p&gt;

from buying the dip to surfing the tech surge with options, an investor following the Robinhood crowd this year would have a lot to feel good about.

Provided they didn’t follow too long, that is.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest [academic research ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077)into retail investing.

 When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. 

 

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.

“Robinhood users are more subject to attention biases,” wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. “The combination of naïve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.”

Robinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime) amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.

As retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood’s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there’s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.

It’s familiar territory for two of the paper’s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf) a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

Okay everyone knows this. Too many people buying something that's limited in quantity will push it's price up. No biggie.

2. No real increase in disposable income.
This seems to be a really big problem. It's not like people have gotten richer or have a bigger pay check now. This means that people are saving money and investing that.

Why is that a concern?

Because if so many people are cutting down on expenses to invest the surplus, consumerism will go down.

,investing,"Hi. It seems the most important benefit of investing in private real estate is the potential to use **leverage** to boost both capital appreciation and yield. Provided there is enough net yield to cover interest and mortgage payments, eventually, as you start paying off the debt, you could achieve a pretty strong return. Assuming a 2% growth rate in the capital value, with a 20% deposit you are leveraging at 5X. If you were to maintain this LTV ratio of 80%, you'd basically be getting 10% IRR excluding interest expenses/yield. Of course, if the yield increases or you can produce a net yield after interest, you are getting some uplift there too. It wouldn't be inconceivable to manage 20% IRR.

Stocks might net 5-7% per annum (without making any significant, optimistic assumptions). Using leverage with stocks is generally ill-advised as even 2X ""LTV"" could/would get you margin-called in a recessionary crash (e.g. Q1 2020).

&lt;p&gt;Like what exactly are they doing with this money that can generate that much returns when developed world is near 0% or negative interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I recently ran into the problem of deciding how to split money into different assets (more specifically stocks and bonds). The idea is that the investment size should be a function of the probabilities of receiving the cash flows, and the cash flows themselves. For a company this could be the future free cash flows, and for a bond it would be the future coupons.

My first attempt was assuming one would either lose all their money, or make a specific profit. I tried multiplying each expected profit with the probability of me getting it (implying that the probability of total loss is 1 - P(profit)), and then doing the same for all other investment opportunities. Consequently, I added all the terms, and each term divided by the total would give me its share of the total portfolio. But there were several problems with this approach:

1. It is too black and white. In reality there are multiple outcomes, not just profit and bankruptcy. If I have the probabilities of partial winnings and partial profits, I should be able to use this extra information for better approximations.

2. It is illogical for special cases. If I have an investment opportunity with a winning probability of 100% and cash flows higher than other opportunities, then my calculation would not tell me to put 100% of my money into it, which is obviously irrational because of the high profit and zero risk.

Later I stumbled upon the Kelly Criterion for bet sizing and tried applying it. Again, I faced the black and white problem, but then also the fact that I couldn't generalize it to more than one bet, because the Kelly Formula is meant for single bets. In the end I found some articles detailing solutions to my problems, but the math was way to complicated for me to comprehend.

,investing,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson &amp; Johnson:

Johnson &amp; Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson &amp; Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\-  Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

&gt;\-  Litigation surrounding several J&amp;J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
&gt;  
&gt;(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Current Annual Payout / Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;$4.04&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2.76%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;6.0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Current EPS Payout Ratio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;64.64%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2021&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2022&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2023&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2024&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2025&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Payout&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$4.28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$4.53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$4.81&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$5.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;$5.40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!&lt;/p&gt;

And also I use websites like ValueWalk, Screener, Gurufocus, Validea, etc to pick possible stock based off premade screeners built based off what investment Guru's look for.

But before dropping a bunch of cash, sitting and forgetting, I am curious if these websites are reliable and take the work out of manually looking at a stocks SEC documents every time they release financal information. To be more specific, are these website stocm ratings(Zack's ABC's, Gurufocus 1 to 10, ChartMill stars, etc) and guru screeners trustworthy or are they essentially useless, even with the strictest settings which I like to use(Everything has to have the highest score in everything).

And if they are extremely reliable/useful, are they reliable enough to render investment experts like Financal Advisord, Wealth Management Planners and Investment Consultants obsolete or, at the very least, too overpriced compared to what one could get from these websites?

If you're questioning if I'm using the sites correctly, allow me to explain my top picks. I've settled on investing in companies like WIT, MIXT and PRIM because they all have high marks on at least 3 of the websites I named above.

WIT was scores highly for financals and profitibilty on. Plus it was listed as a 3.5/5 for earnings preditability, a 0.97 for revenue preditability. It did lag in valuation, all according to Gurufocus. Plus on Zacks, mostly given high marks. And Ken Fisher, Cliff Assess and O'shaughnessy are shareholders.

MIXT also had very high scores for financals and profitibilty, it has a Predictable margin exp in Gurufocus, it ranked #2 using Zacks and Jim Simon's is a shareholder.

PRIM is rated high for financals, profitability and valuation (though it is a little lower for it's financal strength than I'd prefer). It also passed my screener on Finviz which requires every fundimental criteria to be acceptable (Past, present and future EPS Growth positive along with the Sales growth, ROE, ROI, ROA, Gross/Operating/Net-Profit Margin, and low Debt, Current/Quick Ratio). It is #1 for Zacks and has all A's on Zacks for Value/Growth/Momentum. And David Shaw, Cliff Asness and John Overdeck are shareholders.

I also have settled.on CODA, PLAB, HOLI, etc as they are runners up for being highly rated on at least 2 sites. KOZAY is an OTC stock which peaks my interest because of Gurufocus as it's the only OTC stock(with a good Beneish M-Score) under $30 with a near perfect score plus it has the highest overall score of all stocks under $30 where it's is an 8/10 for financal strength and a 9/10 for profitabilit and it's undervalued. 

HVT is the only stock on Validea that mostly qualifies as an investment opertunity with it being listed on at least 8 prebuilt Guru screeners.

When glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.

Possible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.

The risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.

The stock market isn’t a bubble, but parts of it are on fire.

So far in 2020, the NYSE FANG+ index of giant technology stocks is up 78%. The [Renaissance IPO ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO), [IPO **1.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO?mod=chiclets)an exchange-traded fund that holds recent public offerings, is up 84%. The [SPDR S&amp;P Kensho Clean Power ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG), [CNRG **+1.35%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG?mod=chiclets)which invests in renewable-energy companies, has gained 88%.

Meanwhile, the overall stock market is up almost 11%.

That’s a key difference.

For years, anyone who thinks any financial asset is somewhat overvalued has called it a bubble. The financial use of “bubble” [originated centuries ago ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-TOTALB-501?mod=article_inline)to describe massive speculation that [inflates market prices to the bursting point](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-does-a-bubble-spell-trouble-1389399975?mod=article_inline).

Financial bubbles have never had a formal definition, though, and they are [diabolically difficult to identify](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204621904577017960729384948?mod=article_inline) without the benefit of hindsight. A new book, “Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles,” by finance scholars William Quinn and John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, helps clarify the muddled thinking on the topic.

The image of a bubble is itself a misnomer. As any kid who’s ever chewed gum knows, bubbles often barely expand before bursting, and they don’t bother anybody much except parents and teachers.

Financial markets, however, can easily heat up fivefold or even 10-fold and then collapse at least 50% in a flash, burning millions of speculators and sometimes charring entire economies. Think of the U.S. after [the stock market crash of 1929](https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-the-buy-and-hold-gospel-to-the-ultimate-test-11572015606?mod=article_inline), or [Japan 60-plus years later](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/23/excited-about-the-nasdaq-record-dont-overpay-for-tech-again/).

Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.

“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “[the fire triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle).” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.

The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.

On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BRK.B) Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.

The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.

Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.

The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.

That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But [hedge funds and other institutions](https://www.fmg.ac.uk/pwc/publications/discussion-papers/institutional-theory-momentum-and-reversal-0) also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.

The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been [updated with a fourth component](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/Reporters-Guide-to-Fire-and-NFPA/All-about-fire#tri), an “exothermic chain reaction.”

Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.

That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.

“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.

That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.

In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without [technology companies](http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/99_12.pdf), the S&amp;P 500 would have been up only 5%.

Today isn’t much different.

In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&amp;P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.

To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&amp;P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.

I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and [shell companies formed to do buyouts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline).

The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&amp;P 500 also tumbled.

Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like [Amazon.com](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) Inc. That might be the firebreak that this market needs.",t2_m915wcj,False,,0,False,WSJ: A Stock Market Bubble?

&lt;p&gt;Financial bubbles have never had a formal definition, though, and they are &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204621904577017960729384948?mod=article_inline""&gt;diabolically difficult to identify&lt;/a&gt; without the benefit of hindsight. A new book, “Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles,” by finance scholars William Quinn and John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, helps clarify the muddled thinking on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of a bubble is itself a misnomer. As any kid who’s ever chewed gum knows, bubbles often barely expand before bursting, and they don’t bother anybody much except parents and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial markets, however, can easily heat up fivefold or even 10-fold and then collapse at least 50% in a flash, burning millions of speculators and sometimes charring entire economies. Think of the U.S. after &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-the-buy-and-hold-gospel-to-the-ultimate-test-11572015606?mod=article_inline""&gt;the stock market crash of 1929&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=""https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/23/excited-about-the-nasdaq-record-dont-overpay-for-tech-again/""&gt;Japan 60-plus years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle""&gt;the fire triangle&lt;/a&gt;.” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BRK.B""&gt;Berkshire Hathaway&lt;/a&gt; Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But &lt;a href=""https://www.fmg.ac.uk/pwc/publications/discussion-papers/institutional-theory-momentum-and-reversal-0""&gt;hedge funds and other institutions&lt;/a&gt; also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been &lt;a href=""https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/Reporters-Guide-to-Fire-and-NFPA/All-about-fire#tri""&gt;updated with a fourth component&lt;/a&gt;, an “exothermic chain reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without &lt;a href=""http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/99_12.pdf""&gt;technology companies&lt;/a&gt;, the S&amp;amp;P 500 would have been up only 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today isn’t much different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline""&gt;shell companies formed to do buyouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&amp;amp;P 500 also tumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN""&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; Inc. That might be the firebreak that this market needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Because this has been a contentious topic lately, here's a graph that shows the inverse P/E ratio (the rate of return) minus interest rates as well as the SPX level. 


Stocks get expensive when, relative to bonds, they are outside some return threshold. Seems to be around 1% or at most 2%, which is the difference between AAA-rated bonds and T-bill values.


I am almost certain that if you extend this back 100 years, you'll see the same concept: 

Stocks are expensive when they pass below a certain threshold here, say 1%, and cheap when they pass above 2% difference between stocks and bonds.

,investing,"It is no secret that, save for a few firms, investment companies fail to beat stock market index funds. While there are a lot of theories about why this is, this is mine:

I believe that the main reason that investors don't beat the market is that popular analysis and investor sentiment regarding stock picking and investment strategy, while looking solid on the surface, is fatally flawed and leads to significant underperformance. Let me start with analysts.

It is no secret that wall street analysts are heavily incentivized to follow the pack when it comes to stock recommendations. *When you're wrong and you're in a crowd, nothing happens, but when you're wrong and you stand alone, you lose your job*. Why bother voicing your opinion when it could cost you your career? Most companies on the market aren't worth investing in, yet stock market analysts are statistically more likely to give stocks a buy rating than a sell rating. This is because of the fee structure that many analyst-firms follow, with many companies pretty much paying analysts to give them a buy rating. Overall, analysts are focused on their reputation, if they rate a company as sell and they are wrong, not only will that company no longer give them their business, but their reputation is significantly damaged. To avoid this, they lie. This is bad on its own, but when combined with institutions who trust these ratings, it is a recipe for underperformance.

Many institutions trust analysts' biased ratings. They buy when a buy rating is shown, and they sell when a sell rating is shown. On top of trusting foolish ratings, most funds are hyper-focused on the short-term movements of a stock. Why do they do this? Because if the fund doesn't show immediate returns, their investors flee to another fund that is. This ultra-focus on short-term price movements is damaging. As Ben Graham said, *""In the short-run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine""*. Short-term movements of a stock's price are random and impossible to consistently predict. They are white noise, a product of whatever captivates the mind of the market at any one point in time. Long-term stock performance, on the other hand, is directly connected to the intrinsic value of a company and, when using proper analysis, is much more predictable.

,investing,"Good morning Reddit,

markets are betting on the company that will market the first effective Covid vaccine.

However, Peter Lynch once said ""a great patients' drug is one that cures an affliction once and for all, but a great investor's drug is one that the patient has to keep buying"".

Bitcoin has one of its wealthiest backers yet.

[Ricardo Salinas Pliego](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/14012146), Mexico’s third-richest person, said in a Twitter post Tuesday he’s invested a chunk of his liquid assets in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

“Many people ask me if I have bitcoins,” said Salinas, who has a $11.8 billion fortune through his stakes in retail, banking and broadcast businesses, according to the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/). “YES. I have 10% of my liquid portfolio invested it.”

Bitcoin is nearing record highs after more than doubling this year, partly driven by fears that major central bank easing and fiscal stimulus will debase currencies. The digital asset [advanced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/bitcoin-tops-17-000-for-first-time-since-december-2017) for a third session Wednesday, outperforming most of its rivals to break above $18,000. Its performance has attracted some big Wall Street money managers including Fidelity Investments, which launched a Bitcoin fund over the summer, and macro investor [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1704916).

In a series of tweets Tuesday, hedge fund founder [Ray Dalio](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1801626) questioned the cryptocurrency’s utility as a storehold of wealth, but [added](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/ray-dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin): “I might be missing something about Bitcoin, so I’d love to be corrected.”

Other wealthy Bitcoin backers include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who are [now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/winklevoss-twins-ride-bitcoin-surge-to-become-billionaires-again) worth about $1 billion each from the cryptocurrency’s surge, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Bitcoin’s gains have helped make up for Salinas’s business interests. Shares in his biggest listed asset -- conglomerate [Grupo Elektra SAB](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ELEKTRA%2A:MM) \-- have slumped more than 10% this year, while those in the local [television network](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AZTECACP:MM) he and his family control have dropped almost 60%.

A spokesman for Salinas didn’t immediately reply to an email and phone call seeking comment.

Salinas, 65, who contracted Covid-19 last month, [said](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1328895703486255104) in a later tweet he first invested in Bitcoin four years ago, adding he holds the balance of his liquid portfolio in precious metals miners. Salinas and his family have earned more than $500 million through dividends from their listed holdings in the past two decades, according to the Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Salinas has also used Twitter to comment on the pandemic. He previously called for Mexico’s health officials to stop imposing “[authoritarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/mexican-billionaire-says-health-officials-are-wrecking-economy)” policies to contain the spread of virus and took to the site again to reveal his own diagnosis.

,investing,"At the New York Times' DealBook Online Summit (Nov 17-18 2020), Masayoshi Son (CEO of Softbank) said they are preparing for the worst case scenario despite of the incoming covid vaccine. The worst case scenario he laid out is that one major company can go down and create a domino effect in the market. It's unusual for Softbank to be bearish because they are known to buy billions of dollars of call options in big techs, which drives up the prices significantly.

Does that mean Softbank will gradually wind down its positions in high-flying stocks and take up more defensive position? Maybe.

,investing,"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&amp;D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

&gt;\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud &amp; Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

EDIT: Fixed some math errors. Thanks everyone for the comments, remember this post wasn't an endorsement or recommendation to buy or sell, just something to get brain juices going.

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2018&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;79,591&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,711&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;42,656&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;77,147&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,844&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;66,883&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn&amp;#39;t been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s answer some of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there revenue growth?  - No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there earnings growth? - No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Cash Flow from Operations&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Capital Expenditures&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;FCF/E Ratio&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2011&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;19,846&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4,108&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,787&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;17,225&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,579&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;13,594&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;14,770&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,286&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;31,365&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating ~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting ~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been ~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s quickly look into where the money is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Revenue Sector&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2018&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year-Year Change&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Cloud &amp;amp; Cognitive Software&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;22,209&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;23,200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;+6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Global Business Services&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,595&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,634&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;+2.4%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Global Tech Services&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;29,146&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;27,361&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-3.7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud &amp;amp; Business services growing at a ~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the big if?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big &amp;quot;IF&amp;quot; is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Some other numbers:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Current Annual Payout / Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;$6.52&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5.84%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Current EPS Payout Ratio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;72.77%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Years on Consecutive Div Increase&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;25 Years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won&amp;#39;t be talking about it in detail here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone&amp;#39;s opinion about the company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!&lt;/p&gt;

ARK Investment Management-a privately-held asset manager founded just six years ago-has been in the spotlight a lot this year thanks to its vocal founder and stellar investment record.

A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year.

**It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021.** ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake.

Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement.

Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research for Morningstar, highly doubts there will be a management change at ARK. ""Resolute has been operating largely at arm's length, distributing products and opening doors for the ARK team and not necessarily meddling in their day-to-day affairs and telling them how to manage money,"" says Johnson, ""What they want to do is to exercise the call option that is very much in the money right now, that's what they signed up on.""",t2_cotyg,False,,0,False,"Cathie Wood Might Lose Control of ARK, the Company She Founded",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jx7t8u,False,dark,0.9,,public,114,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,114,,False,,1605809529.0,,[],{},,True,,1605838126.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.barrons.com/articles/cathie-wood-might-lose-control-of-ark-investment-51605699000""&gt;Cathie Wood Might Lose Control Of ARK Investment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Key points:

- In the next couple of decades, due to the falling production costs, fossil fuels will continue to lead as the primary energy source, even with the increased investments in, and generation of, renewables. Oil will continue to remain the dominant source for energy for transport while in the heating sector, natural gas will take the lead role. Faster transition resulting in an earlier end of fossil fuel dependence is possible with strong and consistent sustainable development policies and efficient disbursement of investments; but there may not be major renewable projects that can be brought online in the immediate future. Therefore, at the global level, cheaper fossil fuels may continue to support demand and discourage clean energy solutions for some time.

- Major oil and gas companies are observing development of green hydrogen with keen interest. This is also a part of Europe’s green deal package with numerous investment support policies, pilot projects and a dozen roadmaps for using hydrogen for energy.

- Any major government support is likely to be for projects that accelerate the energy transition to a zero carbon emission economy or transition from the fossil fuels industry.

&lt;p&gt;What are your views in last week&amp;#39;s moves in the market? Post vaccine announcement we saw a shift from defensive growth techs into cyclical and so called value (I use the value term loosely as it can have different meanings for a lot of investors)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a quant - what do you see in the recent rotation move? Sustainable or it&amp;#39;s still a one way bet on momentum and growth and why? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a fundamental investor what do you see? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a macro investors what are you views of of it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re the buffet/value investor do you think it&amp;#39;s sustainable and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imo, I have yet to see inflationary pressure for cyclicals to make sustained gains, but I cant ignore the the size of the moves. Yield curve should steepen and may support some of the cyclicals to continue to gain traction. Overall, have a balance between defensive growth and cyclical/early recovery stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

Some companies like Greyscale, PayPal, and Fidelity, while not investing in Bitcoin itself, have created services and derivative products that hope to extract substantial revenue from Bitcoin investors.  

These large players have justified their choice with the claim that Bitcoin is a good hedge investment because its market price is uncorrelated with the real economy or with the price of other traditional hedges, such as gold, real estate, or T-bonds; and its value is somehow likely to increase, even while those assets lose their because of the pandemic.  

This claim has some rational justification, since Bitcoin's does not have any significant interaction with the real economy or a ""fundamental"" value derived from expected dividends. Its market price is therefore not affected by business closures, unemployment, or a possible hyper-devaluation of the dollar.

,investing,"Hey everyone,
I’ve more recently started getting interested in the oil and gas industry, specifically Canadian and US companies. With covid, obviously stocks have taken a massive hit, but I don’t see them going much lower. Due to the cyclical nature of the industry, I believe we might be near the bottom and within 6-12 months as oil demand increases these stocks may rebound. My belief is that investing now might be a good opportunity to gain off the rebound of the industry since many stocks are basically as low now as ever in the last 10 years. My opinion is that I wouldn’t invest in the industry for a long time and hold, but as a 2-4 year play this might be good.

I’ve more recently started getting interested in the oil and gas industry, specifically Canadian and US companies. With covid, obviously stocks have taken a massive hit, but I don’t see them going much lower. Due to the cyclical nature of the industry, I believe we might be near the bottom and within 6-12 months as oil demand increases these stocks may rebound. My belief is that investing now might be a good opportunity to gain off the rebound of the industry since many stocks are basically as low now as ever in the last 10 years. My opinion is that I wouldn’t invest in the industry for a long time and hold, but as a 2-4 year play this might be good.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't seen any discussion of the M1 chip on this subreddit (maybe something was deleted) so I wanted to bring it up and hear everyone's takes.

The ARM architecture has hitherto been largely restricted to low power consumption devices (phones, tablets), but the M1 chip may popularize larger, higher performance form factors, providing direct competition to Intel and AMD, who design chips with the x86 and x86-64 architecture, the typical architecture in most PCs and Macs.

Here is some reading I have done on the recent news:

A wikipedia article on Apple's transition to ARM processorsr:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac\_transition\_to\_Apple\_Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_Silicon)

Another article talking about Microsoft's efforts to move to the ARM architecture as well:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few discussion questions:

  
Is the threat to x86 architecture firms overstated?

Which companies are best suited to take advantage of this shift if it occurs?

Does this affect the softbank sale and NVIDIA acquisition of ARM holdings?

Any other lesser known companies that will benefit or lose out from a bigger shift to ARM computing?

- The latest contender for street supremacy is the e-scooter, which can be rented by the minute using a smartphone app. Startups have launched scooter services in cities around the world, and the pandemic has strengthened the case for their adoption. In Berlin, which has thousands of e-scooters, usage rose when lockdown eased in May 2020.

- Will Norman, says London has added 40 miles of temporary bike lanes. Nationally, the government has pledged £2bn ($3.2bn) towards new cycling and walking infrastructure.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the pandemic, however, people have been opting for more solitary options such as cars and bicycles. But street space is in short supply in dense cities such as New York and Paris. As a result, big cities should expect big changes in how people get around in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest contender for street supremacy is the e-scooter, which can be rented by the minute using a smartphone app. Startups have launched scooter services in cities around the world, and the pandemic has strengthened the case for their adoption. In Berlin, which has thousands of e-scooters, usage rose when lockdown eased in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Norman, says London has added 40 miles of temporary bike lanes. Nationally, the government has pledged £2bn ($3.2bn) towards new cycling and walking infrastructure. During the summer, cycle traffic recovered to pre-pandemic levels on many commuter routes into central London, even as offices remain largely empty. In 2021 many more commuters will opt for pedal power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

#The math:

(Using Canadian values)

Cost of borrowing = 1.5% + benchmark -- gets lower over $100K

CAD benchmark rate = -0.0037% [0] -- fluctuates daily

Margin requirement = 30% to 50% [1]

Max S&amp;P drawdown in a given recession: 56% (2007) [2]

**So, with expected gains at 7%, and borrowing costs at ~1.5%, isn't this a no brainer?**

Leverage your portfolio to 1.5-2x, and enjoy 78% (7%/(7%-1.5%)) higher returns as long as you can hold onto the position.

---

#Risk:

Having margin requirement raised. Happened during the recent US election. Could push you into a margin call. Only about 1 week notice.

IB will just liquidate you without warning.

A recession could wipe you out if your leverage is at or over 2x if it's as bad as 2008.

---

#Other things:

Potential to earn income for lending out hard to borrow shares (not much)

Monthly fee of $10 and transaction fees

Will be earning money through work to reduce leverage, even in the event of recession (assuming no job loss) so may be able to hold onto position for longer.

&gt;- Affirm filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “AFRM.”

&gt;- The installment loan and payments company, led by PayPal alumni Max Levchin, saw 98% revenue growth year over year, according to documents filed with the SEC Wednesday.

&gt;- Net losses dropped fell by roughly half to $15.3 million in the three months ending September 30th.

&gt;The eight-year-old company brought in roughly $510 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended on June 30 -- a 93% jump from last year, according to the filing. In the three months ending Sept. 30, revenue grew 98% year over year, while net losses fell by roughly half to $15.3 million.

&gt;Even if they don’t charge interest, Affirm earns a fee when they help a merchant make a sale. On the consumer side, they earn interest income on loans they buy from bank partners. Affirm also earns interest on some consumer loans. The rate they charge varies by consumers’ creditworthiness, but often starts at 0%.

&gt;Affirm said gross merchandise volume -- a key metric in the payments industry -- grew by 77% year over year. It has more than 6.5 million customers. Roughly 64% of loans on Affirm this year were taken out by repeat consumers.

&gt;The company plans to offer two classes of stock, an increasingly common practice among Silicon Valley start-ups. Class A will have one vote, while Class B common stock will have 15 votes. Max Levchin, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer, will have voting control of the company.

Thought this was a great video to share to calibrate expectations for the upcoming 6 months to 1 year. It goes through what an economic recovery looks like for markets (the ""reflation"" trade) and which asset classes you would expect to outperform in the scenario. It also goes through the real risk of inflation and deflationary scenarios based on past data and trends. 

Highlights: 

\- The reflation trade is an expectation that a global economic recovery will take place that takes equities (especially global and emerging market equities) and commodity prices higher due to increased demand. Value and beat up sectors will outperform growth due to a recovery in demand and the relative lag. 

\- Reflation and inflation are not the same. Inflation can happen with or without economic growth, which leads to stagflation and likely a stall in asset price appreciation. 

\-  Reasons for possible inflation: Money supply has exploded higher along with savings rates. While it has not made its way into the economy yet, the impetus of economic growth could make banks more open to lending and people spending their savings; leading to higher money velocity and higher inflation. Fiscal stimulus to combat the slowdown could over reach and cause a spending spree by putting the money directly into the hands of individual who will spend it rather than banks who have been reluctant to lend. 

\- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand. We are likely entering into a double dip recession with increased lockdowns. 

\- Inflation could be destabilizing : Inflation will lead to higher yields for all debt. At record US debt levels and without higher growth, this could make it difficult for overextended companies to roll over debt increasing default risk. It will also lead to a depreciation in fixed income instruments, causing a domino effect of deleveraging due to asset prices falling. This was seen in taper tantrum of 2018. 

\- Yield curve control will attempt to backstop this possibility if it happens. 

\- Good to own bonds at the long end of the curve (ex. TLT) if you are long equities right now and want to protect against a deflationary response.",t2_z4liv1a,False,,0,False,Excellent Explanation of the Risks of Growth vs Stagflation in the Economic Recovery,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jx3epw,False,dark,0.47,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605824096.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9h1Smlrj0""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9h1Smlrj0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand. We are likely entering into a double dip recession with increased lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Inflation could be destabilizing : Inflation will lead to higher yields for all debt. At record US debt levels and without higher growth, this could make it difficult for overextended companies to roll over debt increasing default risk. It will also lead to a depreciation in fixed income instruments, causing a domino effect of deleveraging due to asset prices falling. This was seen in taper tantrum of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Yield curve control will attempt to backstop this possibility if it happens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Good to own bonds at the long end of the curve (ex. TLT) if you are long equities right now and want to protect against a deflationary response.&lt;/p&gt;

Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us under which they cannot sell, offer, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, lend, or otherwise dispose of shares of our capital stock, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction or arrangement that is designed to or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition or transfer of any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of our capital stock, until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the “lock-up period”), except as described below and subject to certain other exceptions.

In addition, certain record holders subject to market standoff agreements with us have not signed the lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period.

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/: “One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”

“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”


******

Questions: 

1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares? 
******
2) I read ""Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us"" to mean current officers are subject to 80% lockup until 3rd trading date after Q4 results, around 2/17/2021. But based on Soros' statement and 13F, SCM sold 20%. Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this? 
******
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade? 
******
4) ANSWERED Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)? 

Found this: https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/exchangeactreporting
So basically all early employees and investors are record holders. Let's not waste too much effort on Soros then. Main questions: Where did 257,135,415 on page 1 of S1 come from? How many shares are likely to be sold after lockup?

******
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded). 
******
6) 6) It gets even more confusing sadly....

9/29 Press release which seems to contradict the last S1A from 9/21:
https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements/default.aspx
As of September 28, 2020, there were an aggregate of 475.8 million shares of common stock that will be permitted to be sold starting on the first day of trading pursuant to Palantir’s market standoff or lock-up agreements. These 475.8 million shares consisted of (i) an aggregate of 407.7 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units in connection with the listing (“RSUs”). We estimate that, as of September 28, 2020, greater than 90% of the 475.8 million shares of common stock that are permitted to be sold under market standoff or lock-up restrictions consisted of outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of common stock underlying stock options or RSUs.

So is it 380 or 475 and thing bothering me most--why does page 1 of S1A say 257?

We’ve all heard it before -  dividend growth portfolios lag the low/no dividend stocks/ETF in the long term. 

Not really looking to debate that. Let’s just assume/agree it’s true.

Has anyone ever done a calculation though (or know where to begin) to see how that would change if we allocate a percentage of the portfolio to a stable, high dividend stock/ETF - that instead of DRIP-ing into itself disperses its dividend equally to the portfolio, still skewed heavy growth?

Would that outpace a traditional growth portfolio or still lag it?

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever done a calculation though (or know where to begin) to see how that would change if we allocate a percentage of the portfolio to a stable, high dividend stock/ETF - that instead of DRIP-ing into itself disperses its dividend equally to the portfolio, still skewed heavy growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would that outpace a traditional growth portfolio or still lag it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All calculations always seem to be done with DRIP in mind rather than dividend re allocation to all holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I am new to investing and had an idea which i am not sure is good or silly.

As I am new to this game and am not confident in betting big on any one company yet I am leaning towards ETF’s. 

My idea on this is as follows:
What if I were to spread my savings money (which is a relatively large sum to me) among a number of ETF’s I think would be good in the long term, e.g:
Spread across S&amp;P 500, World Market ETF, Chinese Market ETF, Clean Energy ETF, HealthCare ETF 

Now as most ETF tend to boat steady rise over long periods would it not be good to make movements of funds between an ETF that is on a spike to one that is in a dip for E.g (hypothetical):
Moving a large portion of the money in the World Market ETF (which is on a big spike) to the Clean Energy ETF (which is in a big dip).

As ETF tends to boast gains over time would this tactic mean I might miss less drops in value and experience more rises as time goes by?

*Epistemic Status: I will be staking Eth in the beacon chain*

It certainly has similarities to perpetual bonds. The main two differences are that your rewards fall as more people stake to validate and the lack of liquidity in Phase 0. I will be curious to see how it will work once phase 1.5 is reached.

&gt;In the world of crypto and Proof of Stake, staking bonds can be viewed as a type of contractor license bond. Ethereum Validators, for example, are required to stake 32 ETH as collateral to register their node on the network and in return obtain the ‘license’ to support consensus operations on-chain.

&gt;By obtaining this license, the validator agrees to adhere to the network’s rules, which is to behave honestly and guarantee continued operations. In return, they receive periodic rewards.

&gt;The bond in this case is an agreement structured between:

WASHINGTON—Chinese companies with shares traded in America would be required to use auditors overseen by U.S. regulators or face being kicked off exchanges under a plan being drafted by regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.

The proposal, which is likely to be issued for public comment in December, would address the disparate treatment that applies to Chinese companies going public in the U.S. The firms have long been able to sell shares here, yet their auditors violate a key investor protection: China hasn’t allowed their work to be inspected.

Auditor supervision has been overseen by a special watchdog—the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board—since the accounting scandals that took down Enron Corp. nearly 20 years ago. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken different tacks to try to get China’s cooperation with the PCAOB, from suing its audit firms to get information on fraudulent companies, to negotiating with Chinese regulators and issuing public warnings to U.S. investors about the problem.

Now, the SEC’s proposal would put the onus on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq NDAQ -0.23% Stock Market to require compliance with the audit inspections—or bar a new Chinese company from listing. Those with shares already traded here would have a few years to comply before possibly losing their listing.

The SEC is moving fast to propose key elements of the plan before the departure of Chairman Jay Clayton, who announced Monday that he plans to leave by the end of December.

China has said it is worried about auditors revealing strategic secrets held by domestic firms, some of which are majority-owned by the Chinese government. The country put up a new hurdle this year, implementing a law that prevents its citizens and companies from complying with overseas securities regulators without the permission of its own market supervisor and other components of the Chinese government.


To address that issue, the SEC’s plan includes a separate proposal to allow Chinese firms to get a second review of their books by an accounting firm based in a country where auditors comply with PCAOB oversight. The audit firm doing the work would likely assume liability for the opinion it provides, and the PCAOB could check the work.

The details for such “co-audits” would need to be spelled out in a regulation. The SEC would have to address obstacles to such arrangements, including the political and regulatory risks the second auditor might encounter in China.

“How do you meet the U.S. goal which is an audit subject to a meaningful inspection, and what appears to be the Chinese goal of limiting the access to information held in China?” said Paul Leder, an attorney at Miller &amp; Chevalier and former head of the SEC’s Office of International Affairs.

Another wild card: It’s unclear how much China still values access to U.S. exchanges for its companies, and thus how much it is willing to negotiate. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which went public on the NYSE in 2014, chose to raise $13 billion in a Hong Kong share sale last year. Ant Group Co., the fast-growing financial-technology giant that grew out of Alibaba, was set to raise $34 billion in Shanghai and Hong Kong before the Chinese government halted the deal.

The SEC’s proposals would take months to adopt and implement, and Mr. Clayton’s successor and the Biden administration could seek to tweak the approach.

The SEC’s anticipated moves follow recommendations issued by a panel of U.S. policy makers in July that suggested how to address the inspections standoff. The panel, known as the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, recommended tightening the exchanges’ standards for listing Chinese companies.


NYSE and Nasdaq have declined to voluntarily change their listing rules as the President’s Working Group suggested, people familiar with the matter said. Such a move could have taken effect more quickly than a new SEC regulation.

Nasdaq officials felt they couldn’t implement the listing rule without clearer guidance from the SEC about how co-audits would work, a person familiar with the matter said. Nasdaq in May moved to raise its minimum requirements for listing companies from countries where PCAOB cannot inspect auditors, a step that could discourage initial public offerings by smaller Chinese firms. NYSE declined to comment.

Booting Chinese companies from U.S. capital markets would hurt the revenues of NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., ICE 0.36% and Nasdaq. The shares could still trade over the counter.

Both exchanges earn annual listing fees from such companies and benefit from the trading activity that comes from their shares. More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.


Congress is weighing its own solution. In May, the Senate passed a bill that would give Chinese companies and their auditors three years to comply with inspection requirements—or face delisting from Nasdaq and NYSE. Similar bipartisan legislation passed the House as an amendment to a defense-spending bill.

While the SEC plans to publicize its proposed actions in December, the agency will likely issue other proposals directing public companies and mutual funds to amplify their disclosure of the audit-inspection risks associated with China, the people said. Those other proposals may not be finished before Mr. Clayton leaves, the people said.",t2_l9j74,False,,0,False,"SEC Pursues Plan Requiring Chinese Firms to Use Auditors Overseen by U.S: Under proposal, companies would be shut out of U.S. exchanges if they don’t comply",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jvs205,False,dark,0.97,,public,390,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,390,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605644468.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-pursues-plan-requiring-chinese-firms-to-use-auditors-overseen-by-u-s-11605614403""&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-pursues-plan-requiring-chinese-firms-to-use-auditors-overseen-by-u-s-11605614403&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion, according to data from S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress is weighing its own solution. In May, the Senate passed a bill that would give Chinese companies and their auditors three years to comply with inspection requirements—or face delisting from Nasdaq and NYSE. Similar bipartisan legislation passed the House as an amendment to a defense-spending bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the SEC plans to publicize its proposed actions in December, the agency will likely issue other proposals directing public companies and mutual funds to amplify their disclosure of the audit-inspection risks associated with China, the people said. Those other proposals may not be finished before Mr. Clayton leaves, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;

“Wow. They beat earnings and their stock fell.”

“LOL, didn’t meet expectations, stock still up 5%”

Come on people. I get that there’s a cynical humor that helps cope with an ever changing market, but these comments make it seem like people expect good news to always mean that a stock goes up, and bad news to always mean that a stock goes down. 

When will people realize that 1) most of the volume of the market is automated and algorithmic and/or institutional and based on deeper factors and 2) the stock market is way more complex than “good is up, bad is down.”

I think that maybe with Robinhood and free transaction trading, lots of lay people are getting involved with stocks and they treat it as gambling - buy before a big event, sell afterwards. They don’t realize that there’s mathematics PhDs running super computers that manage transactions for large institution firms at the microsecond level trying to figure out a small part of the complexity that beginners simplify into “good is up and bad is down.”

So here’s the PSA part: THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT AN INDICE FOR HOW A COMPANY OR ECONOMY IS DOING.

,investing,"Crosspost from r/wsb 

Hi everyone, I have started doing weekly valuations and daily market debriefs. What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and get paid to do this. 

For this week I look at DraftKings, let me know what names you would like me to do next week as well as your feedback. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings.

**What’s new:**   DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42%  year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced  $131mn-$133mn range. [(link)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm) DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.

Also  with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to  $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn  (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This  range doesn’t include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which  could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next.  Management’s guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all  states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars  aren’t disrupted.

**Valuation Methodology:**  I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week – What’s clear  is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be  exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market  will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market  will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing  on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG’s  market share of the  future betting markets. I believe **DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,**  therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the  best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated  Note  on DKNG ‘Limited Changes to Forecasts’ “We expect the market to  continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much  of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors  garnering a  better understanding of how \[that\] ultimately flows to net  revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.” We use 2025 EBITDA as anything  beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to  disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.

I  try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth   figures for both the market and DKNG’s share of that future market   because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a   pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M   to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly   changing company in a disruptive industry and it’s stock price reflects   expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings’   ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth.

**How is the Street valuing DKNG?:**  Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on  equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a  Discounted Cash Flow  model.

Morgan  Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37  valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech  multiple.

Deutsche Bank models  DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA,  discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA  from their current forecast is worth \~$4 to their Price  Target and  every multiple point is \~$2.

**Our Model:**  I start off with management’s 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit  DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth  rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc.  because **DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23**.

If  the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates   from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to   capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%   EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I   get a valuation of around $39, implying \~9% downside. Let’s look closer:

I  start off by estimating the online sports betting and gambling  market  size below. I go off the estimated 2020 figure of around $3.14bn –  $1.33bn from sports gambling, $1.5bn from iGaming, and $286mm from   Daily Fantasy. Next I grow them by the CAGR’s in the previous paragraph   and you see the results. For purposes of this valuation I designate  this  growth profile as my Base case. I don’t want you to stay fixated  on the  \~35% CAGR but rather to see the effects of the rate on overall  market  size come 2025. We can argue all day about the numbers, but  trying to  estimate the growth of the market to the decimal for 5 years  out is not  an efficient exercise. This is still a nascent market  experiencing a lot  of disruption with no clear predecessor case  studies. We get a TAM of over $14bn in 2025 with our estimates.

**Is this a reasonable TAM:**  Deutsche Bank is a noted Bear on this sort of sports betting TAM Share  argument in the 20bn to 25bn  range for sports betting. They say in  their “A Lot of Unfounded  “Expectations” at a Lofty Price; Remain Sell”  Note on Penn National,  “Said simply, in the period from March 2019  through February 2020, prior  to the pandemic, the per adult spend on  sports betting (GGR/NJ adult  population) was $51. Given there are 240  mm adults in the US, to arrive  at even a $20bn TAM, implied that not  only does every state legalize and  all 240 mm adults can bet sports on  their mobile phones, but that … the  adult spend grows by \~65% from this  $51 level”. I look at the idea of full legalization and spend per adult  in the table below.

To get to our $20bn TAM, indeed every  US adult would need to be  spending $84 a year on sports betting and  online gambling. This ties out  with DB’s 65% figure.

Next  I estimate the DraftKings’ EBITDA based on the market size and  their  share of this future market. An important point is DKNG’s  promotions  and how much it subtracts from top-line revenue. We use 20%  here, but  management has stated in the past that promotions are  generally in the  high 20%’s. We give DKNG credit for being able to  continue to decrease  promotional activity in the future, so for our 2025  EBITDA analysis we  settle on 20%. Just for reference, promotions were  \~26% in Q1 and Q2 of  this year.

I use a healthy 30%  EBITDA margin across all levels of market share  and market size. As you  can see, our Base Case is $785 mm in EBITDA for  2025. Not bad for a company expected to have over negative $400mm in  EBITDA for 2020.

Finally, given the current stock price of $42.84 at close on 11/13, what   is the implied 2025E EBITDA multiple for all these scenarios? 

 Every additional turn in the EBITDA multiple adds \~$2 to our price  and  every additional $100 mm in 2025 EBITDA adds \~$5. If the market  grows  by only 15%/ year with lower market share and EBITDA margins in  our  Bear Case, we get a valuation of $14. Likewise, if the market grows  at  45%/year with higher market share and EBITDA margins in our Bull  Case,  we get a $75 valuation. 

**Upside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations
2. Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue
3. DKNG is able to take outsized market share
4. Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting

**Downside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO
2. TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable
3. Promotional activity could last longer than we think and be a drag on revenue
4. Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend
5. Negative legislative outcomes

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I have started doing weekly valuations and daily market debriefs. What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and get paid to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this week I look at DraftKings, let me know what names you would like me to do next week as well as your feedback. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new:&lt;/strong&gt;   DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42%  year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced  $131mn-$133mn range. &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm""&gt;(link)&lt;/a&gt; DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also  with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to  $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn  (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This  range doesn’t include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which  could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next.  Management’s guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all  states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars  aren’t disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt;  I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week – What’s clear  is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be  exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market  will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market  will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing  on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG’s  market share of the  future betting markets. I believe &lt;strong&gt;DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,&lt;/strong&gt;  therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the  best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated  Note  on DKNG ‘Limited Changes to Forecasts’ “We expect the market to  continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much  of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors  garnering a  better understanding of how [that] ultimately flows to net  revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.” We use 2025 EBITDA as anything  beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to  disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth   figures for both the market and DKNG’s share of that future market   because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a   pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M   to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly   changing company in a disruptive industry and it’s stock price reflects   expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings’   ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the Street valuing DKNG?:&lt;/strong&gt;  Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on  equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a  Discounted Cash Flow  model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan  Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37  valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech  multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank models  DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA,  discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA  from their current forecast is worth ~$4 to their Price  Target and  every multiple point is ~$2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Model:&lt;/strong&gt;  I start off with management’s 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit  DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth  rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc.  because &lt;strong&gt;DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates   from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to   capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%   EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I   get a valuation of around $39, implying ~9% downside.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DKNG is able to take outsized market share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downside Risks to Valuation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend&lt;/li&gt;

,investing,"The United States is an aberration among wealthy countries for its permissive gun control regulations. US gun control is particularly unusual for allowing citizens to own military style semi-automatic rifles, also called ""assault weapons."" Democratic and some Republican politicians have been calling for new controls on assault weapons for at least the past five years in response to mass shooting events. For example, Joe Biden has promised to regulate assault weapons under the national firearms act, the same law that regulates machine guns. Up to this point, these gun control efforts have been consistently blocked by a Republican controlled senate, though based on historical precedent Republicans will not keep the senate forever. Democrats have controlled both houses of congress and the presidency in 8 of the last 25 Congressional sessions and it seems likely this will happen again sometime in the next 10 to 20 years. It is also possible that the republican attitude towards gun control will soften in the coming decade, which may have the same effect.  It seems likely that gun control policy in 2035 will be tighter than it is today.

The US uses an unusual legal definition of a firearm that allows speculators to make heavily leveraged bets about the legal future of assault weapons. Under American law, the only regulated part of a firearm is the ""receiver,"" which is a small metal (or plastic) frame that holds in the other parts of the gun. This receiver is legally a gun, and buyers are required to pass a background check before completing their purchase. All other gun parts are completely unregulated, and online sellers can ship complete kits for assault weapons minus the receiver directly to buyers houses. For example, a buyer can purchase a stripped receiver for an AR-15 assault weapon in anticipation of regulatory change, and purchase a kit of remaining parts later if he ever wishes to assemble it into a complete weapon. Receivers cost between 2-5% the price of a complete AR15, which allows speculators to take a highly leveraged position on the future of assault weapon prices.

In the section below, I go through five of the most likely legislative outcomes for assault weapons and give the expected returns to investing in AR-15 lowers. On the 10 - 20 year timeline, I suggest there is a large upside potential (500%+) with a comparably acceptable probability of losing your investment. If you don't want to read through my analysis, I have summarized my conclusions in the payoff matrix below:

&amp;#x200B;

Outcome, Expected Return, Probability on 15 year Horizon

No Change ,                                         , 0%  return,  Medium Probability

NFA regulation but no ban               , 0%                         , Low Probability

Assault Weapons Ban                        , +&gt;500%                , High Probability

Assault Weapons Ban no Transfers , -100%                   , High Probability

Mandatory Buyback                            , -50% to +25%     , Very Low Probability

&amp;#x200B;

Possible regulatory outcomes:

1. No change. The price of AR-15s and stripped lowers moves sideways and the investor makes a loss on shipping and transfer costs if they resell. This seems like the most likely outcome in the short run, but gets increasingly less likely as you look further into the future.
2. Assault weapons are introduced into the national firearms act (NFA) and the ATF continues to issue tax stamps for both new and transferred weapons. This would require buyers to pay a $200 transfer tax and endure 3-12 month waiting period to purchase new or existing lowers. In theory this disincentive will reduce the quantity demanded and will cause prices to fall in the short run as the market is flooded by manufacturers who tooled up to supply a higher demand. Prices should return to normal in the long run as manufacturers retool to supply the new level of demand. The benefit of this outcome is that the investor gets to keep the guns for personal use without paying the $200/gun tax, but will make a loss on shipping and transfer costs if they resell. This seems like an improbable outcome. Legislators who want to see assault weapons banned would be unsatisfied with raising prices by $200, and anti-gun-control legislators would obviously oppose it.
3. Existing assault weapons become transferable under the NFA but the ATF refuses to issue tax stamps for new guns.  No new assault weapons would be produced but existing guns would be transferable with a $200 tax stamp. This is essentially a reprisal of the 1994 assault weapons ban, and would place assault weapons in the same position as machine guns are today. The returns to holding machine guns over the past 50 years have been huge. The stripped lowers for semi-auto and full-auto AR15s are essentially identical,  but the semi-auto lowers sell for under $100 and transferable full-auto lowers sell for over $15000. However, the returns to holding a semi-auto lower after an assault weapons ban would be much smaller than the historical returns to holding a full auto-lower because the existing stock of semi-auto lowers is so much greater. Full auto lowers command such a high price today because there are fewer than 200,000 registered machine guns and millions of people who would like one. Its hard to say how many assault weapons there are in the US today because the number will depend on how legislators define an ""assault weapon,"" but the number is probably north of 10 million ([https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/)). Not all of these guns would be registered with the NFA in the event of an assault weapons ban, but the final number would still be huge and so they would not command a price anywhere near an equivalent machine gun. That said, if prices for stripped lowers rose to just $600, as already happened in 2012, an investor could still earn a return of several hundred percent after transaction costs. This outcome seems very plausible, especially on the 10 to 20 year timeline.
4. Existing assault weapons are grandfathered into the NFA but the ATF refuses to approve transfers. This would mean the investor gets to own a large number of guns that nobody else can have, but they also lose 100% of their investment because they cannot be sold. This outcome seems slightly less likely than outcome #3, but still very possible.
5. Mandatory buyback. Gun owners are ordered to turn in their assault weapons for a nominal fee. This outcome may actually produce a slight profit depending on how the government compensates owners. Typical buyback prices are in $50-$100 range, which is vastly less than the price of a finished AR-15 but can be more than the price paid for a stripped lower. Lowers today sell for a little under $100, but last year they could be had as cheaply as $35. This outcome seems very unlikely because legislators considering a mandatory buyback would likely anticipate that a small but dangerous minority of gun owners would stage some sort of violent resistance.

However, the returns to holding a semi-auto lower after an assault weapons ban would be much smaller than the historical returns to holding a full auto-lower because the existing stock of semi-auto lowers is so much greater. Full auto lowers command such a high price today because there are fewer than 200,000 registered machine guns and millions of people who would like one. Its hard to say how many assault weapons there are in the US today because the number will depend on how legislators define an &amp;quot;assault weapon,&amp;quot; but the number is probably north of 10 million (&lt;a href=""https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/""&gt;https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/&lt;/a&gt;). Not all of these guns would be registered with the NFA in the event of an assault weapons ban, but the final number would still be huge and so they would not command a price anywhere near an equivalent machine gun. That said, if prices for stripped lowers rose to just $600, as already happened in 2012, an investor could still earn a return of several hundred percent after transaction costs. This outcome seems very plausible, especially on the 10 to 20 year timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing assault weapons are grandfathered into the NFA but the ATF refuses to approve transfers. This would mean the investor gets to own a large number of guns that nobody else can have, but they also lose 100% of their investment because they cannot be sold. This outcome seems slightly less likely than outcome #3, but still very possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandatory buyback. Gun owners are ordered to turn in their assault weapons for a nominal fee. This outcome may actually produce a slight profit depending on how the government compensates owners. Typical buyback prices are in $50-$100 range, which is vastly less than the price of a finished AR-15 but can be more than the price paid for a stripped lower. Lowers today sell for a little under $100, but last year they could be had as cheaply as $35. This outcome seems very unlikely because legislators considering a mandatory buyback would likely anticipate that a small but dangerous minority of gun owners would stage some sort of violent resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,investing,"After long periods of speculation and anticipation, Airbnb, the online rentals marketplace, has formally submitted a public filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission. Airbnb is looking to go public 12 years after its founding and with $6.4 billion in equity and debt funding raised over the years as a private company. Particularly, Airbnb is said to be targeting an IPO before the year runs out.

Airbnb's S-1 filing shows $4.8 billion in 2019 revenue and a net loss of $674 million in the same year. In the year before that, the company had $3.65 billion in revenue and a net loss of only $16.9 million.

In the first nine months of this year, however, Airbnb saw its revenue go down by a wide margin as the early months of the coronavirus pandemic brought about global travel restrictions that widely affected its business. The company posted $2.5 billion in revenue in the nine months leading up to September, compared to $3.7 billion in the same period of the previous year. The company's losses also more than doubled within that period from $323 million to $697 million.

As of the end of September this year, Airbnb reported having $4.5 billion in available cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. A significant part of that amount comes from the $2 billion in fresh debt and equity funding that the company raised in April this year when the coronavirus pandemic largely affected its business. The funding came from a group of private equity firms including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.

Notably, Airbnb actually turned a profit in its most recent quarter, reporting $219 million in net income on revenues of $1.34 billion. It comes after the company laid off one-quarter of its workforce in May this year.

Airbnb intends to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ABNB”.

Soros Fund Management and Third Point each bought more than 18 million and 2.4 million shares of Palantir respectively.

“Soros Fund Management, run by billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, and Third Point, the firm led by occasional activist investor Dan Loeb, both disclosed late Friday that they own shares of Palantir.

The Soros investment was worth about $175.3 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That works out to a purchase price of $9.50 a share. Palantir's stock is currently trading at just under $16 a share, so the Soros stake is now valued at about $294 million.

Palantir went public through a direct listing of existing stock on the New York Stock Exchange. That means Palantir didn't need to sell new shares through a more traditional initial public offering. It's how Spotify (SPOT) and Slack (WORK) also started trading on Wall Street.

Shares of Palantir have more than doubled from their so-called reference price of $7.25 a share on the day of the direct listing. Palantir is now worth nearly $30 billion.”

“Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance.

The subject of telehealth seems to have an overwhelming bipartisan support continuing post-pandemic. What would this spell long-term for telehealth companies like Teladoc and Amwell?

&gt; This summer, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) laid out specific policy priorities to ensure Medicare beneficiaries continue to access telehealth services even when the COVID-19 pandemic ends. One of these priorities is to give the Secretary of HHS the authority to expand the list of providers eligible to offer telehealth to their patients.

&gt; “This legislation removes unnecessary statutory barriers that restrict patients’ access to care and empower patients and their providers to decide on the best care options,” said Ann Mond Johnson, CEO of ATA. “As the only organization exclusively dedicated to the advancement of telehealth, the ATA commends Representatives Sherrill and McKinley for introducing the Expanded Telehealth Access Act.”

&gt; “Ensuring access to quality health care is more important now than ever. All too often people who live in rural communities in West Virginia don’t have access to the health care specialists they need,” said Rep. McKinley. “It is crucial that such access via telehealth not end abruptly once the public health emergency ends.”

&gt; According to the CDC, telehealth services have been particularly valuable for vulnerable populations, especially those with compromised immune systems or in rural areas far from a provider. The CDC also notes that expanded telehealth availability is likely to increase health equity. 

&gt; “COVID-19 has underscored the need to provide timely and reliable patient care through telehealth services,” said Rep. Riggleman. “I have been at the forefront of expanding telehealth during my time in Congress, and I am proud to be an original sponsor of this legislation that will expand access to telehealth services to rural and underserved communities.

""During the third quarter, the holding company revealed new stakes in big pharmaceutical names like AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and Pfizer — one of the major companies pioneering a COVID-19 vaccine.

According to a 13-F regulatory filing, Berkshire snapped up approximately 21.2 million shares of AbbVie (ABBV), a stake valued near $2.09 billion based on Monday’s closing price. Berkshire also purchased 29.9 million shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), 22.4 million shares of Merck (MRK), and 3.7 million Pfizer (PFE) shares during the quarter, the filing shows.

Separately, the company boosted its stakes in Bank of America (BAC), General Motors (GM), and Kroger (KR). Berkshire added 3.7 million shares to its Bank of America position, to last hold 1.03 billion shares, a stake valued at $28.48 billion, the second-largest stock position in the portfolio.

Berkshire also purchased shares of Snowflake (SNOW) during the quarter in a private placement. At the quarter’s end, Berkshire held nearly 6.13 million shares, a position valued at around $1.48 billion based on Monday’s closing share price.

During the quarter, Berkshire Hathaway exited its position in Costco (COST) — selling its remaining 4.3 million shares during the period, while trimming its positions in Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services, and M&amp;T Bank.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During the third quarter, the holding company revealed new stakes in big pharmaceutical names like AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and Pfizer — one of the major companies pioneering a COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 13-F regulatory filing, Berkshire snapped up approximately 21.2 million shares of AbbVie (ABBV), a stake valued near $2.09 billion based on Monday’s closing price. Berkshire also purchased 29.9 million shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), 22.4 million shares of Merck (MRK), and 3.7 million Pfizer (PFE) shares during the quarter, the filing shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the company boosted its stakes in Bank of America (BAC), General Motors (GM), and Kroger (KR). Berkshire added 3.7 million shares to its Bank of America position, to last hold 1.03 billion shares, a stake valued at $28.48 billion, the second-largest stock position in the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also purchased shares of Snowflake (SNOW) during the quarter in a private placement. At the quarter’s end, Berkshire held nearly 6.13 million shares, a position valued at around $1.48 billion based on Monday’s closing share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Berkshire Hathaway exited its position in Costco (COST) — selling its remaining 4.3 million shares during the period, while trimming its positions in Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services, and M&amp;amp;T Bank. Berkshire slashed its Wells Fargo stake by nearly 46%, selling 110.2 million shares, to last hold 127.38 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;

As we know, 2020 has been a wild year. With limited travel and limitations on gatherings, the sharing economy has taken quite a hit.  


While AirBnb has felt the impact of COVID, I still believe it is the strongest brand in short-term property rentals and in pleasure travel accommodations. However, the combination of the pandemic + a weakened global economy should lead to less travel and luxury retreats.

&lt;p&gt;As we know, 2020 has been a wild year. With limited travel and limitations on gatherings, the sharing economy has taken quite a hit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AirBnb has felt the impact of COVID, I still believe it is the strongest brand in short-term property rentals and in pleasure travel accommodations. However, the combination of the pandemic + a weakened global economy should lead to less travel and luxury retreats.

https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/airbnbs-directed-share-program-287?c

Here are some important details:

The number of shares available at the IPO price is limited. Receiving this message and completing the form is only the first step in the process and does not guarantee that you will be able to participate.

If more Hosts express an interest in participating than the program is able to accommodate, eligible Hosts may be invited to register by the Administrator based on tenure, as determined by the year they first hosted on Airbnb. Registration will be available on a first come, first served basis, by invitation from the Administrator.

When the program reaches capacity, registration with the Administrator will be closed. If this occurs before you complete the registration steps you will not be able to participate.

Program capacity permitting, Hosts who complete the above form will receive information about the program directly from the Administrator in the coming weeks. By submitting the form, you consent to us sharing your responses with the Administrator.

We expect that there will be a minimum purchase amount of at least $300 in addition to a maximum purchase amount. We may further limit the amount any one Host can purchase depending on total demand for the program and Airbnb’s initial public offering price.

There are certain regulatory and other requirements that may restrict the ability of a Host to participate in the program. Hosts must be United States residents to be eligible.

,investing,"A lot of analysts rely heavily on one or two models they swear by to predict which stocks you should invest in. I have had to use a lot of models in case competitions and throughout college, and while on the surface they look really sophisticated and like they should be reliable, they really are just an excuse to slap whatever valuation you want onto a stock. Most of these models get so abstract with their valuations that tweaking an input or an expected result by just a few percentage points can drastically alter the final valuation, meaning a slight difference between the expectations of the future and what actually happens results in a big difference in both stock performance and earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

Models themselves are a critical part of finance and equity research. They present a simplified picture of a company that is crucial to investors. Yet when models get too abstract and when people rely on models to tell the entire story of a company, things get hairy.

&amp;#x200B;

On the subject, many models rely heavily on ebit and ebitda in its valuations. The issue with this is that while it makes it easier to compare companies, it hides a lot of key issues that can come up. Removing depreciation and amortization from the equation obscures companies with high capital expenditures that suck up a lot of the cash the company makes and makes them look a lot better when compared with companies who have much lower capex costs and as a result get to keep a lot more of their money and put it towards expanding operations and investing in other areas of the company. Removing interest expense from the equation gives an unfavorable advantage to companies laden with debt and high yearly interest payments when compared to companies with low debt and low payments each year. Overall, using ebit and ebitda makes crappy companies look a lot better than they actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

Using models too often and treating them like the word of god is a bad thing, no matter how good they are. Keep in mind though, models do have an important role in company analysis, but too much of anything is bad.

&lt;p&gt;On the subject, many models rely heavily on ebit and ebitda in its valuations. The issue with this is that while it makes it easier to compare companies, it hides a lot of key issues that can come up. Removing depreciation and amortization from the equation obscures companies with high capital expenditures that suck up a lot of the cash the company makes and makes them look a lot better when compared with companies who have much lower capex costs and as a result get to keep a lot more of their money and put it towards expanding operations and investing in other areas of the company. Removing interest expense from the equation gives an unfavorable advantage to companies laden with debt and high yearly interest payments when compared to companies with low debt and low payments each year. Overall, using ebit and ebitda makes crappy companies look a lot better than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using models too often and treating them like the word of god is a bad thing, no matter how good they are. Keep in mind though, models do have an important role in company analysis, but too much of anything is bad. Additionally, ebit and ebitda are a terrible way to compare companies and models that use these a lot should generally should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-15/china-s-electric-vehicle-surge-excites-investors-but-look-again

A quick review of the numbers: Passenger vehicle sales rose 9.5% in October from a year earlier, and have grown every month since May. Green cars, like hybrids and pure electrics, are standouts: Sales are up more than 50%. Stock prices for companies like BYD Co. and NIO Inc. have more than doubled this year. New model launches have boosted sentiment as local automakers incline toward carbon-free. Beijing wants such cars to account for 20% of all sales by 2025.

There’s no doubt that the path is toward a greener future, where electric cars and even more expensive hydrogen-powered vehicles dominate. But here’s the reality right now. Gasoline-powered auto sales are rising, too, around 6%, with 1.9 million manufactured domestically sold in September. 1  This segment accounts for around 90% of passenger cars sold monthly in the world’s largest market, where over 20 million autos were sold last year. Sport utility vehicles and other traditional-engine models that were beginning to find favor pre-slowdown aren’t seeing a big rebound yet. 

Electric car sales – though surging – are rising from a low base and the numbers are small relative to the size of the market, with around 160,000 green autos sold in October. Commercial and passenger new energy vehicles more than doubled last month from a year earlier. However, for the 10-month period, they fell 7.6% to around 875,000. That’s partly because some government subsidies were withdrawn or made harder to get last year. Penetration remains low, at around 6%, according to Jefferies Group LLC analysts.

In recent months, Beijing has released incentives to ease the purchase and financing of electric vehicles for fleets, leading to a faster uptake. Production volumes are up – 70% or 167,000 cars in October, but that’s still down 9% for the whole year, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. analysts. Battery installations tell a similar story.

In short, it feels like MLPs may be a good investment opportunity given their depressed nature (EPD, HEP, TCP, etc), but as many of you are likely aware, MLPs can create some level of tax headache, ranging from K-1 filings (simple), to potential tax evasion opportunities for not filing income tax in every state it operates in (uggh). As a result, I'm looking at alternative vechiles that will capture the MLP return while not issuing me a K-1 in the process. Thing is, my options include CEFs, which I have no familiarity with.

,investing,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoins-price-action-rhymes-with-1970-gold-markets-says-citibank-200544659

CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”

History of Money and Gold
The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.

The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.

And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.

However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.

With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.

The monetary inflation and devaluation of the greenback are the basis of Fitzpatricks’ comparison of Bitcoin with gold. The report reads:

“Bitcoin move happened in the aftermath of the Great Financial crisis (of 2008) which saw a new change in the monetary regime as we went to ZERO percent interest rates.”

Fitzpatrick pointed out that the first bull cycle in Bitcoin from 2011 to 2013 when it increased by 555 times resulted from this.

Currently, the COVID-19 crisis and the government’s associated monetary and fiscal response are creating a similar market environment as gold in the 1970s. Governments have made it clear that they will not shy away from unprecedented money printing until the GDP and employment numbers are back up.

The above analysis is music to the ears of any Bitcoin enthusiast. What has been oft-preached across crypto forums is finally going mainstream.

Hyberbullish Bitcoin Targets
Fitzpatrick did not stop there; his price prediction chart sees Bitcoin price at $318,000 by December 2021.

The four-year bull and bear cycles post 2011 and the ascending parallel channel since 2013 projects growth of 102 times from the low of $3,200 in 2018 by December 2021. It reads:

“You look at price action being much more symmetrical or so over the past seven years forming what looks like a very well defined channel giving us an up move of similar timeframe to the last rally (in 2017).”

Fitzpatrick also pegs gold at $4,000-$8,000 based on an imminent economic crisis in another report.

Therefore, in all likelihood, the targets for BTC might seem exaggerated to traditional investors. Nevertheless, the principle theory of a paradigm shift in the global currency market is not new. Economist Ray Dalio has hinted at the debasement of the dollar and a paradigm shift as well.

Bitcoin might be the missing link in the new paradigm.

&lt;p&gt;CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History of Money and Gold
The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monetary inflation and devaluation of the greenback are the basis of Fitzpatricks’ comparison of Bitcoin with gold. The report reads:&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials markets will provide a better return on invested capital compared other market sectors and will be the main drivers of the next bull market. These industries have been cyclical for decades and this trend won’t change now.

As you all may or may not have noticed, the stock market and especially the tech giants have been on an incredible run as of late. Even though many people expect a general market downturn in the near future, myself included, it cannot be denied that these companies have presented an incredible return on invested capital in the past few months and years. These shares have not been the only ones on a tear in the last few months however, with precious metal miners going up in multiples since the lows seen in march. Because of the way monetary policy is implemented at the moment, with an aggressive targeting of inflation by the FED and the printing of trillions of dollars, I have shifted my attention to what I think will be the next great bull market. Remember, just because something has been going up or going down for a long time, does not mean it will keep being this way, especially not when looking at investing in commodities.

After the decade long bull market we have seen, what do I think will be the next bull market after all this is set and done? Commodities, specifically precious metals followed by industrial materials. We all know that when a currency is being devalued by printing trillions of it, investors tend to take their money and put it into 'safer' investments. These investments have historically been gold and silver, who last experienced great bull markets in the 1980's and after the 2000 dot-com bubble. Now it looks like everything is in place for another massive bull run, where investors will move a part of their portfolio into these assets both as a safety net and an chance to take part in the precious metals bull market. The three decade average holding of precious metals and precious metals related assets in the US has been around 2%, but today it is somewhere between 0.5 and 1%. Especially considering bonds now yield an almost negative return, I have no doubts that the average of 2% will be revisited and overshot, as the biggest competitor of precious metals is providing a negative inflation adjusted return on investment. I am a firm believer that we will see higher gold and silver prices the more the dollar (and other currencies around the world) lose value. How high? Nobody knows, but predictions of $5,000 gold and $100 silver have not been uncommon. What do you invest in? That will be discussed further below.

But am I only going to invest in precious metals? Absolutely not, because while I feel like this bull market is inevitable, I also believe that after the coming economic slowdown that will paint the next two to three years, countries are going to try their hardest to improve their own economies again. This has historically been done with heavy investments in things like infrastructure of all kinds. Regular industrial materials like copper, oil, platinum, lithium, uranium and steel have not been the best investments over the past few years, but an industrial material bull market will change all that. With an economic rebuild comes the need for these materials and because the respective prices for these materials have been relatively low over the past few years, I expect a major turnaround to incentivize the new production the world is going to need to properly get back on its feet. Prices of things like oil, lithium, copper and especially uranium will shoot up and the companies that produce these materials will go right up there with it. I am especially bullish on uranium, of which I wrote about many times of which I believe will reward patient and strong handed investors who can handle it's volatility on the way up.

To truly see how undervalued commodities are compared to regular equities in the S&amp;P 500, I would recommend looking at the chart mentioned here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html)

When something is so underinvested in and has all the catalysts in place to rally upwards, a subsequent bull market will be all the more violent on the upside. According to Rick Rule, one of the best commodity investors of the past few decades and CEO of Sprott Global, this will be the investment of choice for him and all his clients and after looking at the numbers, I can't say anything except I fully agree with him. This investment idea is gaining traction and while it is good to always be diversified, it would almost be foolish not to allocate at least a part of your portfolio into commodities. It is what I will be doing and I expect it to outperform the broad equities market in the coming decade. In a cyclical industry, you are either a contrarian or you are going to be too late.

Now I will share with you what I believe will be the 5 commodities that will benefit the most from a precious metals and industrial materials bull market. These markets are inherently cyclical and after a decade long slowing down of these industries, it is time the cycle fully turns.

1. Uranium

A commodity I have talked about on here at length (if you want to know the details, check my post history) and a commodity that I feel like offers the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment one can make in the current market. In short, uranium is used to fuel nuclear power plants, which are in turn responsible for around 15% of all the power generation in the US and 10% globally. The amount of power plants is growing, mostly in Asia, but the supply has dwindled because of low prices. The price of the commodity has to at the very least double from here to incentivize the new production needed to keep the lights on. There are only a few miners left in this sector and it has a total market cap of around 12 billion dollars, which is ridiculously low for something that provides so much value to power generation. When the general investment community and institutional investors decide to invest in uranium, it will be like moving the contents of the Hoover Dam through a straw.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Cameco (CCJ), Energy Fuels (UUUU) and Denison Mines (DNN)

2. Silver

Often seen as the little brother to gold, I am more bullish on silver than gold for the simple reason that silver is used widely for industrial materials. From solar panels to phones and from medicine to photography, silver is a metal that has many uses and is thus not easily replicable. It is also the case the silver is often not produced as a separate product, but mostly as a side product when mining for things like gold and copper. Add to that the fact that silver can often not be recycled and mostly ends up on the waste dump with the electronics it is in, makes this commodity scarce. The scarcity of this commodity means that if supply is not ramped up significantly, the price will go up because of the enormous demand for this metal. Lastly, silver is also often seen as a hedge against inflation just like gold, which can be another good reason to invest in it seeing how much money is being printed.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Pan American Silver (PAAS), First Majestic Silver (AG) and SSR Mining (SSRM)

3. Copper

Probably the most commonly used commodity on this list, copper is used in almost every single electrical device or contraption you can think of. Copper is used because it conducts electricity and heat extremely well, making it a core component in and ever more electrified world. The more we as a society focus on electricity to meet our everyday needs, from electric vehicles to the devices we used to read this very post, the more we will rely on copper. It is the same story as with most other commodities, the price has to go up or there will be a shortage of the commodity. When something is so key to our everyday life, it is quite easy to see where this will go. There are also nearly no new tier 1 copper deposits in the world, so bringing new supply online is not nearly as easy as it might be with other commodities.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Freeport McMoran (FCX), Rio Tinto (RIO) and Lundin Mining (LUNMF)

4. Gold

The thing a lot of people see as ‘real money’. Gold, for thousands of years, has been used as something to trade goods for or to back a different type of ‘money’. Even after the abolishment of the gold standard, this view of gold has not changed and it has been on quite the run recently. Gold has increased from roughly 1200 dollars per ounce at the end of 2018 to almost breaching the 2,000 dollar threshold in 2020. Many analysts believe it will not stop here, with figures ranging from 3,000 all the way to 15,000 dollar gold all being quoted. As mentioned before, with the seemingly endless printing of new money and further debasement of fiat currencies all around the world, gold is both a store of value as well as an investment vehicle. The only reason it is fourth on this list, is because uranium, silver and copper all have major industrial uses, instead of just being a store of value. However, that definitely does not mean one should pass on gold, for something that is considered as ‘the only true form of currency’ can prove to be a great investment in an ever more turbulent world.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Barrick Gold (GOLD), Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) and B2Gold (BTG)

5. Lithium

The world is being electrified more and more and just like that benefits copper, silver and uranium, it also benefits lithium. Lithium is silver colored chemical metal that has many uses, but the wide use in battery technology is the reason I am bullish on the material itself. As more electricity is being generated and more renewable energy sources are being connected to the grid, there has to be a way to store part of that energy to make use of it later or in a different way. Advanced battery technology is what makes renewable energy viable on a broader scale, it is what makes all these electric cars able to get on the road and it is a relatively rare metal in high demand. I expect this high demand to increase further as we come to depend more on battery technology.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Albemarle (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Livent (LTHM)",t2_3zxfdhuo,False,,0,False,"Commodity investing, the next great bull market and what 5 commodities can profit from it most",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jun666,False,dark,0.89,,public,96,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,96,,False,,1605474033.0,,[],{},,True,,1605481420.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials markets will provide a better return on invested capital compared other market sectors and will be the main drivers of the next bull market.

As mentioned before, with the seemingly endless printing of new money and further debasement of fiat currencies all around the world, gold is both a store of value as well as an investment vehicle. The only reason it is fourth on this list, is because uranium, silver and copper all have major industrial uses, instead of just being a store of value. However, that definitely does not mean one should pass on gold, for something that is considered as ‘the only true form of currency’ can prove to be a great investment in an ever more turbulent world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Barrick Gold (GOLD), Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) and B2Gold (BTG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lithium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is being electrified more and more and just like that benefits copper, silver and uranium, it also benefits lithium. Lithium is silver colored chemical metal that has many uses, but the wide use in battery technology is the reason I am bullish on the material itself. As more electricity is being generated and more renewable energy sources are being connected to the grid, there has to be a way to store part of that energy to make use of it later or in a different way. Advanced battery technology is what makes renewable energy viable on a broader scale, it is what makes all these electric cars able to get on the road and it is a relatively rare metal in high demand. I expect this high demand to increase further as we come to depend more on battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Albemarle (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Livent (LTHM)&lt;/p&gt;

The RCEP is expected to eliminate a range of tariffs on imports within 20 years.It also includes provisions on intellectual property, telecommunications, financial services, e-commerce and professional services.

Members of the RCEP make up nearly a third of the world's population and account for 29% of global gross domestic product. The new free trade bloc will be bigger than both the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the European Union.

,investing,"I've been invested in $amzn since 2016 and have done round about a 5X on my investment. With Amazon running up to over $3k I've decided to reassess my investment once again, this time focusing on more than just the fundamentals because it's such a unique bunch of businesses under one umbrella.

I took this info and really analyzed it also making a detailed video, and I've personally come to the answer that $amzn is nowhere near done growing.

This is not an extensive list, but here are some of the top areas keeping me attracted to $amzn:

1. Interviewing philosophy. Especially how they have over 3400 ""Bar Raisers"" at the company focused on removing positive/negative bias from interviewing and ensuring they ""Raise the Bar"" with each hire. 

2. How Amazon has stuck to the same principles laid out by Jeff Bezos in 1994. This clearly shows a very deep running corporate culture which is difficult to compete with. 

3. Continued growth mindset, focusing on Customers rather than Stock holders. Even as a stock holder myself this pleases me. There are always stockholder interests and Amazon has always put it on the back burner, reinvesting profits and having a longterm strategy. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to own, as it is clearly still undervalued because of profits seeming to not exists, when its just being reinvested. 

4. Amazon Web Services. This is the largers Cloud Computing provider in the world and tops market share (31%) even over Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud(6%). Last year AWS was 13% of Operating Revenue but 71% of operating income. It's a key business in a market that's spiking. And 3rd party analysts like Gartner puts AWS down as the market leader for the past 10years.

Anyways those are just some high-level elements I covered during my analysis...but...I'm curious to hear others thoughts?

,investing,"Hi all, 

I've been thinking for a while about investing in Japan's railways. For those interested, Japan's railway group (JR Group) provides nearly every train service in Japan. The traded groups are JR West, JR central and JR East. 

Aside from providing the services for public transport, JR Group is an innovator in developing the Shinkansen ""bullet trains"", well known for consistently breaking land-speed records for up to 600 km/h. This technology, although slow in development, may pave the road for future infrastructures around the world. Furthermore, JR not only provides rail services but also owns the land around the rail tracks. This makes for income with regards to services, real estate, hotel, travel and other businesses.

Right now, all 3 of JR Group's stocks sit around half of their pre-covid values. Before that, they were consistently profitable for every year that came before 2020. They are now posting losses for the first time and it might be a while before they see a return to their normal earnings. 

[https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/flash-report/pdf/fr202010.pdf](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/flash-report/pdf/fr202010.pdf)

Posted above is JR West's latest financial report. Although pessimistic in certain regards, the report acknowledges their difficulties and I believe the company itself is under sound management. During the pandemic, they seem to have taken the dip in travels as an opportunity for investing into and expanding their rail infrastructure network. 

The bear in me thinks that the images we have of Japan's conductors stuffing people in trains full of people just so the doors are able to close are over for good. This will likely hurt their profits. Then again, I don't think working from home will take off in Japan as much as it has in the rest of the Western world. Furthermore, a vaccine could cause situations to return to normal in no time. Furthermore, Japan as a whole unfortunately is dealing with a rough economic situation and declining populations. 

The bull in me sees a consistently profitable company that makes great strides in infrastructure technology at a discount of 50%. Japanese train services are head and shoulders above anything in the U.S. or U.K.  and will return to ""normal"" operation (&gt;80% of their normal commuters) by around early 2022. They have multiple irons in their fire regarding income diversification and I find it unlikely that they will go bankrupt any time soon as replacing a semi-nationalized train service will in many cases be more expensive than subsidizing your current one. 

I'm very interested in those that have anything to add. Thank you for reading through this post.

They have multiple irons in their fire regarding income diversification and I find it unlikely that they will go bankrupt any time soon as replacing a semi-nationalized train service will in many cases be more expensive than subsidizing your current one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very interested in those that have anything to add. Thank you for reading through this post. &lt;/p&gt;

I don't really want to push the view that value investing doesn't work anymore; I think that's a red herring. I would love to dig into the idea of ""intangible"" assets being more valuable, yet also that most investors don't understand them.

I believe my entire investment strategy over the past 8 years has been focused on intangible assets that end up generating large amounts of revenue for companies, but only after years of investment. These include data assets, advertising models fuelled by eyeballs, or enablement of marketplaces (e.g., Shopify, Airbnb, SEA Group, etc.). 

The way I tend to approach intangible investments is to answer ""yes"" to all of the following questions:

1. Does the company have an effective product that *some* people (i.e., a small current market) consider ""best in the market""?
2. If the product moves from *some* people buying it to *most* people buying it, will the company 10x its market cap?
3. Are there current players in the space that are 10x bigger than the company? This shows me that it's possible to displace/disrupt current leaders with a new product and strategy and actually capture a massive market. Think: Netflix in its early days (vs. Blockbuster), think Shopify on its IPO day vs. PayPal, Ebay, etc...
4. Do I believe the management team and founders could execute on this?

There are other signals to look for; if I'm right 1/3 of the time and make 10x on those companies, while losing on everyone else, the portfolio can still 3x itself...

U.S. stocks rose on Friday as investors bet again on stocks that would benefit from a potentially effective vaccine and economic recovery next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded higher by 452 points, or 1.6%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.5%, while the techy-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8%. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap stocks, jumped more than 2% to an intraday record, and was on pace for its first all-time closing high since August 2018.

Shares of Disney gained 2%. Shares of Carnival Corp., United Airlines and Boeing all rose, capping big gains for the week. At the sector level, energy and industrials rose 3.9% and 1.9%, respectively, to lead the S&amp;P 500 higher. Financials and materials were also up more than 1%.

“This week’s positive vaccine news is a game-changer in our view, as it allows the market to look through the recent surge in COVID-19 cases to the impending end of the pandemic and broader reopening of the economy,” wrote Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan’s head of macro quantitative and derivatives strategy, who was among the first to call the market’s turn in March.

The Dow gained 4% for the week after Pfizer’s news on Monday that the vaccine it is developing with BioNTech was more than 90% effective in a trial.

,investing,"Apologies for the slightly clickbaity title, I wasn't sure how to best formulate the question.

Let me start by saying that I'm not trying to subtly push my point of view onto others in the form of a question. As an outsider that is currently studying the dynamics of the world of investing with the goal of possibly getting in it in the future, I'm genuinely asking what people more experienced than I think about this.

I very often see people discussing the ""true value"" of a company. This is usually done, as far as I can tell, using one of a number of stock valuation methods. What some people refer to as ""fundamental analysis"". I've read my share of articles on [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com) so I think I've got an at least superficial understanding of how this works etc.

However, I find myself wondering *why* this matters at all. On the surface it should be obvious: owning a stock amounts to owning a share of a company, and obviously, you would want to know whether what you are paying reflects the actual value of what you are getting. At the same time, I'd wager that for the majority of people the only real value of owning a stock is the potential gains that can be made when selling it in the future. From this point of view, why does it matter what the ""real value"" of the company behind the stock is? After all, even assuming I know the ""real value"" of company X's share is $10, if I have reason to believe I'll be able to sell that share for $200 in a month, buying it now at $100 is a bargain, regardless of how overpriced it is.

Now, if all investors were to religiously follow stock valuation techniques, relying on it for their investing strategy, it would then make sense to use such value as a baseline, because we should then expect the stock's price to stabilise to such value in the long run. I would submit that, even in this scenario, such ""real value"" of a company would only be relevant for the average investor because other people follow it, not because that's the ""true value"" that the shares you are buying have for you at any given time, but I guess one can disregard this point as being nitpicky.

But here's the thing: the market, at least at a cursory glance, *does not* look rational to me, and it does not look like many stocks' prices actually reflect their ""true value"" as derived from fundamental analysis. It mostly seems to me that prices fluctuate due to news stories. Granted, the real financials of a company *do* affect the price, to some degree, but that's because these financials generate a specific type of news story (profits lower/higher than expectations, buy/sell!). 

So all of this brings me to the question: is there any actual empirical evidence that stocks' prices are directly tied to the real companies' valuations, rather than being directly tied to news stories, and thus only *indirectly* to the real valuations? And if so, by what amount? This is the sort of thing that I think isn't very easy to gauge based only on individuals' personal experience (though I'd also be interested in that), so I'm hoping there is some actual statistical analysis that has been performed to assess this sort of thing.",t2_7iixjnr1,False,,0,False,Do companies' valuations really matter?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ju6do6,False,dark,0.58,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605406458.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the slightly clickbaity title, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how to best formulate the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Key takeaways:

* Overall average return of 9.9%, with an equal weighted return of 11%. If you picked a stock from this list at random, you would have a 44% chance of a return greater than 10%
* Highest returning pick: Nio Inc (NIO) at 260% flagged by /u/Carrera_GT, /u/makesalotofmoney, /u/Charlie_Brown364
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen a return of 12.7%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 18.6%
* If you had invested in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 27.4%

See below for takeaways after ~3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you can view a visual version here: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall average return of 9.9%, with an equal weighted return of 11%. If you picked a stock from this list at random, you would have a 44% chance of a return greater than 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highest returning pick: Nio Inc (NIO) at 260% flagged by &lt;a href=""/u/Carrera_GT""&gt;/u/Carrera_GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/makesalotofmoney""&gt;/u/makesalotofmoney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/Charlie_Brown364""&gt;/u/Charlie_Brown364&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen a return of 12.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 18.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you had invested in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 27.4%&lt;/li&gt;

I watched Tesla go from 300 to 700, to 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000+. Since 300$ everyone was saying it's way overvalued and will crash big time. It kept going. 

How is NIO different? It's a good EV company, backed by the government. 

\- EV marked is growing stronger day by day. In Europe it's already hefty fines for companies not selling enough green cars  
\- In Norway in October more than 60% of new registered cars were electric   
\- Chinese government emphasises a lot on environment last few years  
\- Those Chinese EVs get good reviews and anticipated on European marked  
\- My guess, Biden will limit trade war with China and make way for green power/EVs

With other words, EV is both present and future. NIO, NIU, XPENG, LI can capture Chinese marked and get a good share European/US marked.

Paired together with cheaper production in China and government behind their back (NIO), it seems like a winning receipt?   
XPENG got Baba behind them, not bad neither.  
NIU may capture huge scooter market so popular in all Asian countries

I need to perform a risk adjusted performance evaluation for a university assignment (Portfolio management class) , I have monthly series returns for two portfolios and a benchmark (for 10 years) and the assignment is to calculate the risk adjusted returns such as alpha, sharp ratio and Traynor, and then allocate among the two portfolios.

my question is which risk free rate should I use ? I checked the daily treasury yield curve rates and I was thinking of using the 10- year as it matches the investment horizon as well as it is more liquid than 20-y and 30-y (correct me if I am wrong), the other question is how can I convert this daily returns to monthly in order to calculate the excess return on a monthly basis ?

1. NIO is a startup and currently at a growth phase. Go back to your fundamental and tell me, is NIO currently overprice or severely overpriced
2. Large Total Addressable Market
3. BaaS is attractive especially taxi fleet and robotaxi in the future
4. Chinese government backing (A reason why everyone is investing in it right?)

Cons:

1. Dependent on government backing out from funding. (Come on its possible)
2. I've been to China, there are Tesla car everywhere (Status). Foreign cars are perceived better there.
3. It may be profitable, but not so soon. OR NEVER since they have high capex businesses. There are many firm going bankrupt as a reason for that
4. Their the firstmoover for Baas but it is not an advantage... It is easily copied and follow by the rest of its competitors
5. Priced to perfection
6. It is reliant on third party like JAC motors. How are they going to get their own factory? How much dilution is it going to take to raise money for a factory to keep up with the demand? Can we assume that NIO's factory will be as good as JAC motors?
7. Risk of BaaS station catching fire due to poor quality in the long run. It is going to be a pain to keep having new batteries as it is costly. The only way to preserve quality in the long run is to always use new batteries to swap the vehicles (Which cost tons of money.)

In the event whereby cars starts catching fire due to poor maintenance of batteries, the brand is going to get tarnish.

8) Are quality assurance audited?

,investing,"Back in September 2019, Michael Burry predicted an index fund bubble. Since I invest index funds and write about them with relish, I was intrigued. But I quickly moved on.

Then another headline caught my eye. It was an episode of Odd Lots podcast titled,  [**“Why Passive Investing Might Be Distorting the Market.”**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-07/why-passive-investing-might-be-distorting-the-market-podcast)   I immediately listened to the episode, featuring investor and fund manager Mike Green. And then I listened again. Considering a lot of my net worth is currently tied up in index funds, I want to understand why some people think index funds are fools’ gold.

So today, I’m going to play devil’s advocate and talk about both sides of the conversation. Is there an index fund bubble? A market crash around the corner? Or is passive investing still the winning strategy it’s always been?

Below, you’ll find compelling arguments from investors Mike Green and Michael Burry, who both say there is a bubble. Then I’ll follow up with comments from financial analyst Ben Carlson and portfolio manager Ben Felix, both of whom see no bubble . It’s #TeamMike vs. #TeamBen. I’ll also pull some soundbites from Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who now produces financial videos with a silky British accent. And then I’ll add in my own thoughts at the end.

# Quick reminder: what’s an index fund?

An index fund owns a wide assortment of assets (e.g. stocks), and owns those assets in proportion to their market share. Uh…that’s a lot of FinSpeak. Let’s break it down.

For an example, let’s look at an S&amp;P 500 index fund. An S&amp;P 500 index fund would own all of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since Apple and Microsoft each make up about 5% of the S&amp;P 500, this index fund would be comprised of about 5% Apple and 5% Microsoft. But Chipotle would only compose about 0.08% of the index, because it’s 0.08% of the S&amp;P. In this way, the index fund is benchmarked to the S&amp;P, like a shadow that follows all of the body’s movements.

Similarly, a “total stock market fund” would own every stock in the market. There are tons of options in the index fund world.

Let’s get into the arguments that claim indexing is now in a bubble.

# Part I – Bubble! – “The tail is now wagging the dog”

One of Mike Green’s first points on Odd Lots is this: the original idea behind indexing is that active traders and actively managed funds will dictate how the market behaves, and that a small number of passive investors (e.g. index funds) can simply go along for the ride. The large majority active traders are the dog; the minority passive investors are the tail. The dog does what it wants. The tail only follows.

If dogs don’t do it for you, I like the boat analogy. Think of actively managed funds and active traders as large cruise liners and passive investors as a small canoe. The cruise liner picks its course. The canoe ropes onto the cruise liner and gets a free ride. The cruise liner doesn’t notice the small canoe’s drag whatsoever; its course is unaffected. This big-small relationship is the original assumption behind passive investing. Market behavior is dictated by the active majority, and the passive minority gets a free ride.

However, asserts Green, we now live in a paradigm where active and passive investing are too close in size. Therefore, the fundamental assumption no longer rings true.

Millions of Average Janes and Joes–individual investors–are using index funds to invest huge portions of their income and savings. After all, that’s how many 401(k)s and their non-American equivalents are set up. Green points out how recent U.S. legislation changes are pushing 401(k)s and passive investing even further into the mainstream.

Passive investing is no longer the “small tail.” It’s no longer the canoe. It’s now a fairly large boat, and the active management cruise liner is impacted by towing such a large passive boat.

The past 30 years have seen index funds grow and grow. Index fund inflows are the “single largest transactors in the market by far” Therefore, by definition, they are not passive. Index funds have to be influencing the market. What might this influence look like?

# Passive investing influences the market

Let’s go back to our S&amp;P 500 index fund from before. The S&amp;P 500 went up \~30% in 2019. Where does this gain come from?

Some of it probably comes from fundamental growth in the S&amp;P companies. They’re doing better! Active investors respond by saying, “If the company is better, then these stocks are now worth more!”

Alternatively, what happens when millions of individual investors put their retirement savings into S&amp;P 500 index funds? It’s simple supply and demand. Joe and Jane are increasing the demand for S&amp;P stocks, therefore the price will increase.

When Joe and Jane were the “small canoe,” their demand didn’t affect the market. But these passive investors are no longer “just along for the ride.” They are actively impacting the ride. Last year’s 30% price increase is not based only on fundamental growth. Instead, the Average Janes and Joes are artificially increasing the price of the S&amp;P 500 via their demand for index funds.

# The effects of “index inclusion”

What about “Company 501;” that is, the first company not in the S&amp;P 500? Well, it does not receive the benefits of being a part of the S&amp;P 500 index funds. It does not receive the demand that occurs from inclusion in that index fund, and this exclusion affects Company 501’s price.

Mike Green says that historical data clearly shows this growing impact on asset values–it’s called “index inclusion.” This is true for all sorts of index funds. They include some stocks, exclude others, and there’s a recognizable delineation between those included and excluded.

Green says there’s a “distinct and permanent shift in the valuation and price levels associated with these securities” when they are included or ejected from an index. Companies inside of indices are receiving more attention than they fundamentally deserve. Companies outside of indices, therefore, are getting the cold shoulder. This lack of true valuation is one of the formative factors of a bubble.

# “Fire!” in a theater

In the past 40 years, passive investing has done nothing but grow. But eventually, that growth will end. Individual investors will retire. Withdrawals will take place. What happens when you take the money out?

At that point, Green states that the artificial inflation of index funds will cease, and quickly turn south. As more retail investors sell, prices will drop. When investors see prices dropping, they’ll get scared and sell more. The vicious cycle will continue–sell, drop, sell more, drop more–into a index fund crash. It’ll be an old-fashioned bank run.

Or, as Nicholas Nassim Taleb has written, “the market is like a large movie theater with a small door.” If everyone is looking to get out, the only way to do so is to offer the doorman a better price than the other people. Prices will plummet. Pop goes the index fund bubble.

# Is it the British accent?

Raoul Pal looks the part, sounds the part, and produces his videos while sitting in front of monitors chock full of financial data. My bulls\*\*\* detector is whirring to life, but something about that accent is just so factual.

Pal’s argument is that baby boomers–through no fault of their own–have been dumping too much money into passive funds (pensions, 401(k)’s, etc). When they start selling en masse–which will happen soon!–then pop goes the index fund bubble.

There are 76 million baby boomers in the U.S., and their average age is now 65 years old. The wave of retirees is about to crest. And when they start to pull money out for retirement, we will see the large theater/small door issue. Prices will plummet.

But, says Pal, index funds aren’t the only issue. Boomers will also face issues trying to sell their houses. They’ll have issues trying to sell their material goods. Baby Boomers were such prolific consumers that the economy will be overwrought will all their stuff, and prices everywhere will fall. Growth will cease as markets are flooded with goods. A vicious cycle will ensue.

And then “the doom loop of corporate debt will get ignited.” Oh no, not a doom loop! In short, says Pal, corporations have recently gotten into the habit of:

1. Borrowing money (this is the corporate debt)
2. Buying shares of their own stock—a.k.a “stock buy backs”
3. …which drives the price of their stock higher (P.S. this is an artificial price increase)
4. …which makes the company appear more valuable, and usually lets the biggest stockholders (e.g. the executives) get extra rich

And Pal’s right. Corporations have been gluttons for their own stocks in recent years. Just read about Apple’s buyback tactics.

Eventually, these corporations will have to pay back their debts. And their artificial valuations will come back to Earth. Stock prices will plummet. Indexes and pension funds will plummet. And Baby Boomers’ selling will cause further pricing drops.

And thus, claims Pal, the third Baby Boomer crash will occur. And every good story has the symmetry of threes.

# Problems with Pal

My core issue with Pal is that he’s as much a story teller as he is fact teller. And therefore, it’s hard to tell if he’s selling olive oil or snake oil.

For example, this sounds impressive: “The baby boomers accumulated the greatest concentration of wealth the world has ever seen. And they’ll destroy it too.” Whoa! Rise and fall. The double-edged sword. The boomer giveth, and the boomer taketh away.

Pal provides facts to back up his claims. But most of his facts are arguable at best.

The 2000 Dot Com bubble? It happened because Boomers flooded the stock market with their investments, says Pal. And then “everything got dashed on the rocks, as those markets collapsed.”

The Baby Boomers–then age 45 on average–turned to real estate, says Pal. Can you guess what happened next? The 2008 Subprime Mortgage and Financial Crisis! Baby Boomers are so many in number, says Pal, that their sum-total behavior can’t help but create bubbles.

After 2000 and 2008, the Boomers were worried about their retirement savings, goes Pal’s argument. So now they’ve got to take risk, and they were forced to do so in the stock market. Well, what’s the easiest way to invest in stocks? Through passive investing! And as we’ve now learned twice–according the Pal–where the Boomer money goes, a bubble will soon follow.

It’s a nice story. It has symmetry. It has foreshadowing. It’s narrated with a silky British accent.

But that doesn’t mean it has an iota of truth. Euphoric day-trading of “.com” companies led to the 2000 Dot Com bubble. Passive investing is the exact opposite of that kind of behavior! Perhaps the money is coming from some of the same people, but that’s not evidence for the existence of an index fund bubble. Pal is grasping at straws.

# Michael Burry: Big Short to Big Bubble

Michael Burry is an investor and hedge fund manager who correctly foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, and managed to make a boat-load of money for himself and his customers through his correct prediction. If you’ve seen the movie The Big Short, Michael Burry is played by Christian Bale.

Burry’s argument for an index fund bubble is a less scary than Green’s, and certainly less apocalyptic than Pal’s.

Burry’s claim is that indexing has caused an artificial bubble that’s inflating stocks inside the index, and thus leaving stocks outside the index ripe for the picking. It’s the “index inclusion” argument again.

But where Green sees a dangerous bubble, Burry sees more of an opportunity. Ready for another metaphor?

Imagine a pair of identical twin basketball all-stars. Everything about them is the same, including their skills. Except that one twin plays college ball for Duke–he’s always on TV–while the other plays for Harvard–a good academic school, but not a basketball Mecca.

The average basketball fan would be biased towards the Duke player. He’s on a better team, he gets more media coverage, and has more post-season success. The average fan would certainly believe that the Duke twin has better long-term prospects, and therefore would deserve a bigger professional contract.

But since I built this strawman hypothetical, you and I know the truth! The two twins have the same exact skill set. Therefore, signing the Harvard twin at his lower price would actually be quite the financially efficient move.

Michael Burry’s claim is that this is what’s happening with passive investing. Near-identical companies are being over- or under-valued due to their index inclusion or exclusion.

Stocks that are inside of index funds are like the Duke twin–they are being over-valued simply because of where they are. While stocks not in the index are like Harvard twin–they are under-valued, and therefore should be targeted by smart people looking to make more money.

In my opinion, this is less of a “index fund bubble” and more of an “anti-index opportunity.”

Burry is simply saying, “There’s an inefficiency here, I’ve discovered it, and I plan on making money off it. P.S.–come invest with me so we can both make money together.”

Good work, Mike! Go exploit that inefficiency!

# Price Discovery is becoming fragile

Burry’s second claim is that price discovery is becoming fragile. “Price discovery” is a fancy term for “buyers and sellers determining a price where they’re willing to make a deal.”

Think about Craigslist. Someone wants $200 for a used snowblower. Snow?! Yes, in Rochester it helps to have a snowblower. So, you take a look at the snowblower and counteroffer $150. The owner haggles back to $175…and you have a deal! That’s price discovery.

Typically, stock market price discovery involves many buyers and sellers conducting detailed analyses of a company’s holdings and profits and cash flows–all of the fundamental business metrics.

But passive investing doesn’t care about those fundamental metrics. Instead, passive investing simply follows the leader. It assumes that others in the market have already done the fundamental research, and that the current price of a stock is “right.”

It’s a little bit like saying, “The last Craigslist used snowblower went for $200, so I’ll buy the next one for $200 sight unseen.” Are you sure you want to trust the last buyer and seller? What if they were dopes? Don’t you want to look at the snowblower and make a decision for yourself?

Since passive investing doesn’t rely on price discovery, Burry argues that prices are now dangerously skewed from what traditional price discovery would suggest. This cannot go on forever, and eventually the prices will snap back to where they fundamentally belong.

Or, you could say, the index fund bubble will pop. This, Burry says, is very similar to how housing and CDO pricing behavior malfunctioned before the 2008 crisis. It will be a painful, painful snap.

# Part II – The other side: Index funds are fine

While I appreciate the logic behind Misters Green and Burry and Pal, there’s plenty of good money still betting on index funds’ future success. Let’s start with [**Ben Carlson**](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/). . Ben is financial analyst, author and blogger (nice!), and podcast host. I’m a big fan of A Wealth of Common Sense (the blog) and Animal Spirits (the podcast). Thanks for sharing all the good work, Ben.

Anyway, what does Ben have to say about the index fund bubble and passive investing?

# The tail is not wagging the dog.

First, let’s get back to dogs and tails and boats. Carlson writes, “Index funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies.” While this is a growing number–it was 3.3% in 2002 and 6.8% in 2009–passive investing is neither a majority nor plurality.

If we combine all exchange traded funds and all mutual funds, that percentage rises to about 35% ownership of all shares. That means that active investors–the dog–own at least 65% of the equity market, and therefore are still wagging the tail. All is well in the dog/boat metaphor universe, says Carlson.

# Bias! Bias! Read all about it!

Another of Carlson’s arguments is that active investing, by nature, is biased against passive investing. Passive is stealing active’s business share, and now active is biting back.

Passive investing shadows what the active investors are doing. But rather than spending money on research and trades, passive investing keeps expenses–and fees–to a minimum. Passive has all the profits of active investing, but none of the costs: ipso facto, passive investing is better. And the active investors don’t like it! The “index fund bubble” is their propaganda technique.

Besides, let’s consider any and all claims that passive investing is doing something “wrong.” Logically speaking, anything that passive investing is “doing wrong” first has to be done by active investors.

You can’t blame your shadow for flipping you the middle finger–the shadow only copies the source. Similarly, passive investing only copies what active investors are doing. It’s a simple argument in logic.

# The price discovery argument

Price discovery is a cop-out, says Carlson. There is way more trading occurring today than most times in the stock market’s history. In the book Index Revolution, author Charley Ellis writes that about 95% of all trades today are done by active managers–there’s plenty of opportunity for price discovery. It’s all about trading volume.

This means that the prices aren’t skewed. The prices aren’t a stretched rubber band, ready to snap back. There’s no index fund bubble, waiting to pop. Instead, the active investors are setting the prices and price discovery is healthy.

# So what’s Michael Burry worried about?

Besides, Carlson says, when else in life do we expect individuals to actively partake in price discovery? Do you haggle with the grocery cashier about the cost of oranges? No! All over our economy, prices are set and individual consumers simply choose to buy, or not. They don’t barter or bargain.

I’m not sure I agree with Ben’s point here. It’s true: we don’t haggle at grocery stores. Instead we’re presented with Hobson’s choice–we either take it, or leave it. If you don’t want to pay $12 for a bag of oranges, you don’t have to.

But are people thinking about Hobson’s choice when they passively invest in index funds? I don’t think so. I think a lot of people are “blindly” putting their bi-weekly 401(k) contributions into index funds, regardless of the price. There’s not much “take it, or leave it” going on. It’s just “take it.”

My conclusion: index investors might be blindly buying in, but they’re still buying at a price that was intelligently discovered through the fundamental analyses of active investors.

# Ben Felix from YouTube

[**Ben Felix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0pJh8mFk0) is a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, and popular creator of YouTube financial/investment videos.

I really like one of Felix’s foundational arguments against the idea of the bubble. That idea is: assets under management do not set prices; instead, trading sets prices.

So Green and Burry should not be asking, “How much money is in indexes?” Instead, the question should be, “How much trading is done by indexing?” This means that the size of the boats doesn’t matter. In fact, it means the boat metaphor doesn’t really make sense.

So let’s relate it back to the quote from Charley Ellis: 95% of all trades today are done by active managers. That means that price discovery is dominated by active trading. And it means that there shouldn’t be any bubble driven by price discovery.

Blackrock, another investment management firm, estimates that for every $1 of passive trades, there are $22 of active trades. Again, this points to the same conclusion: there is no issue with price discovery.

# Some ideas from the academics

Felix quotes a couple serious economics papers–one by [**Fama/French**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=502605), another from [**Palia/Sokolinksi.**](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Paper_P%26S_Darius.pdf)

Fama &amp; French came to the conclusion that it doesn’t take much active investing to create an efficient (i.e. non-bubble) market. Passive investing, they say, is pushing bad active managers out of the market. And those who remain? Only the skilled active managers. It’s survival of the fittest. Culling the weak should only make the market more efficient. More efficient = better price discovery = no bubble.

Palia and Sokolinski have a really interesting theory. In brief, they claim that index funds drive down the cost of short selling, which makes short selling more efficient, and that leads to better price discovery.

They start with the simple truth that index funds hold onto lots of stocks. And since the supply of stocks is high, index funds can easily lend out those stocks to short sellers (people betting that a stock will go down). The short seller pays the index fund a small fee, which gets passed onto the passive investor in the form of low costs.

However, since there are so many index funds out there, the short sellers have many different options of where they borrow stocks from. With high supply comes low prices. They can find their short sources very cheaply. This makes the cost of shorting go down.

And thus, conclude Palia and Sokolinski, passive investing is creating a more efficient market for short sellers, and a more efficient market leads to better price discovery.

# Part III – Home-grown arguments and takeaways

Now that you’ve heard the smart people talk, let me bless you with my pro-index ideas.

First, index investing is self-corrective.

To wit, let’s take another look at Michael Burry’s argument: “passive investing has an inefficiency in undervaluing non-indexed companies, and I plan on taking advantage of that.”

If Burry is correct, then more active managers will follow his lead and make their money. And right behind them will be their shadow a.k.a. passive investing. The market is a self-correcting system, where money flows towards the best values. Passive investing simply follows that flow of money.

If passive gets too influential, then the smart active managers will exploit the problem. Inefficiencies will balance themselves out in the long-term. And passive investing is a long-term technique.

Second, it’s easy to avoid the pitfalls of index inclusion.

Index funds don’t have to exclude stocks. Many investment managers (like Fidelity and Vanguard) offer total market index funds. They include high and mighty S&amp;P companies and all of the “company 501’s” out there that might be excluded from other index funds.

Therefore–if there is an index inclusion bubble–the total market index funds own both sides of that bubble.

A total market fund would only be exposed to a bubble that includes entire asset classes. For example, one could claim that stocks in their entirety are overvalued, but that commodities are undervalued. Therefore, a total U.S. stock market index fund would still expose you the bad outcomes of bursting bubble!

If this concerns you, then diversify your index investing via a lazy portfolio. There are indexes that track bond markets, international markets, different sized companies, commodities, REITs, etc. You can spread out your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce your risk.

# Takeaways

Green and Burry both make good points. Pal tells a nice story. I’m really glad I took some time to understand those ideas. Carlson and Felix support the ideas I’ve always heard: the wisdom of people like Jack Bogle and Burton Malkiel. What actions am I taking after all this conversation?

Reading. Lots more reading. I want to learn more about Mike Green, Michael Burry, and their anti-passive compatriots. After all–they did compel me to type up 4000 words of arguments that go against my investing strategy. But I also want to remind myself of the reasons why I started indexing in the first place: Malkiel, Bogle, and people like Ben Carlson and Ben Felix.

But I will be staying my course, at least for now. I have not been convinced to move away from indexing, or that there’s an index fund bubble. Indexes still float my boat, and I think the bubble argument has more bark than bite. I’m in it for the long run. I do not think hand-picking individual stocks is the way to go.

Since I invest index funds and write about them with relish, I was intrigued. But I quickly moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then another headline caught my eye. It was an episode of Odd Lots podcast titled,  &lt;a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-07/why-passive-investing-might-be-distorting-the-market-podcast""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Why Passive Investing Might Be Distorting the Market.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   I immediately listened to the episode, featuring investor and fund manager Mike Green. And then I listened again. Considering a lot of my net worth is currently tied up in index funds, I want to understand why some people think index funds are fools’ gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today, I’m going to play devil’s advocate and talk about both sides of the conversation. Is there an index fund bubble? A market crash around the corner? Or is passive investing still the winning strategy it’s always been?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, you’ll find compelling arguments from investors Mike Green and Michael Burry, who both say there is a bubble. Then I’ll follow up with comments from financial analyst Ben Carlson and portfolio manager Ben Felix, both of whom see no bubble . It’s #TeamMike vs. #TeamBen. I’ll also pull some soundbites from Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who now produces financial videos with a silky British accent. And then I’ll add in my own thoughts at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder: what’s an index fund?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An index fund owns a wide assortment of assets (e.g. stocks), and owns those assets in proportion to their market share. Uh…that’s a lot of FinSpeak. Let’s break it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example, let’s look at an S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund. An S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund would own all of the stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500. Since Apple and Microsoft each make up about 5% of the S&amp;amp;P 500, this index fund would be comprised of about 5% Apple and 5% Microsoft. But Chipotle would only compose about 0.08% of the index, because it’s 0.08% of the S&amp;amp;P. In this way, the index fund is benchmarked to the S&amp;amp;P, like a shadow that follows all of the body’s movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a “total stock market fund” would own every stock in the market. There are tons of options in the index fund world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get into the arguments that claim indexing is now in a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part I – Bubble! – “The tail is now wagging the dog”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Mike Green’s first points on Odd Lots is this: the original idea behind indexing is that active traders and actively managed funds will dictate how the market behaves, and that a small number of passive investors (e.g. index funds) can simply go along for the ride. The large majority active traders are the dog; the minority passive investors are the tail. The dog does what it wants. The tail only follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If dogs don’t do it for you, I like the boat analogy. Think of actively managed funds and active traders as large cruise liners and passive investors as a small canoe. The cruise liner picks its course. The canoe ropes onto the cruise liner and gets a free ride. The cruise liner doesn’t notice the small canoe’s drag whatsoever; its course is unaffected. This big-small relationship is the original assumption behind passive investing. Market behavior is dictated by the active majority, and the passive minority gets a free ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, asserts Green, we now live in a paradigm where active and passive investing are too close in size. Therefore, the fundamental assumption no longer rings true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millions of Average Janes and Joes–individual investors–are using index funds to invest huge portions of their income and savings. After all, that’s how many 401(k)s and their non-American equivalents are set up. Green points out how recent U.S. legislation changes are pushing 401(k)s and passive investing even further into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive investing is no longer the “small tail.” It’s no longer the canoe. It’s now a fairly large boat, and the active management cruise liner is impacted by towing such a large passive boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 30 years have seen index funds grow and grow. Index fund inflows are the “single largest transactors in the market by far” Therefore, by definition, they are not passive. Index funds have to be influencing the market. What might this influence look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Passive investing influences the market&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to our S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund from before. The S&amp;amp;P 500 went up ~30% in 2019. Where does this gain come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it probably comes from fundamental growth in the S&amp;amp;P companies. They’re doing better! Active investors respond by saying, “If the company is better, then these stocks are now worth more!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, what happens when millions of individual investors put their retirement savings into S&amp;amp;P 500 index funds? It’s simple supply and demand. Joe and Jane are increasing the demand for S&amp;amp;P stocks, therefore the price will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Joe and Jane were the “small canoe,” their demand didn’t affect the market. But these passive investors are no longer “just along for the ride.” They are actively impacting the ride. Last year’s 30% price increase is not based only on fundamental growth. Instead, the Average Janes and Joes are artificially increasing the price of the S&amp;amp;P 500 via their demand for index funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The effects of “index inclusion”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about “Company 501;” that is, the first company not in the S&amp;amp;P 500? Well, it does not receive the benefits of being a part of the S&amp;amp;P 500 index funds. It does not receive the demand that occurs from inclusion in that index fund, and this exclusion affects Company 501’s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Green says that historical data clearly shows this growing impact on asset values–it’s called “index inclusion.” This is true for all sorts of index funds. They include some stocks, exclude others, and there’s a recognizable delineation between those included and excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green says there’s a “distinct and permanent shift in the valuation and price levels associated with these securities” when they are included or ejected from an index. Companies inside of indices are receiving more attention than they fundamentally deserve. Companies outside of indices, therefore, are getting the cold shoulder. This lack of true valuation is one of the formative factors of a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;“Fire!” in a theater&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 40 years, passive investing has done nothing but grow. But eventually, that growth will end. Individual investors will retire. Withdrawals will take place. What happens when you take the money out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, Green states that the artificial inflation of index funds will cease, and quickly turn south. As more retail investors sell, prices will drop. When investors see prices dropping, they’ll get scared and sell more. The vicious cycle will continue–sell, drop, sell more, drop more–into a index fund crash. It’ll be an old-fashioned bank run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, as Nicholas Nassim Taleb has written, “the market is like a large movie theater with a small door.” If everyone is looking to get out, the only way to do so is to offer the doorman a better price than the other people. Prices will plummet. Pop goes the index fund bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Is it the British accent?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raoul Pal looks the part, sounds the part, and produces his videos while sitting in front of monitors chock full of financial data. My bulls*** detector is whirring to life, but something about that accent is just so factual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pal’s argument is that baby boomers–through no fault of their own–have been dumping too much money into passive funds (pensions, 401(k)’s, etc). When they start selling en masse–which will happen soon!–then pop goes the index fund bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 76 million baby boomers in the U.S., and their average age is now 65 years old. The wave of retirees is about to crest. And when they start to pull money out for retirement, we will see the large theater/small door issue. Prices will plummet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, says Pal, index funds aren’t the only issue. Boomers will also face issues trying to sell their houses. They’ll have issues trying to sell their material goods. Baby Boomers were such prolific consumers that the economy will be overwrought will all their stuff, and prices everywhere will fall. Growth will cease as markets are flooded with goods. A vicious cycle will ensue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then “the doom loop of corporate debt will get ignited.” Oh no, not a doom loop! In short, says Pal, corporations have recently gotten into the habit of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrowing money (this is the corporate debt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying shares of their own stock—a.k.a “stock buy backs”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…which drives the price of their stock higher (P.S. this is an artificial price increase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…which makes the company appear more valuable, and usually lets the biggest stockholders (e.g. the executives) get extra rich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Pal’s right. Corporations have been gluttons for their own stocks in recent years. Just read about Apple’s buyback tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these corporations will have to pay back their debts. And their artificial valuations will come back to Earth. Stock prices will plummet. Indexes and pension funds will plummet. And Baby Boomers’ selling will cause further pricing drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, claims Pal, the third Baby Boomer crash will occur. And every good story has the symmetry of threes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Problems with Pal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My core issue with Pal is that he’s as much a story teller as he is fact teller. And therefore, it’s hard to tell if he’s selling olive oil or snake oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, this sounds impressive: “The baby boomers accumulated the greatest concentration of wealth the world has ever seen. And they’ll destroy it too.” Whoa! Rise and fall. The double-edged sword. The boomer giveth, and the boomer taketh away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pal provides facts to back up his claims. But most of his facts are arguable at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2000 Dot Com bubble? It happened because Boomers flooded the stock market with their investments, says Pal. And then “everything got dashed on the rocks, as those markets collapsed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baby Boomers–then age 45 on average–turned to real estate, says Pal. Can you guess what happened next? The 2008 Subprime Mortgage and Financial Crisis! Baby Boomers are so many in number, says Pal, that their sum-total behavior can’t help but create bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2000 and 2008, the Boomers were worried about their retirement savings, goes Pal’s argument. So now they’ve got to take risk, and they were forced to do so in the stock market. Well, what’s the easiest way to invest in stocks? Through passive investing! And as we’ve now learned twice–according the Pal–where the Boomer money goes, a bubble will soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice story. It has symmetry. It has foreshadowing. It’s narrated with a silky British accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean it has an iota of truth. Euphoric day-trading of “.com” companies led to the 2000 Dot Com bubble. Passive investing is the exact opposite of that kind of behavior! Perhaps the money is coming from some of the same people, but that’s not evidence for the existence of an index fund bubble. Pal is grasping at straws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Michael Burry: Big Short to Big Bubble&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Burry is an investor and hedge fund manager who correctly foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, and managed to make a boat-load of money for himself and his customers through his correct prediction. If you’ve seen the movie The Big Short, Michael Burry is played by Christian Bale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry’s argument for an index fund bubble is a less scary than Green’s, and certainly less apocalyptic than Pal’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry’s claim is that indexing has caused an artificial bubble that’s inflating stocks inside the index, and thus leaving stocks outside the index ripe for the picking. It’s the “index inclusion” argument again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where Green sees a dangerous bubble, Burry sees more of an opportunity. Ready for another metaphor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a pair of identical twin basketball all-stars. Everything about them is the same, including their skills. Except that one twin plays college ball for Duke–he’s always on TV–while the other plays for Harvard–a good academic school, but not a basketball Mecca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average basketball fan would be biased towards the Duke player. He’s on a better team, he gets more media coverage, and has more post-season success. The average fan would certainly believe that the Duke twin has better long-term prospects, and therefore would deserve a bigger professional contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I built this strawman hypothetical, you and I know the truth! The two twins have the same exact skill set. Therefore, signing the Harvard twin at his lower price would actually be quite the financially efficient move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Burry’s claim is that this is what’s happening with passive investing. Near-identical companies are being over- or under-valued due to their index inclusion or exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks that are inside of index funds are like the Duke twin–they are being over-valued simply because of where they are. While stocks not in the index are like Harvard twin–they are under-valued, and therefore should be targeted by smart people looking to make more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is less of a “index fund bubble” and more of an “anti-index opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry is simply saying, “There’s an inefficiency here, I’ve discovered it, and I plan on making money off it. P.S.–come invest with me so we can both make money together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good work, Mike! Go exploit that inefficiency!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Price Discovery is becoming fragile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burry’s second claim is that price discovery is becoming fragile. “Price discovery” is a fancy term for “buyers and sellers determining a price where they’re willing to make a deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about Craigslist. Someone wants $200 for a used snowblower. Snow?! Yes, in Rochester it helps to have a snowblower. So, you take a look at the snowblower and counteroffer $150. The owner haggles back to $175…and you have a deal! That’s price discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, stock market price discovery involves many buyers and sellers conducting detailed analyses of a company’s holdings and profits and cash flows–all of the fundamental business metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But passive investing doesn’t care about those fundamental metrics. Instead, passive investing simply follows the leader. It assumes that others in the market have already done the fundamental research, and that the current price of a stock is “right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit like saying, “The last Craigslist used snowblower went for $200, so I’ll buy the next one for $200 sight unseen.” Are you sure you want to trust the last buyer and seller? What if they were dopes? Don’t you want to look at the snowblower and make a decision for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since passive investing doesn’t rely on price discovery, Burry argues that prices are now dangerously skewed from what traditional price discovery would suggest. This cannot go on forever, and eventually the prices will snap back to where they fundamentally belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you could say, the index fund bubble will pop. This, Burry says, is very similar to how housing and CDO pricing behavior malfunctioned before the 2008 crisis. It will be a painful, painful snap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part II – The other side: Index funds are fine&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I appreciate the logic behind Misters Green and Burry and Pal, there’s plenty of good money still betting on index funds’ future success. Let’s start with &lt;a href=""https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Carlson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. . Ben is financial analyst, author and blogger (nice!), and podcast host. I’m a big fan of A Wealth of Common Sense (the blog) and Animal Spirits (the podcast). Thanks for sharing all the good work, Ben.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what does Ben have to say about the index fund bubble and passive investing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The tail is not wagging the dog.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s get back to dogs and tails and boats. Carlson writes, “Index funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies.” While this is a growing number–it was 3.3% in 2002 and 6.8% in 2009–passive investing is neither a majority nor plurality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we combine all exchange traded funds and all mutual funds, that percentage rises to about 35% ownership of all shares. That means that active investors–the dog–own at least 65% of the equity market, and therefore are still wagging the tail. All is well in the dog/boat metaphor universe, says Carlson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bias! Bias! Read all about it!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of Carlson’s arguments is that active investing, by nature, is biased against passive investing. Passive is stealing active’s business share, and now active is biting back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive investing shadows what the active investors are doing. But rather than spending money on research and trades, passive investing keeps expenses–and fees–to a minimum. Passive has all the profits of active investing, but none of the costs: ipso facto, passive investing is better. And the active investors don’t like it! The “index fund bubble” is their propaganda technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, let’s consider any and all claims that passive investing is doing something “wrong.” Logically speaking, anything that passive investing is “doing wrong” first has to be done by active investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t blame your shadow for flipping you the middle finger–the shadow only copies the source. Similarly, passive investing only copies what active investors are doing. It’s a simple argument in logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The price discovery argument&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price discovery is a cop-out, says Carlson. There is way more trading occurring today than most times in the stock market’s history. In the book Index Revolution, author Charley Ellis writes that about 95% of all trades today are done by active managers–there’s plenty of opportunity for price discovery. It’s all about trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the prices aren’t skewed. The prices aren’t a stretched rubber band, ready to snap back. There’s no index fund bubble, waiting to pop. Instead, the active investors are setting the prices and price discovery is healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;So what’s Michael Burry worried about?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, Carlson says, when else in life do we expect individuals to actively partake in price discovery? Do you haggle with the grocery cashier about the cost of oranges? No! All over our economy, prices are set and individual consumers simply choose to buy, or not. They don’t barter or bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I agree with Ben’s point here. It’s true: we don’t haggle at grocery stores. Instead we’re presented with Hobson’s choice–we either take it, or leave it. If you don’t want to pay $12 for a bag of oranges, you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are people thinking about Hobson’s choice when they passively invest in index funds? I don’t think so. I think a lot of people are “blindly” putting their bi-weekly 401(k) contributions into index funds, regardless of the price. There’s not much “take it, or leave it” going on. It’s just “take it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion: index investors might be blindly buying in, but they’re still buying at a price that was intelligently discovered through the fundamental analyses of active investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ben Felix from YouTube&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0pJh8mFk0""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Felix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, and popular creator of YouTube financial/investment videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like one of Felix’s foundational arguments against the idea of the bubble. That idea is: assets under management do not set prices; instead, trading sets prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Green and Burry should not be asking, “How much money is in indexes?” Instead, the question should be, “How much trading is done by indexing?” This means that the size of the boats doesn’t matter. In fact, it means the boat metaphor doesn’t really make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s relate it back to the quote from Charley Ellis: 95% of all trades today are done by active managers. That means that price discovery is dominated by active trading. And it means that there shouldn’t be any bubble driven by price discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackrock, another investment management firm, estimates that for every $1 of passive trades, there are $22 of active trades. Again, this points to the same conclusion: there is no issue with price discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Some ideas from the academics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felix quotes a couple serious economics papers–one by &lt;a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=502605""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fama/French&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another from &lt;a href=""https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Paper_P%26S_Darius.pdf""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palia/Sokolinksi.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fama &amp;amp; French came to the conclusion that it doesn’t take much active investing to create an efficient (i.e. non-bubble) market. Passive investing, they say, is pushing bad active managers out of the market. And those who remain? Only the skilled active managers. It’s survival of the fittest. Culling the weak should only make the market more efficient. More efficient = better price discovery = no bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palia and Sokolinski have a really interesting theory. In brief, they claim that index funds drive down the cost of short selling, which makes short selling more efficient, and that leads to better price discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They start with the simple truth that index funds hold onto lots of stocks. And since the supply of stocks is high, index funds can easily lend out those stocks to short sellers (people betting that a stock will go down). The short seller pays the index fund a small fee, which gets passed onto the passive investor in the form of low costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since there are so many index funds out there, the short sellers have many different options of where they borrow stocks from. With high supply comes low prices. They can find their short sources very cheaply. This makes the cost of shorting go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, conclude Palia and Sokolinski, passive investing is creating a more efficient market for short sellers, and a more efficient market leads to better price discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Part III – Home-grown arguments and takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve heard the smart people talk, let me bless you with my pro-index ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, index investing is self-corrective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wit, let’s take another look at Michael Burry’s argument: “passive investing has an inefficiency in undervaluing non-indexed companies, and I plan on taking advantage of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Burry is correct, then more active managers will follow his lead and make their money. And right behind them will be their shadow a.k.a. passive investing. The market is a self-correcting system, where money flows towards the best values. Passive investing simply follows that flow of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If passive gets too influential, then the smart active managers will exploit the problem. Inefficiencies will balance themselves out in the long-term. And passive investing is a long-term technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it’s easy to avoid the pitfalls of index inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Index funds don’t have to exclude stocks. Many investment managers (like Fidelity and Vanguard) offer total market index funds. They include high and mighty S&amp;amp;P companies and all of the “company 501’s” out there that might be excluded from other index funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore–if there is an index inclusion bubble–the total market index funds own both sides of that bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total market fund would only be exposed to a bubble that includes entire asset classes. For example, one could claim that stocks in their entirety are overvalued, but that commodities are undervalued. Therefore, a total U.S. stock market index fund would still expose you the bad outcomes of bursting bubble!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this concerns you, then diversify your index investing via a lazy portfolio. There are indexes that track bond markets, international markets, different sized companies, commodities, REITs, etc. You can spread out your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green and Burry both make good points. Pal tells a nice story. I’m really glad I took some time to understand those ideas. Carlson and Felix support the ideas I’ve always heard: the wisdom of people like Jack Bogle and Burton Malkiel. What actions am I taking after all this conversation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading. Lots more reading. I want to learn more about Mike Green, Michael Burry, and their anti-passive compatriots. After all–they did compel me to type up 4000 words of arguments that go against my investing strategy. But I also want to remind myself of the reasons why I started indexing in the first place: Malkiel, Bogle, and people like Ben Carlson and Ben Felix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will be staying my course, at least for now. I have not been convinced to move away from indexing, or that there’s an index fund bubble. Indexes still float my boat, and I think the bubble argument has more bark than bite. I’m in it for the long run. I do not think hand-picking individual stocks is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Found this to be an excellent read and would love to hear what /investing has to say. Full article below: 

&amp;#x200B;

It is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of “value” investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (“book”) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as “eyeballs” or “engagement”. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up “the opportunity”.

Plenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America’s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals—stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.

This would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today’s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

The job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock’s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital—from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company’s worth. A different approach is required—not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.

## Graham’s cracker

To understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds—notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities—which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.

This new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published “Security Analysis” (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham’s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. “The Intelligent Investor”, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham’s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.

Underpinning it all is an important distinction—between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm’s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.

The approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm’s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a “more reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism”. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.

The enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham’s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world’s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett’s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University’s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.

It helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency—and a validation of the value approach.

All this has had a lasting impact. Most investors “almost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say”, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that “value” has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind “growth” stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.

In Graham’s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.

In service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles—assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google’s search algorithm or Microsoft’s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company’s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company’s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can’t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.

## A beancounter’s nightmare

There are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&amp;d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles’ treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&amp;d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.

The treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset—either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as “goodwill”. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.

The second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are “non-rival” goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.

In their book “Capitalism Without Capital” Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm’s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade—Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China—have grown to a size that was not widely predicted. But there are plenty of older asset-light businesses that were built on such network effects—think of Visa and Mastercard. The result is that industries become dominated by one or a few big players. The same goes for capital spending. A small number of leading firms now account for a large share of overall investment (see chart 3).

Physical assets usually have some second-hand value. Intangibles are different. Some are tradable: you can sell a well-known brand or license a patent. But many are not. You cannot (or cannot easily) sell a set of relationships with suppliers. That means the costs incurred in creating the asset are not recoverable—hence sunkenness. Business and product ideas can easily be copied by others, unless there is some legal means, such as a patent or copyright, to prevent it. This characteristic gives rise to spillovers from one company to another. And ideas often multiply in value when they are combined with other ideas. So intangibles tend to generate bigger synergies than tangible assets.

The third aspect of intangibles to consider is their implications for investors. A big one is that earnings and accounting book value have become less useful in gauging the value of a company. Profits are revenues minus costs. If a chunk of those costs are not running expenses but are instead spending on intangible assets that will generate future cashflows, then earnings are understated. And so, of course, is book value. The more a firm spends on advertising, r&amp;d, workforce training, software development and so on, the more distorted the picture is.

The distinction between a running expense and investment is crucial for securities analysis. An important part of the stock analyst’s job is to understand both the magnitude of investment and the returns on it. This is not a particularly novel argument, as Messrs Mauboussin and Callahan point out. It was made nearly 60 years ago in a seminal paper by Merton Miller and Francesco Modigliani, two Nobel-prize-winning economists. They divided the value of a company into two parts. The first—call it the “steady state”—assumes that that the company can sustain its current profits into the future. The second is the present value of future growth opportunities—essentially what the firm might become. The second part depends on the firm’s investment: how much it does, the returns on that investment and how long the opportunity lasts. To begin to estimate this you have to work out the true rate of investment and the true returns on that investment.

The nature of intangible assets makes this a tricky calculation. But worthwhile analysis is usually difficult. “You can’t abdicate your responsibility to understand the magnitude of investment and the returns to it,” says Mr Mauboussin. Old-style value investors emphasise the steady state but largely ignore the growth-opportunities part. But for a youngish company able to grow at an exponential rate by exploiting increasing returns to scale, the future opportunity will account for the bulk of valuation. For such a firm with a high return on investment, it makes sense to plough profits back into the firm—and indeed to borrow to finance further investment.

Picking winners in an intangible economy—and paying a price for stocks commensurate with their chances of success—is not for the faint-hearted. Some investments will be a washout; sunkenness means some costs cannot be recovered. Network effects give rise to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most markets, in which the second-best firm is worth a fraction of the best. Value investing seems safer. But the trouble with screening for stocks with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratio is that it is likelier to select businesses whose best times are behind them than it is to identify future success.

## Up, up and away

Properly understood, the idea of fundamental value has not changed. Graham’s key insight was that price will sometimes fall below intrinsic value (in which case, buy) and sometimes will rise above it (in which case, sell). In an economy mostly made up of tangible assets you could perhaps rely on a growth stock that had got ahead of itself to be pulled back to earth, and a value stock that got left behind to eventually catch up. Reversion to the mean was the order of the day. But in a world of increasing returns to scale, a firm that rises quickly will often keep on rising.

The economy has changed. The way investors think about valuation has to change, too. This is a case that’s harder to make when the valuation differential between tech and value stocks is so stark. A correction at some stage would not be a great surprise. The appeal of old-style value investing is that it is tethered to something concrete. In contrast, forward-looking valuations are by their nature more speculative. Bubbles are perhaps unavoidable; some people will extrapolate too far. Nevertheless, were Ben Graham alive today he would probably be revising his thinking. No one, least of all the father of value investing, said stockpicking was easy.",t2_175fc3,False,,0,False,"The Economist: ""Value investing is struggling to remain relevant""",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jt5zt8,False,dark,0.94,,public,194,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,194,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605252930.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/11/12/value-investing-is-struggling-to-remain-relevant""&gt;https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/11/12/value-investing-is-struggling-to-remain-relevant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found this to be an excellent read and would love to hear what /investing has to say. Full article below: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of “value” investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (“book”) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as “eyeballs” or “engagement”. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up “the opportunity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America’s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals—stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today’s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock’s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital—from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company’s worth. A different approach is required—not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Graham’s cracker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds—notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities—which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published “Security Analysis” (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham’s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. “The Intelligent Investor”, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham’s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning it all is an important distinction—between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm’s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm’s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a “more reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism”. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham’s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world’s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett’s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University’s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency—and a validation of the value approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this has had a lasting impact. Most investors “almost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say”, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that “value” has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind “growth” stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Graham’s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles—assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google’s search algorithm or Microsoft’s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company’s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company’s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can’t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A beancounter’s nightmare&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&amp;amp;d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles’ treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&amp;amp;d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset—either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as “goodwill”. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are “non-rival” goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their book “Capitalism Without Capital” Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm’s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade—Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China—have grown to a size that was not widely predicted.

Washington state, on the other hand, saw the biggest leap last week, with new claims rising by more than 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

This asset allocation is based on a combination of Ray Dalio's [All Weather Portfolio](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-library/the-all-weather-strategy/), Chris Cole's [Dragon Portfolio](https://taylorpearson.me/thedragon/), and my own market views and risk preferences. I tried to keep this as simple as possible and not give 50 tickers in each asset class, because it detracts from the passive objective. The other theme you'll see is that there is a place for mutual funds. They're not good for index investing, but they are great vehicles for when active management is needed or when you can't find the right ETF! First read up on the risk parity strategies if you're not familiar, or this post won't be worthwhile. I'm happy to answer questions on my rationale for the different weightings or security selection.

50% Stocks/Cash - includes a global mutual fund with at least 40% exposure to non-US equities, my favorite single-company stock (100 shares to sell covered calls), and two low-cost sector ETFs. Aside from rebalancing, the covered calls are one of the only ""active"" parts of this portfolio. Keep some of the 50% in cash to dollar-cost-average your buying. Park it in an ultra short term bond ETF like JPST which are usually better than savings accounts. Cash is also another deflation hedge. Dalio's version has at least 30% in stocks. 

25% Bonds - includes a long term treasury ETF (TLT), and a tax free muni bond mutual fund (VNJTX). TIP is an option as well if you want more inflation protection.

10% Commodities Basket - I like BCM, it's an ETN that tracks the bloomberg commodity index. Great inflation hedge and solid exposure to gold as well.  The mutual fund I'd recommend here is EIPCX. 

2.5% Long Volatility - I use VIXM, it's an ETF that buys VIX futures a few months out. I would buy VIX options myself, but I wanted this to be a little more passive. The leverage here allows for a lot less allocation than the 25% exposure in the Dragon Portfolio. If you want a mutual fund to follow Dragon strategy at the full 25%, I'd use AMFAX or similar.

12.5% Bitcoin - The biggest departure from the sample portfolios. I'm bullish on bitcoin as a digital form of gold (all the same benefits), plus I have some gold exposure in the commodity basket.

Park it in an ultra short term bond ETF like JPST which are usually better than savings accounts. Cash is also another deflation hedge. Dalio&amp;#39;s version has at least 30% in stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25% Bonds - includes a long term treasury ETF (TLT), and a tax free muni bond mutual fund (VNJTX). TIP is an option as well if you want more inflation protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10% Commodities Basket - I like BCM, it&amp;#39;s an ETN that tracks the bloomberg commodity index. Great inflation hedge and solid exposure to gold as well.  The mutual fund I&amp;#39;d recommend here is EIPCX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.5% Long Volatility - I use VIXM, it&amp;#39;s an ETF that buys VIX futures a few months out. I would buy VIX options myself, but I wanted this to be a little more passive. The leverage here allows for a lot less allocation than the 25% exposure in the Dragon Portfolio. If you want a mutual fund to follow Dragon strategy at the full 25%, I&amp;#39;d use AMFAX or similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.5% Bitcoin - The biggest departure from the sample portfolios. I&amp;#39;m bullish on bitcoin as a digital form of gold (all the same benefits), plus I have some gold exposure in the commodity basket. Happy to elaborate but I prefer the fixed supply and ease of storage, compared to gold.&lt;/p&gt;

What are people's thoughts on telehealth stocks like Amwell and Teladoc?

With a possible 6-week national lockdown early next year under Biden and this statement from Amwell's CEO, are they a bubble or are Telehealth tools and software here to stay for the foreseeable future?

From the CEO

&gt; Amwell reported it had about 62,000 providers at the end of the third quarter, up 930% from about 6,000 in the same period last year. It tallied up more than 1.4 million visits in the quarter, up 450% compared to about 255,000 the same period in 2019.

&gt; While visit numbers are lower than what Amwell saw in March and April, he said, they continue to be much higher than before COVID. While officials would not make projections on expected fourth-quarter visits based on COVID, that said the company continues to see increased demand.

* Some of the hottest private consumer tech companies are rushing to file their IPO prospectuses so they can go public before the end of the year.
* Airbnb, DoorDash, Roblox and Wish are all expected to make their filings public by early next week, said people familiar with the matter.
* It’s already been a big year for tech IPOs, most notably in September, which was the busiest year on record for the New York Stock Exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

The holiday season is shaping up to be a celebratory time for tech IPO investors.

Between early and mid-December, public investors will likely get their first crack at buying stock in food delivery provider DoorDash, e-retailer Wish and kids gaming company Roblox, according to people familiar with the matter. Airbnb is also expected to file its prospectus by early next week, putting the home-sharing company in position to hold its market debut after Thanksgiving, said two of the people.

Filings are expected by next week, though the timing could change based on market conditions, said the people, who asked not to be named because their plans are private.

All four companies confidentially filed paperwork with the SEC this year, setting the stage for eventual public offerings. DoorDash announced its submission in February, followed by Airbnb and Wish in August and Roblox in October. Because the virtual roadshow has become commonplace during Covid, companies only need a couple weeks to meet with investors before their debuts.

Representatives from each of the companies declined to comment for this story.

Despite an economic crisis, tech IPOs are red hot, reflecting a sector that has outperformed the market in the face of a global pandemic, which has killed over 240,000 Americans, while investors also navigated the uncertainty of a presidential election. Stocks rallied after Joe Biden’s electoral defeat of President Donald Trump, giving tech companies that were surveying the market further incentive to go out now, said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of pre-IPO marketplace Forge.

The sector’s strong performance has persuaded all four companies to push forward with going public now, before conditions change. About a dozen other global tech companies could raise at least $1 billion in an offering that are preparing for 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter.

“There’s a bunch of pent-up demand,” Rodriques said. “A lot of people were waiting to see how the market would react in a Biden victory.” Rodriques said he’s not aware of any of the four companies’ plans.

During the pandemic, software, e-commerce and gaming companies have been among the biggest beneficiaries of a surge in spending on goods and services that cater to people who are home all day due to office and schools closures. Investors have poured money into stocks like Zoom for videoconferencing, Cloudflare for website security and Etsy for online retail.

An earlier IPO spurt in September included a share sale from cloud database vendor Snowflake, which raised a record amount of money for a software company. That was during the New York Stock Exchange’s busiest month on record. Gaming company Unity went public the same week as Snowflake, while software makers Palantir and Asana held direct listings soon after, enabling existing shareholders to sell stock to public market investors.

In most of the tech deals this year, the gains have primarily been gobbled up by the few investors who were able to get in at the IPO price and benefit from the pop. Snowflake, for example, more than doubled out of the gate but is trading below its opening day close. Software developer Sumo Logic and insurance tech company Lemonade have also dropped from their initial pop.

Unity and Palantir are the exceptions, and neither went the traditional IPO route. Unity’s top executives controlled the pricing and allocation of the company’s offering and allowed employees to sell a portion of their shares right away rather than waiting for the lockup to expire. Palantir’s stock is up almost 60% since its direct listing, which didn’t produce a pop because no new shares were sold.

Among the companies set to go public into 2021, many are exploring Unity’s structure as well as other options like direct listings and special purpose acquisition companies, said people with knowledge of the pipeline.

**How Covid changed their business**

Airbnb is the best-known name of the group that’s preparing to hit the market now, though it also has had the rockiest year. Coming into 2020, Airbnb was prepping for a blockbuster IPO. But the pandemic put a halt to travel, forcing Airbnb to cut 1,900 jobs, or about 25% of its workforce, raise $2 billion in high-interest debt and slash its valuation by 16% to $26 billion.

That was in April and May. In recent months, Airbnb has been able to reignite growth as travelers hit the road to seek out vacation homes off the beaten path. According to Airbnb, hosts in rural areas of the U.S. earned over $200 million in June, an increase of more than 25% from the prior year. Still, Bloomberg reported in August that revenue in the period ended June 30, dropped at least 67% from a year earlier, to $335 million.

DoorDash, valued by private investors at $16 billion, has been one of the top winners from consumers sheltering in place. Many restaurants have turned to delivery as their main source of revenue, and DoorDash has expanded its lead in the market. According to data from analytics firm Second Measure, the company earned 49% of U.S. meal delivery sales in September, more than double Uber Eats, which captured 22% of the market.

The election was also a major boon for DoorDash, though not because of Biden’s victory. Voters in California, DoorDash’s home state, passed Proposition 22, which allows gig economy companies to continue classifying their drivers as contractors. For DoorDash and grocery delivery provider Instacart, a likely 2021 IPO candidate, the ballot-box victory cleared the path for their public offerings.

Roblox has been around for 14 years, but it has never had a year like 2020. The company’s gaming app features millions of titles created by and for kids. Users build their own avatars, which they can move between games, buying digital currency along the way for in-app purchases. They can also rent a private server to host a virtual birthday party or other celebration.

As of April, Roblox expected $1 billion in billings this year. According to research firm SensorTower, player spending topped $100 million a month for the first time in May. Reuters reported last month that the company expects to double its recent $4 billion valuation in its IPO.

Wish was valued at $11.2 billion last year and has continued gaining momentum through its online marketplace that offers its more than 70 million active users discounted goods in categories like home goods, apparel and electronics. The company, which competes with Amazon, has also faced complaints from Wish users who claim the site hosts shady merchants and poor quality products.

Forge’s Rodriques said that while there’s a tight window to try to go public this year, the outlook for 2021 is looking good. With prospects of a coronavirus vaccine on the horizon and election volatility mostly behind us, there will likely be plenty of opportunities for the many private tech companies valued in the billions of dollars to test the markets later, he said.

“I think we could see 2021 be an absolutely booming year on a number of fronts,” Rodriques said.",t2_1o7qhf71,False,,0,False,"DoorDash, Roblox, Wish and Airbnb all expected to go public before year’s end, sources say",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jt2t6p,False,dark,0.94,,public,77,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,77,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605242652.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/airbnb-doordash-wish-roblox-ipos-all-expected-before-year-end.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/airbnb-doordash-wish-roblox-ipos-all-expected-before-year-end.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The company, which competes with Amazon, has also faced complaints from Wish users who claim the site hosts shady merchants and poor quality products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forge’s Rodriques said that while there’s a tight window to try to go public this year, the outlook for 2021 is looking good. With prospects of a coronavirus vaccine on the horizon and election volatility mostly behind us, there will likely be plenty of opportunities for the many private tech companies valued in the billions of dollars to test the markets later, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we could see 2021 be an absolutely booming year on a number of fronts,” Rodriques said.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I won't pretend to know a lot about finance or economics, but I sold all my positions in June on the belief that there is a massive bubble in asset prices - which I feel must pop sooner rather than later. I'll give my thoughts here, and then hopefully some people can come back with some refutations and differences of opinion - as I'd like to get a better understanding of the counterarguments.

As far as I can understand it, the traditional method of dealing with recessions in the past was to decrease interest rates. This allows for cheaper borrowing by companies, who can then invest the money they borrow into the production of future growth. This should then increase the size of the economy overall, resulting in a net creation of wealth. The negative effect of low interest rates is that it makes capital allocation less efficient. This is because companies need to produce a smaller amount of growth from the borrowed money in order to pay it back - encouraging less efficient companies to take out loans. This has resulted in 'zombie companies', whose profits can barely cover the tiny amount of interest required to service their debt. If interest rates were to rise even a small amount, these companies would quickly be unable to service their debt obligations and would face defaulting and bankruptcy.

I believe the ideal approach is to lower interest rates when times are hard - to encourage borrowing, but then to gradually raise them as the economy improves, in order to improve the efficiency of capital allocation, and to provide a buffer for reducing interest rates in the future. However, this has not been the strategy used in the past, and central banks have struggled to raise interest rates to previous levels after each successive crash without causing disruption to the markets and economy.

In 2008, during the global financial crisis, the rates were already relatively low before the crisis began. This meant that lowering the rates to zero was not enough to provide the required liquidity to the market, so an alternative approach had to be undertaken. This is known as Quantitative Easing (QE), and - to my understanding - is the purchase of government and corporate bonds by the central bank. The purpose of QE is to inject liquidity into the market while locking up assets in a way that the created money does not flow into the economy and cause high inflation - as would be the case if money was simply printed.

Again, I believe that the goal with QE is to provide short-term liquidity to the economy when times are bad, which is gradually rolled back as the economy improves, resulting in the selling of these assets into the market. Again, to my knowledge, this has not been accomplished effectively since 2008, resulting in a climate of low interest rates, and high levels of risky corporate debt held by central banks.

Now, we get to the COVID crisis, whereby the economy shrinks rapidly in response to lockdowns, lack of travel etc. The market takes a deep nosedive off this news, as companies begin to draw on credit lines to carry them through the downturn - resulting in a loss of liquidity. Central banks respond to this by cutting rates to zero. As the interest rates were still extremely low before the crash, this did not provide the required liquidity - so a huge amount of quantitative easing was required - over double that which was introduced during the 2008 crisis.

The rates being so low encourages spending rather than saving. However, in the COVID economy, there is nothing to really spend money on - there is no point in investing in productivity or future growth as sales and revenue are expected to be lower, not higher. The supply of bonds is also low, due to the huge amount of quantitative easing. This means that there is no place left for this additional liquidity to go - other than the stock market, further inflating a huge asset bubble. This is caused by the influx of retail investors into the market, stock buybacks by corporations, and financial firms having no other place to invest their money for a decent return.

I believe there are several key risks for the near future.

1. The extremely high level of bad corporate debt and the high number of zombie corporations means that a tiny hike in interest rates would cause a huge downturn in the stock market and would mean many companies face bankruptcy.
2. Any reduction in the stimulus provided by central banks would cause a credit crunch as companies try to draw on huge amounts of cheap credit.
3. A reduction in QE would mean there are no buyers for junk corporate bonds, meaning that companies cannot refinance their debt and will face default and bankruptcy.

Does anyone see a way this can all return to more sensible levels without a huge bubble popping? And is there anywhere in my post where I'm way off the mark? As I say, I'm not an expert on this at all.

I&amp;#39;ll give my thoughts here, and then hopefully some people can come back with some refutations and differences of opinion - as I&amp;#39;d like to get a better understanding of the counterarguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can understand it, the traditional method of dealing with recessions in the past was to decrease interest rates. This allows for cheaper borrowing by companies, who can then invest the money they borrow into the production of future growth. This should then increase the size of the economy overall, resulting in a net creation of wealth. The negative effect of low interest rates is that it makes capital allocation less efficient. This is because companies need to produce a smaller amount of growth from the borrowed money in order to pay it back - encouraging less efficient companies to take out loans. This has resulted in &amp;#39;zombie companies&amp;#39;, whose profits can barely cover the tiny amount of interest required to service their debt. If interest rates were to rise even a small amount, these companies would quickly be unable to service their debt obligations and would face defaulting and bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the ideal approach is to lower interest rates when times are hard - to encourage borrowing, but then to gradually raise them as the economy improves, in order to improve the efficiency of capital allocation, and to provide a buffer for reducing interest rates in the future. However, this has not been the strategy used in the past, and central banks have struggled to raise interest rates to previous levels after each successive crash without causing disruption to the markets and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, during the global financial crisis, the rates were already relatively low before the crisis began. This meant that lowering the rates to zero was not enough to provide the required liquidity to the market, so an alternative approach had to be undertaken. This is known as Quantitative Easing (QE), and - to my understanding - is the purchase of government and corporate bonds by the central bank. The purpose of QE is to inject liquidity into the market while locking up assets in a way that the created money does not flow into the economy and cause high inflation - as would be the case if money was simply printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I believe that the goal with QE is to provide short-term liquidity to the economy when times are bad, which is gradually rolled back as the economy improves, resulting in the selling of these assets into the market. Again, to my knowledge, this has not been accomplished effectively since 2008, resulting in a climate of low interest rates, and high levels of risky corporate debt held by central banks.&lt;/p&gt;

The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&amp;P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&amp;P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&amp;P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders.

,investing,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**",t2_p8vmm,False,,1,False,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_cyee69,False,dark,0.95,,public,271,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,271,,False,,1567518369.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1567395088.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/""&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that&amp;#39;s been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tied to investing:&lt;/strong&gt; this should be pretty straightforward but I&amp;#39;m laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization&amp;#39;s potential biases, etc.  If it&amp;#39;s not in the first list it&amp;#39;s probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effort:&lt;/strong&gt; no shitposts.  If you&amp;#39;re not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it&amp;#39;s probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like &amp;quot;fuck my portfolio&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn&amp;#39;t going to fly here.  That means if you&amp;#39;re repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn&amp;#39;t tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your post should be something like &amp;quot;I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah&amp;quot;.  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civility:&lt;/strong&gt; so we already don&amp;#39;t allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn&amp;#39;t an appropriate subreddit for that.  We&amp;#39;re here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  &lt;a href=""/r/investing""&gt;/r/investing&lt;/a&gt; is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that the guidelines are made clear, here&amp;#39;s the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we&amp;#39;re automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we&amp;#39;re not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren&amp;#39;t already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Corporate vs Investment News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/crasymike""&gt;/u/crasymike&lt;/a&gt; did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they&amp;#39;re in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can&amp;#39;t incite relevant discussion in every topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you include no relevant investing information then don&amp;#39;t be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we can&amp;#39;t figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn&amp;#39;t include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn&amp;#39;t link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is &amp;quot;borderline&amp;quot; not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn&amp;#39;t investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi everyone,

I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb's S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. Thanks

On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb's most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.

Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:

&gt;*"" “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.""*

But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:

(\****Note:*** *In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)*

1. Airbnb is a resilient business

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.

For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.

2. Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb

If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:

&gt;*“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”*

Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.

Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.

No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.

3. Strong customer retention and brand loyalty

One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.

&gt;*“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”*

Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.

Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.

4. International expansion is a big opportunity

Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.

It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.

Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:

&gt;\*“\****Expand our global network.*** *We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”*

There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)

The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.

5. Regulation is a big concern

Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.

Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:

&gt;*“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”*

Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.

Investment Plan

*Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.*

To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:

1. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?
2. What year should conclusions be based on?
3. What is a fair valuation?
4. Does Airbnb have good upside potential?

Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.

2. What year should conclusions be based on?

The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.

3. What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?

This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.

In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.

Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).

Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.

With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.

What’s my plan?

My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;I work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it&amp;#39;s important for me to understand major technology trends and tech companies. I put this post together to share some key takeaways I had from looking at Airbnb&amp;#39;s S-1 filing. If you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. I&amp;#39;m thinking about writing like this more often if it&amp;#39;s something people get value from. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday November 16th, Airbnb filed to go public. While a target IPO price has not yet been set, Airbnb looks to be aiming to raise about $3 billion dollars at an analyst-estimated valuation of $30 billion. This is up from Airbnb&amp;#39;s most recent valuation of $18.1 billion in April of this year when it raised a total of $2 billion in debt to cope with the Covid-19 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb is a remarkable company. What started in 2007 as 2 friends renting out airbeds in their apartment to attendees of a conference has, 13 years later, grown into a company operating in 220 countries with over 4 million hosts who have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. In 2019, there were 327 million nights and experiences booked on Airbnb. Nobody could have predicted those numbers in 2007. Airbnb has defined a brand new travel category and become a standard part of our vocabulary, much like Zoom. As they state in their S-1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; “Airbnb” has become synonymous with one-of-a-kind travel on a global scale.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, while Airbnb is clearly a remarkable company, is it a good investment? That’s the question that this post aims to answer. Here are some key takeaways from an analysis of Airbnb’s recent S-1 filing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;In case you’re wondering, an S-1 is the document that a companies files with the SEC when they plan to go public)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airbnb is a resilient business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on Airbnb’s business. Gross booking value (GBV) in March was down 127%. Due to cancellations and alterations, Airbnb actually lost money on bookings in March. However by August, GBV was only down 14% when compared to August 2019. This impressive recovery shows how strong Airbnb’s business is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the 9 months ending September 2020, Airbnb posted a revenue drop of 32% when compared with the first 9 months of 2019. While this is a concern, the cut to sales and marketing expenditure at the same time points to a business that is quite resilient - In the same time period that revenue dropped by 32%, Airbnb cut its sales and marketing spend by a massive 54%. The ability to cut sales and marketing spend by over half while only having a revenue drop of 32% (in the middle of a pandemic) points to a business that is highly resilient with strong brand and customer loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-Covid travel patterns may benefit Airbnb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare the gross nights and experiences booked on Airbnb to Airbnb’s gross booking value (GBV), we see an interesting pattern. Gross bookings in August are down 28% YoY while GBV is only down 14%. This means that the average spend on an individual booking has actually trended up this year! To further validate this point, long-term stays were down only 13% this year, compared to 81% for short-term stays. There was actually YoY growth for long-term stays from May to September. The importance of long-term stays is highlighted by the quote below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We believe the long-term stays category represents a different use case than leisure travel, and as a result, was not as impacted as dramatically by COVID-19.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term stays are a distinct competitive advantage for Airbnb and if trends continue they could drive a lot of long-term growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb has also highlighted a number of other categories that have performed particularly well this year. In particular, ‘domestic travel’, ‘short-distance travel’ and ‘travel outside top 20 cities’ have performed very well. For example, short-distance travel grew a whopping 38% YoY in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt these trends will reverse somewhat as we exit the pandemic. However, it is unlikely they will reverse fully. If these trends maintain decent momentum, they represent a shift in travel patterns that uniquely benefits Airbnb and provides a significant competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong customer retention and brand loyalty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking figures from the S-1 is that 91% of Airbnb’s traffic is organic, coming from direct and unpaid channels. This is very impressive. Airbnb has built an incredible brand and clearly has strong brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more guests via direct or unpaid channels and to decrease our performance marketing spend relative to 2019.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer engagement and retention are also impressively high on the platform. In 2019, 68% of guests left a review of their stay. 69% of revenue generate in 2019 was from repeat guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb also has very strong retention among their host community. In 2019, 84% of revenue came from people who had hosted in 2018. This shows that the majority of hosts are staying on the platform and continuing to earn money through Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International expansion is a big opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb’s revenue growth has slowed over the last three years. It grew by 32% in 2019, down from 43% in 2018. While slowed growth is never great, 32% is quite healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen what the impacts of Covid-19 will be on growth over the next few years. However, there seem to be big opportunities for international expansion which would allow Airbnb to maintain (and possibly improve) its growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb believes that its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. While you can always take these predictions with a grain of salt, it is clear that Airbnb believes that a big part of this market opportunity lies outside the US and Europe. They highlight international expansion as a key part of their long-term growth strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*“*&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expand our global network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;We plan to expand our global network in the countries in which we already have a deep presence, as well as to expand into markets where our penetration is lower, such as India, China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and tens of thousands of smaller markets and remote areas around the world.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some encouraging signs that Airbnb has the potential to grow their international markets. They operate in 220 countries and importantly, 86% of their hosts are outside the US. International markets have also seen an increase in GBV and average nights per booking. In fact, Latin America has the highest average nights per booking of any region, at 4.1 nights. (North America is 3.7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong customer loyalty previously mentioned, significant host presence in international markets (86%) and changing consumption patterns towards longer stays means that Airbnb has the potential to unlock a lot of value as they focus on international markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation is a big concern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulation is a big risk for Airbnb. 70% of the company’s top 200 largest cities (by revenue) have implemented some form of regulation on short-term stays. For example, London has put a 90 nights per year limit on short term stays for properties without specific planning permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb make it clear in the S-1 that the evolving regulatory situation is a cause for concern:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We are subject to a wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous laws and regulations that may adversely impact our operations and discourage hosts and guests from using our platform, and that could cause us to incur significant liabilities including fines and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airbnb makes sure to point out that they are not dependant on any one city, region or country. For example, the US is the only country that represents over 10% of Airbnb’s revenue. While this may be true, the evolving regulatory environment does not seem to be going in Airbnb’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment Plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note that this is just an explanation of investing decisions for my personal portfolio and not a recommendation to anyone to buy/sell any stock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a decision on whether or not to invest in Airbnb, I believe there are 3 important questions to answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does Airbnb have good upside potential?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What year should conclusions be based on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a fair valuation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does Airbnb have good upside potential?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are regulatory concerns, based on the above analysis I believe that Airbnb has strong upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What year should conclusions be based on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Airbnb S-1 is primarily focused on 2019 numbers. Airbnb believes that 2019 figures are the fairest reflection of the strength of the business. They believe that 2020 is a highly irregular year and that the company will rebound quickly post-covid. Investors should come up with their own conclusion on that but I agree with Airbnb that 2019 is a fair reflection of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a fair valuation for Airbnb?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get tricky. In some ways, Airbnb doesn’t have any direct competitors to compare against. They are similar to both OTAs (online travel agents) and hotel chains like Hilton but obviously quite different in a number of ways too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, an interesting comparison is with Uber. While not exactly the same, Airbnb and Uber have a lot of similarities. They are both semi-marketplaces (Airbnb is closer to a true marketplace). Uber connects drivers with riders while Airbnb connects hosts with guests. They have a similar business model in that they both take a % of each transaction on their platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there are quite a few differences. In particular, Uber drivers are far more commoditised than Airbnb hosts. Uber also has more direct competition (Lyft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at 2019 figures for the fairest comparison, Uber is currently priced at roughly 6.33 times 2019 revenue. If we go with the analyst expected valuation of $30 billion, Airbnb would be valued at roughly 6 times 2019 revenue. Uber grew revenue 26% YoY in 2019 while Airbnb grew 32%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind and particularly considering that Uber’s model is less defensible, I believe that the analyst-estimated $30 billion valuation represents a very good price for Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s my plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan is to wait and see what happens on IPO day. If analysts are wrong and the stock pops above $40/50 billion, I won’t be purchasing and will wait to see what Airbnb’s performance is like over the next few months. If the stock settles at or below $30 billion, then I will definitely be adding it to my portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"One  of  Japan's  biggest stock investors just reported record gains of more than  $50 billion  after a well-timed bet. But the person who engineered the windfall won't be getting a  Wall Street -style bonus this holiday season, and some have even started saying he shouldn't play the market so much.

That's because the hot-hitting portfolio manager is Gov.  Haruhiko Kuroda , head of  Japan's  central bank. Mr. Kuroda has led the  Bank of Japan's  push, unusual among global central banks, to invest in the  Tokyo  stock market as a way of rousing the nation's animal spirits.

In March, he doubled the BOJ's annual ceiling for its purchases of exchange-traded funds to the equivalent of  $115 billion . That was the month the stock market began surging after a pandemic-induced dip. It closed Thursday at a 29-year high, up 60% from this year's low.

The superb timing helped the central bank report a record jump for a six- month period in its stock portfolio's gains when it released its semiannual financial report Thursday. It said the market value of its holdings stood at the equivalent of nearly  $400 billion  as of  Sept. 30 , which represented an unrealized profit of  $56 billion  over what it paid.

Six months earlier, the BOJ had barely any unrealized profit left, and at one point in March Mr. Kuroda said it was carrying large losses.

The stock-buying program, which began under Mr. Kuroda's predecessor a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, isn't aimed at making trading profits. It is supposed to encourage broader risk-taking in the economy and ensure that prices are rising at a small and steady clip.

Recently, with inflation stuck around zero, some analysts are questioning whether the program is doing much good--especially during a pandemic, when other factors are weighing on the psychology of consumers and businesses.

Also, the central bank now owns more than 6% of the total value of the  Tokyo  stock market, leading some to wonder whether the premier symbol of capitalism could be undermined by state influence.

 NLI Research Institute  strategist  Shingo Ide  said the central bank's outsize role could hurt corporate governance because it can't act like other shareholders in monitoring company strategy and CEO performance.

""Because such a large unrealized profit means the bank's holdings are also getting bigger and bigger, there will likely be more demand from outside the BOJ to sell the stocks or start thinking about an exit policy,"" said Naomi Muguruma, an economist at  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities .

Ms. Muguruma said the BOJ would feel more comfortable starting such a discussion while it is sitting on profits.

The central bank doesn't directly buy individual stocks but invests in a swath of the market through exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. It bought  $15 billion  in ETFs in March alone, but the pace has slowed significantly in recent months as the market recovers.

Mr. Kuroda said last week that he wasn't thinking of any quick changes in the program, with the stock market one of the bright signs for an economy that is only halfway back from its pandemic bottom.

""We need to prevent any market instability from causing a worsening of business and household confidence,"" Mr. Kuroda told a parliamentary committee. "" The BOJ's ETF purchases were effective in easing instability caused by the impact of coronavirus infections.""

Still, there are signs that a rethink is in its early stages.  One  of the bank's nine policy board members, Takako Masai, said last week that the bank might have to consider tweaking its purchases and alluded to the uncomfortably large size of its holdings.

""It is necessary to have discussions pre-emptively to improve flexibility and nurture the market,"" said Ms. Masai, who used to work at a commercial bank.

A former  Bank of Japan  executive director,  Shigeki Kushida , said in a recent column in a publication for financial analysts that the BOJ could offer to sell its stocks to individual investors through financial firms rather than dumping the ETFs on the open market.

He said that method could avoid market confusion and encourage households to shift their savings into riskier assets from safe but zero-return bank accounts.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,Japan's Stock-Playing Central Bank Racks Up $56 Billion Gain,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k1qzx8,False,dark,0.91,,public,54,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,54,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606466383.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One  of  Japan&amp;#39;s  biggest stock investors just reported record gains of more than  $50 billion  after a well-timed bet. But the person who engineered the windfall won&amp;#39;t be getting a  Wall Street -style bonus this holiday season, and some have even started saying he shouldn&amp;#39;t play the market so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s because the hot-hitting portfolio manager is Gov.  Haruhiko Kuroda , head of  Japan&amp;#39;s  central bank. Mr. Kuroda has led the  Bank of Japan&amp;#39;s  push, unusual among global central banks, to invest in the  Tokyo  stock market as a way of rousing the nation&amp;#39;s animal spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, he doubled the BOJ&amp;#39;s annual ceiling for its purchases of exchange-traded funds to the equivalent of  $115 billion . That was the month the stock market began surging after a pandemic-induced dip. It closed Thursday at a 29-year high, up 60% from this year&amp;#39;s low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The superb timing helped the central bank report a record jump for a six- month period in its stock portfolio&amp;#39;s gains when it released its semiannual financial report Thursday. It said the market value of its holdings stood at the equivalent of nearly  $400 billion  as of  Sept. 30 , which represented an unrealized profit of  $56 billion  over what it paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months earlier, the BOJ had barely any unrealized profit left, and at one point in March Mr. Kuroda said it was carrying large losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stock-buying program, which began under Mr. Kuroda&amp;#39;s predecessor a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, isn&amp;#39;t aimed at making trading profits. It is supposed to encourage broader risk-taking in the economy and ensure that prices are rising at a small and steady clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, with inflation stuck around zero, some analysts are questioning whether the program is doing much good--especially during a pandemic, when other factors are weighing on the psychology of consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the central bank now owns more than 6% of the total value of the  Tokyo  stock market, leading some to wonder whether the premier symbol of capitalism could be undermined by state influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NLI Research Institute  strategist  Shingo Ide  said the central bank&amp;#39;s outsize role could hurt corporate governance because it can&amp;#39;t act like other shareholders in monitoring company strategy and CEO performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Because such a large unrealized profit means the bank&amp;#39;s holdings are also getting bigger and bigger, there will likely be more demand from outside the BOJ to sell the stocks or start thinking about an exit policy,&amp;quot; said Naomi Muguruma, an economist at  Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Muguruma said the BOJ would feel more comfortable starting such a discussion while it is sitting on profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank doesn&amp;#39;t directly buy individual stocks but invests in a swath of the market through exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. It bought  $15 billion  in ETFs in March alone, but the pace has slowed significantly in recent months as the market recovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kuroda said last week that he wasn&amp;#39;t thinking of any quick changes in the program, with the stock market one of the bright signs for an economy that is only halfway back from its pandemic bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We need to prevent any market instability from causing a worsening of business and household confidence,&amp;quot; Mr. Kuroda told a parliamentary committee. &amp;quot; The BOJ&amp;#39;s ETF purchases were effective in easing instability caused by the impact of coronavirus infections.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are signs that a rethink is in its early stages.  One  of the bank&amp;#39;s nine policy board members, Takako Masai, said last week that the bank might have to consider tweaking its purchases and alluded to the uncomfortably large size of its holdings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is necessary to have discussions pre-emptively to improve flexibility and nurture the market,&amp;quot; said Ms. Masai, who used to work at a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi All,

I am an absolute noob when it comes to stocks and numbers, but with the market just going up and up, it seems like anyone can make a buck nowadays.

With the intention to make it a fairer market. The argument being that these algos have a substantial advantage over manual investments by humans, therefore making it an unfair market place.

Sorry for the word wall, just skip it if you want and give me your 2c on the title question.

For those who aren't aware, pretty much all the large investment firms will have a subsidiary of these ""ai"" investors, I say that in quotation, as they are just very complicated programs, that among many other features, can monitor and ""learn"" the current market sentiment and have a constant monitor on all news outlets, relevant social media accounts etc etc.

These aren't your basic level apps that can be used by the general public(again showing an unlevel playing field), basically over the last few decades the financial industry has employed a HUGE amount of top level programmers, engineers, mathematicians etc in a race to create an automated trading system that is better than humans.

If this interests you, I strongly suggest you do some research about ""trading algos"" 

These algos can make 100+ trades within a minute. They are monitoring the market 24/7/365. 
They can research and calculate an investment within seconds, something that would take a person hours.

And besides all this, there is the view that this is unethical trading. The stock market was not intended for an 'investor' to buy and sell a stock 20 times in a day. There is something inherently wrong with this new trading trend being brought in by the big boys. It's not like they were disadvantaged before. I'm sure many of you can agree, the markets are behaving increasingly irrationally recently.
I cant help but think, that once these algos go full on, they are going to be the winners of the market, it's what they are designed to do! And for every win, there is a lose(that's us btw) There's no way the regular investors can compete with them.

Obviously, this would be a very difficult/impossible proposal to push through. 

But who knows, get a few bad ass lawyers who are sick of these assholes shitting on the system. Get some convincing argument about this tech creating unfair playing field, essentially market monopoly(would need ROI for these systems, vs average investors ROI) 

As an end note. We are literally enroute to  putting the world economy in the hands of algorithms, programmed to make profit. They just want numbers to increase in their account. Much like a trader yes. But humans are sentient beings, we don't glitch, we might fat finger every now and then. But we don't glitch, we have reasoning, and biasis, and theory's and stubbornness. It's what makes the market a place for us, to go balls deep, make considered investments, yolo your savings or whatever floats your boat.

Salesforce is in advanced talks to acquire  Slack Technologies Inc. ,  The Wall Street Journal  reported Wednesday, in what would be Mr. Benioff's biggest acquisition to date and the company's most direct attack on a market  Microsoft  has identified as critical to its growth.

The deal, which could still fall through, would add fuel to Salesforce's ambition to become the go-to software platform for business customers to use for everything from data analysis to managing customer relationships to even daily communication.

The pandemic has amplified Salesforce's efforts. When Covid-19 broke out, Mr. Benioff quickly launched [w](https://Work.com)ork.com -- a suite of applications companies could use for contract tracing, mental-health checks and shift scheduling.

A deal for Slack could heat up the simmering rivalry between Salesforce and  Microsoft . About five years ago  Microsoft  was in talks to buy Salesforce, but the deal fell apart over price. Salesforce lost out to  Microsoft  in 2016 in bidding for  LinkedIn Corp. , the business-focused social-media network. The loss stung. Salesforce responded by urging regulators to examine  Microsoft's  proposed purchase on antitrust grounds; the deal passed regulatory scrutiny.

Landing Slack, which  Microsoft  once tried to acquire, could amount to a bit of revenge for Mr. Benioff.

Having failed to capture Slack,  Microsoft  launched its own workplace collaboration tool, called Teams, spurring a sometimes heated battle between the two companies.

""They want to kill us,"" Slack CEO  Stewart Butterfield  told the Journal earlier this year. This summer, Slack filed a complaint with the  European Union  over alleged antitrust behavior by  Microsoft  in using its dominance to push Teams.

Slack ""extends the footprint of what Salesforce goes after,"" said Jefferies analyst  Brent Thill . ""Not everyone uses a sales system, but everyone can use collaboration. The beauty of Slack and Teams is that it touches everything inside enterprises.""

Mr. Benioff has a history of deal making since he co-founded Salesforce 21 years ago and turned it into one of the most successful companies in the then still nascent market of providing software as a service. Salesforce completed its biggest-ever purchase last year, paying around  $15 billion  in stock for data-analytics platform  Tableau Software Inc. 

A year earlier it splashed out more than  $5 billion  for cloud-application provider MuleSoft. Inc. This year Salesforce said it was buying cloud-software provider  Vlocity Inc. 

Mr. Benioff has long been one of  Silicon Valley's  highest-profile and most outspoken executives, using venues like the  World Economic Forum  in  Davos, Switzerland , to champion causes. He set up Salesforce with a pledge of corporate giving and bought himself an even larger platform with his acquisition of  Time Magazine  two years ago.

The  San Francisco -based company also has made a big push into the emerging field of artificial intelligence, developing tools to help customers make better use of their data. In 2016, it acquired PredictionIO, which makes software for building machine-learning apps. That followed the purchase of MinHash and Tempo AI, two further machine-learning companies. In 2014, it bought RelateIQ, which also specializes in the field.

Breaking into the market of workplace collaboration has long been on Salesforce's agenda. In 2010, it launched Chatter, a private social network for companies to collaborate. And in 2016, it bought cloud-document collaboration app company  Quip Inc.  for more than  $500 million . Neither product attracted a wide following. Acquiring Slack, which Salesforce had previously explored buying, would immediately make the company a big player in the workplace- collaboration market. Slack has more than 130,000 paying customers.

Salesforce, which declined to comment for this article, is pursuing Slack as competition in its core business of customer relationship management software is intensifying.  Adobe Inc.  this month said it would buy Workfront, a platform for marketers, for  $1.5 billion .  Microsoft  also has been pushing its rival product, called Dynamics. Salesforce still has the largest share with 20.1% of the world-wide market in 2019 compared with 2.6% for Microsoft Dynamics, according to research firm  Gartner Inc. 

Even with Slack, Salesforce would be a comparatively small rival to  Microsoft . The  Redmond, Wash. , company had sales of  $143 billion  in its latest financial year, generated by business enterprise software, its cloud-computing infrastructure, and consumer-facing businesses, such as videogaming, which has exploded during the pandemic. Its sales are roughly nine times Salesforce's annual revenue.  Microsoft's  market valuation tops  $1.6 trillion , about six times that of Slack and Salesforce combined.

Last year Salesforce said it was seeking to reach  $28 billion  in annual sales in the 2023 financial year. It had  $16 billion  in sales in its most recent financial year.

""He really needs to keep growing,"" said  Mark Moerdler , senior research analyst at  Bernstein Research , of Mr. Benioff. ""He needs another big acquisition. Slack gives him a big acquisition. It gives him revenue.""

Slack also has been looking to broaden its appeal. Companies have used Slack principally for intra-office communications. In June, the software provider introduced Slack Connect, which allows messages to be sent between different companies. Slack's Mr. Butterfield said the feature has driven a rise in paying customers and should fuel future growth.

But big acquisition plans aren't without pitfalls. When Salesforce tried to buy social-media company  Twitter Inc.  in 2016, Mr. Benioff faced significant pushback from investors and he walked away from the deal. Although Slack is more in the mainstream of Salesforce's business than Twitter, it would still come at a hefty price given Slack's  $17 billion  market value before Wednesday's stock surge.

""Investors don't want Salesforce to do a big deal,"" Mr. Thill of Jefferies said, adding they want the company to show it can generate growth from within.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,"With Slack, Salesforce Would Put Heat on Microsoft",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k1ltlp,False,dark,0.73,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606448234.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce Inc.  has thrived for years as a niche business-software vendor with a chief executive,  Marc Benioff , who has positioned himself as a prominent voice in American business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Mr. Benioff is taking steps that analysts say aim higher, intensifying the company&amp;#39;s battle with the industry&amp;#39;s biggest player:  Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

“So what is Microvast?

TLDR: EV Battery Maker based in Texas, business focuses in Asia (China market is $$). One of the best EV battery techs right now. Already has 100M revenue this year.

It makes EV batteries based on Lithium Titanium Oxide (LTO) chemistry. Microvast's batteries have longer life, shorter charging times, and offer substantial lower cost of ownership by eliminating swapping station infrastructures required by buses running on LFP batteries.

Their batteries powered the electric buses used in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, it expects to generate more than $100 million in revenue this financial year. Most other EV companies don't even have revenue yet.

If you missed out on CIIC train, this will be the next hype play. I don't expect it to have big jumps in the next few days, but the merger agreement with Microvast should come out within the next 2 weeks. Get in early before it comes out and jumps up 50%. Shares and warrants are both cheap right now. Once merger is announced, THCB will easily go to ~$20 range.

Reminder: Gonna take a couple weeks before it moons (from merger agreement confirmation), BE PATIENT”

Since this is a SPAC, the price floor is $10.22 if the merger doesn’t go through. This means your downside is limited.

REE is rare earth elements,  I won't go into the details but basically think of permanent magnets.   They are used in  fighter jets,  MRI,  Cellphones etc.    Most importantly they are in EVs and wind turbines which is the hottest sectors right now other than weed.  

I won't go into too much details because you but as of now the whole market is completely dominated by China and that's why Trump signed an executive order to bring REE supply chain back to domestic at all cost.   This will continue regardless of Biden or Trump because it is crucial for the development of the important industries as well as defense.  China has threatened to cut US off from these precious metals and has done so with Japan for disputes in 2010. 

As of now everything, I mean 100%, is sent back to China and it is refined and turned into alloys and oxides then sent back.   If America want to make EV and turbines domestically the demand is huge.   This is a EV long term play so get in early. 


Why MP?  There are so many REE companies out there? 

- MONOPOLY domestic play. Actually have a functional mine from bankruptcy before.  Now it is under new management and is actually functional unlike other companies.   If you know anything about mining you would know to get a mine functional would take 5 to 10 years not even counting infrastructure.    The REE price is so low to compete we won't be seeing any real competition soon because it is not cost effective to develop a mine. Most REE companies are just a dream where they suddenly wake up and get grants from DOD and everything just magically happens into a 10 bagger overnight.  Only other real non Chinese competitor is Lynas but they are ally Aussie owned. 

- MP is one of the world's biggest mine in the world

- 1 of 3 companies to receive grants from Pentagon.  9. 6 million for seperation capabilities enhancement

- Phase 2 of 170million to upgrade to produce oxides and magnets

- Investors include Chamath, omega advisors &amp; Slate path capital

- Third quarter revenue grew 52%; net income yoy increased 4x to 14. 6 million ,  adjusted EBITDA grew 159% yoy to 11. 6 million

- LOTS of factors such as EV, defense, China, and solar play all incorporated into one!!  Does it get batter than this?

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced a new proposal on Tuesday, which could allow companies like Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER) and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ: LYFT), and DoorDash to compensate gig economy workers in equity.

What Happened: The regulator has proposed a pilot program for tech aggregators that hire gig economy workers or drivers, under which the companies can pay up to 15% of the worker compensation (not exceeding $75,000 in three years) in stock rather than cash.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton clarified the rationale behind the proposal by saying work relationships have evolved along with technology, and gig economy workers are a vital cog in the broader U.S. economy's growth.

The proposal will be open to a 60-day public comment period and may come into force only under the new leadership chosen by President-elect Joe Biden.

Why It Matters: California attorney general had sued both Uber and Lyft earlier this year for not following the California Assembly Bill 5, which forced aggregators to reclassify workers as employees, making them entitled to similar benefits. However, the ride-hailing companies won the Proposition 22 referendum that exempts it from reclassifying gig workers. 

In a bid to garner support for the referendum, the companies had guaranteed other benefits such as health insurance for drivers who work 15 hours or more a week, occupational-accident insurance coverage, and 30 cents for every mile driven, among other protections.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,"Uber, Lyft, Doordash Can Pay Gig Workers Up To 15% Compensation in Stock Under New SEC proposal",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k0qn1k,False,dark,0.97,,public,1142,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1142,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1606333020.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"The question isn't \*when\* you should get out, its **why** you should get out.

Remember, the goal isn't 1 10x gain (though that's pretty amazing, right?!). The number of companies that see a 10x gain are &lt; 1%. However, if you get out at say a 80% gain, you're looking at a significantly larger chance of that happening. If you're looking at a 20% gain then, many companies can give you that return.

**Understand what your end goal is and break it down on how you can get there. Run toward that dream instead of running away from whatever it is that you think money will help you escape from.**

So what's all this mean? Figure out where you're trying to get to. Want to turn 10,000 into 1,000,000?

You could hope for 1 stock that you're fully invested in generating a 100x (1000% return). Chances of that happening... minimal. Chances of that 10,000 turning into 15,000 (50%) return much better. Look, making 1,000,000 out of 10,000 is NOT easy. It's luck, timing, and to an extent skill and discipline.

If you want to make a million bucks out of a single win on a 10,000 investment, you need to find something that's going to generate a 10,000% return. Good freaking luck. But... do you think you could find opportunities that can generate a 20% return? Probably so. Yes, you'll need to do this 500 times, but if you don't think you have the time and discipline to to find 500 opportunities in 700 days (2 trading years)... I mean... take a step back and breathe... Of course 10,000% is possible - you'll see that in WSB all the time. But what you won't see are the other two types of people:

1. People who made that 10,000% return over several years. Guarantee you this group is larger than that # of people who generated a single 10,000% return on 1 investment.
2. People who lost it all chasing that 10,000% return who have no interest in sharing their pain for BS karma points.  Guarantee you that this group is significantly larger than group 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**To put this all in perspective: Do you think you'd have an easier time of generating:**

\- 1 10,000% return or

\- 500 20% returns.

Put another way, do you think you could generate 1 20% return each day for the next couple years? It's not easy at all. But then again, if that's not very easy, then exactly how easy is generating 1, 10,000% return. And what happens if you lose your 10,000 on 1 investment that went south (cough...SPX weekly puts / calls)

**BEGINNING INVESTMENT:** $10,000

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** $1,000,000

|\# of positive investment outcomes|% return required|Chances of this happening|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|10,000%|Really freaking low|
|10|1,000%|Really, really low|
|20|500%|still really low|

|100|100%|MSFT hands these out in the long run|
|200|50%|doable|
|500|20%|Really, really doable|

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: A note about compounding.** 

If you consistently re-invested your gains, you'd only need 25 successful outcomes. This is doable, but it's incredibly risky as you're assuming (much like I did above) that every investment leads to a 20% gain. If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding *looks* like.

**EDIT: A note about reality**

You're not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I'm not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you'll know **why** you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn't yet returned what it's capable of returning)

If you were to put all your eggs into one basket then this is what compounding &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: A note about reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not going to consistently make 20% gains each investment. Some will be -5%, -25%, - 100% and others will be 5%, 20%, 100%, 400%. There are entire books, companies, funds etc...dedicated to figuring out how / when / who to invest in. I&amp;#39;m not going there. My point is not what you should invest in, but a reality check that turning 10,000 into a million is absolutely doable. If you go in knowing what it takes to get there, then you&amp;#39;ll know &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; you need to sell a position (hint: so you can go on an re-invest that sum into another investment that is undervalued and hasn&amp;#39;t yet returned what it&amp;#39;s capable of returning)&lt;/p&gt;

In the book, it is mentioned that some numbers are essential in determining the company's past performance and the current quality. However, I have found that some of the ratios are difficult, if not impossible to interpret due to the negative output.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in many start-ups the operating cash flow and free cashflow can be negative. In this way, how to interpret the following ratios?

&amp;#x200B;

* Growth in Operating Income per Fully Diluted Share

&amp;#x200B;

§ ΔOI/FDS = 

&amp;#x200B;

\[(operating income / fully diluted shares)second\_year

\-(operating income / fully diluted shares)first\_year\] 

&amp;#x200B;

/ (operating income / fully diluted shares)first\_year

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Growth in Free Cash Flow per Fully Diluted Share

&amp;#x200B;

§ ΔFCF/FDS =\[(levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)second\_year

\-(levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)first\_year\]

&amp;#x200B;

 / (levered free cash flow / fully diluted shares)first\_year

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This cases can be as follows:

	1) The denominator is -ve, resulting in an -ve output

	2) The numerator is -ve, resulting in an -ve output

	3) Both the denominator and numerator are -ve, resulting in an +ve output

,investing,"In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?

After more discussions,  Doug Marland , a 23-year-old comedian from  New Jersey , raised his hand to join a lawsuit objecting to the Trump administration's order to ban the app. Two others -- musician  Alec Chambers  and fashion designer Cosette Rinab -- also volunteered.

The three have a combined 7.4 million followers on TikTok and make their livings off the app. The suit argued that a ban would mean losing their income and limiting their ability to express themselves.

The lawsuit got little attention when it was filed in a  Pennsylvania  court. The TikTok stars ultimately prevailed -- and the case has become central in creating a path for the app to maintain its foothold in the U.S., where it is now used by almost one in three Americans.

It looked like a grass-roots effort, but it was not. Behind the scenes, the legal action was orchestrated by TikTok and its Chinese parent company,  ByteDance Ltd. , according to people familiar with the matter. It lined up the influencers to be plaintiffs, connected them with a top First Amendment lawyer and helped create a legal strategy that was complementary to a separate lawsuit the company pursued under its own name, the people said.

It was an unexpected twist in a geopolitical business saga that began this summer, and continues with a preliminary deal still under negotiation that involves  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  taking stakes in TikTok.

ByteDance and its potential U.S. partners are optimistic about completing a deal in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with their discussions and internal thinking. On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted ByteDance a one-week extension to complete a deal, putting the new deadline at  Dec. 4 .

In August, President Trump signed an order calling for TikTok to be shut down or, alternatively, sold to a U.S. company. The administration said it feared ByteDance could share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, which the company said it would never do.

The first ruling in TikTok's favor came with its own lawsuit, which argued that an initial  Commerce Department  ban on downloading or updating the app would harm the company's business. On  Sept. 27 , Judge  Carl Nichols  in the  U.S. District Court  in  Washington, D.C. , determined that the government likely overstepped its authority under national-security law. The government appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.

On  Oct. 30 , Judge  Wendy Beetlestone , in federal court for the  Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania , ruled on the influencer lawsuit. She blocked  Commerce Department  restrictions that would have barred U.S. companies from listing TikTok in their app stores -- a move that would effectively make it inoperable in the U.S.

""Without access to the TikTok app, Plaintiffs would lose access to all of these followers, as well as to the professional opportunities afforded by TikTok,"" Judge Beetlestone said in her decision.

The U.S. government has appealed the ruling. The government called the plaintiffs' claims meritless and argued their request to block the ban would "" necessarily infringe on the President's authority to block business-to-business economic transactions with a foreign entity in the midst of a declared national- security emergency.""

In a statement, TikTok's interim head,  Vanessa Pappas  said: ""We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to providing a home for them to do so.""

 One  of ByteDance's goals in recent months was to draw out the Trump administration's assault, the people said, betting that key officials would likely become increasingly distracted as the election approached.

The TikTok review by the administration began with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which evaluates deals for national security risks. That committee has ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations of TikTok, out of concern that user data could be shared with the Chinese government given regulations there that require companies to hand over huge swaths of information. ByteDance has said it would never share data with the Chinese government, though analysts and experts say companies generally have little choice but to comply if asked.

ByteDance's legal efforts were designed to chip away at the more punitive efforts by the Trump administration, even while it pursued a deal that would satisfy the Cfius order, which also has bipartisan support in  Washington . Any deal will ultimately require signoff from the U.S. president.

Although President-elect Biden has not made clear his position on TikTok, the committee's divestiture order would still likely stand under new administration.

For now, an outright ban of TikTok appears off the table: On  Nov. 12 , the  Commerce Department  said it wouldn't enforce the order that would have effectively forced TikTok to shut down, citing the ruling in the stars' lawsuit, and the administration's legal options are dwindling.

""It's a big muddle because of these lawsuits,"" said a senior administration official.

Ms. Rinab, a 21-year-old senior at the  University of Southern California , said she started crying when she learned of the court victory. ""I was so, so happy,"" she said.

""This entire experience has been one I'll never forget,"" said Mr. Marland. ""It taught me a lot about the country, the way laws work, and court procedures.""

While TikTok was aggressively pushing back on the proposed bans in the courts, it also pledged to work cooperatively with national-security regulators on the potential deal that would address the U.S. government's data-security concerns.

In mid-September, the company announced it had chosen  Oracle  as its partner to secure its data in the U.S., with the software giant and  Walmart Inc.  taking ownership stakes in a new company that would run TikTok's U.S. operations.

A key sticking point that still needs to be ironed out is the size of the ownership stakes for ByteDance and its new U.S. investors, according to people familiar with the discussions and internal thinking.

The negotiations have already helped  Walmart  forge closer ties to TikTok, something that has motivated the retailer from the beginning, according to people familiar with the situation.  Walmart  is working toward partnering with TikTok on providing warehouse and shipment support for sales made through the app, and  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon  now has relationships with TikTok's executive leadership, some of the people said.

Executives at  Oracle , who see TikTok as a major customer for its cloud business, expect the deal to be completed before the end of the year, a person close to the company said.

ByteDance kept its lawsuits against the U.S. government active in part to ensure that the app didn't face a shutdown as the negotiations took place.

Mr. Trump would still prefer to get rid of TikTok in the U.S. altogether, though his attention has shifted to other matters, the senior administration official said. The official said that even though Mr. Trump gave his preliminary approval to a deal, he has never been fully sold on the idea because he doesn't want a transaction that could be perceived as benefiting  China .

Inside the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin , Attorney General  William Barr  and  White House  economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  have all said in meetings at times that they believe a deal could work, while  White House  adviser and  China  hawk  Peter Navarro  has advised Mr. Trump to avoid a deal, according to the senior administration official.

TikTok believes it will still likely need to divest its American operations or face persistent questions about its handling of U.S. data, according to people familiar with the matter.

A deal must ultimately get signoff from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and Mr. Trump, as well as the Chinese government.

The lawsuit was designed in part to put a human face on TikTok. Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey's ""Without Me"" recorded in the basement studio at his parents' house earned him thousands of early followers.

Now more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

""TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don't have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business,"" he said. ""I felt like I needed to fight"" for TikTok.

Mr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.

As threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.

In September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",t2_64kbe7ff,False,,0,False,How Three TikTok Stars Beat Back U.S. Plans to Ban the App,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k1lmzt,False,dark,0.45,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606447611.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.

APXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.

'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'

Addressable market: $33 billion by 2022. 

The company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. 

**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**

Management: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. 

Big name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, 

Big advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.

This seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \*cough\* PLTR \*cough\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.

The SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.

I got in at 10 and 15. Way before the hype started and just after Cathie Wood. I really believe this is a great company with a solid product. However as a developer myself there is things I do see as a problem.

Palantir is an analytic infrastructure to companies, they are invaluable to companies that hold a big amount of data but has no plan or way to actually structure that data. I believe once you start using Palantirs products it's very hard to quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The product**

In order for Palantir to sell their product they literally have to get their FDE ([https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers](https://www.palantir.com/careers/teams/forward-deployed-software-engineers)) onsight. 

A lot of people have no idea what the hell Palantir does. They don't have a massive database where you just can pick out data from and spy on people. What they do is extract the companies data from different sources, structured and unstructured. Clean it and run it through various ML models in order to make sense of it. What they are actually are doing is building these huge interconnected pipelines between all the datapoints, things that had no connection before suddenly do. This is MASSIVE for companies, they can ask the right questions now. The have the answers infront of them, they just have to ask for it.

**The issue**

My whole problem with Palantir is that they are heavily dependent on this process, they can't just sell a product and one the same day have it working. They actually have to process the data for a few weeks before they have a working product, this is basically consulting. It's not scalable, it's customizable. They need units on the ground all the time for new contracts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now from my understanding it's actually improving, they are quicker and quicker with integrating new customers but I just can't see how they will scale as fast as people think they will. I don't think they can grow at an amazing pace.

&lt;p&gt;The beleaguered U.S. labor market is absorbing a fresh wave of jobless workers, with 778,000 new unemployment claims filed in the latest week, as soaring COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths lead states and cities to clamp down on public life.&lt;/p&gt;

In comparison, Ford recalled 1.3 mil vehicles from 2014 to 2018 while selling 32.2 mil vehicles in the same time period. Fiat Chrysler also recalled 5.3 mil vehicles made between 2014 and 2018 while logging vehicle sales quantity of more than 400 mil over that period of time. Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/). This means an average of about 1-4% recall per new vehicle sale.

,investing,"I have around 7k USD in Tesla right now, which is basically all my savings, and as you all know it's been going up a lot since the announcement that they would be added to the S&amp;P list.

Yesterday I figured that this growth would probably continue for the rest of December, since they still need to actually be added to the list. So I thought it would be a good idea to open up a loan with my bank for about 3k and invest it into Tesla. Because you know, leverage!

I believed this could play out in 2 ways.

1. Either Tesla goes up a bunch in the next month and I can pay back my loan with basically 0% interest and let the rest of my profit sit in Tesla.
2. Tesla doesn't go up immediately, or maybe even dip down a bit, and I just let my loan sit there. I have 18 months to pay it back and if I do that then it'll cost me 200 USD interest. But I feel relatively confident that in those 18 months I'll have made more than 200 USD from rising Tesla stock.

But this morning when I woke up I thought, hmmm, what if the stock actually plummets when they get added to the S&amp;P list, because maybe that's the exact moment that a lot of people will think it's the best time to sell their Tesla stock to make some money. I'm a bit scared of that scenario. Even though maybe I have nothing to be afraid of if I just let my money sit there for the full 18 months.

&lt;p&gt;Generally I have a target ROI / timeline approach when it comes to investing. Generally, I take gains in a tiered structure, especially if I&amp;#39;m taking a risk in a meme stock. Then I tend to hold the rest for a while. What approach do you usually take? My portfolio is straight equities... stocks and ETFs, no derivatives. Although lately I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about hedging against FX fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Dividend yield is currently at around 5% annual. Non-GAAP PE is at 11.52 (but GAAP EPS is negative for the last year). Hit the bottom at 19.99 back in March and is up 50% since then at around 33.

I like that it is a decidedly old school, non-tech company to provide some balance with the tech heavy indexes. I would not expect huge growth moving forward, but the dividend yield means that matters a bit less. 

From reading up on the history, it seems that they were caught by a combination of misplaying the trend towards less processed foods while being spread too thin (yes, I went there) across too many brands and products. Berkshire then stepped in at the worst time thinking they were getting a classic Buffett value play and then basically ran them into the ground with things like Kraft Heinz merger and attempts to cut costs. 2019 was a particularly ugly year with losses, a dividend cut, and an SEC probe into accounting practices. 

That prompted a C-suite reboot and reassessment in strategy and things seem to be looking up since.

,investing,"Square has been a hot stock in recent months.  The 317x trailing earnings is a fair point.  Would love to hear opinions on why this guy is right and why he is wrong.

What happened
Shares of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock surged 4.9% in Wednesday afternoon trading, as of 1:40 p.m. EST, after the company announced it has reached a ""definitive agreement"" to acquire the Credit Karma Tax unit of consumer credit report provider Credit Karma.

So what
Square will acquire the free tax-filing service and add it to its own Cash App subsidiary in a deal valued at $50 million, cash. In a statement, Square explained that its new acquisition ""will expand Cash App's diverse ecosystem of financial tools -- which currently includes peer-to-peer payments, Cash Card, direct deposit, as well as fractional investing ... giving customers another way to manage their finances from their pocket.""  

In so doing, Square will also clear the way for Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to proceed with its own planned acquisition of the rest of Credit Karma. The U.S. Department of Justice had been holding up this latter acquisition, telling Intuit it could acquire Credit Karma, but only if the latter first divested its tax-filing business.  

Now what
This is good news for both companies. But is it good enough news to justify investors valuing Square at roughly $3.7 billion more in market capitalization today than the stock was worth yesterday? All because of a $50 million acquisition to the business?

I don't think so. And with Square stock now valued at a staggering 317 times trailing earnings, I think I'd be more inclined to use today's share price spike as an opportunity to exit Square stock than to buy any more.

Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will serve as the 78th Treasury Secretary of the U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported Monday afternoon, citing people familiar with President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team.

Yellen, 74, will have her work cut out for her, with the U.S. economy in the midst of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. But Yellen’s deep experience with macroeconomics, in addition to her familiarity with the inner workings of Washington, could prove to be useful tools as the Biden administration takes a swing at a fiscal response to the crisis.

,investing,"Hi community!

Have been thinking about this for some time now. Thought r/investing might also be interested to brainstorm with me on this. I try to keep it short and simple.

\- So current thesis is, that as Tesla will be included in SP500 in December, the price of stock will keep on rising from the buying pressure of index funds that must include the stock.

\- Back in September, decision not to include Tesla, caused more than 30% sell off (although there were other reasons for more than 30% retracement, such as market wide sell-off etc.).

Now lets make few assumptions and **please not let argue about those**, because i would rather love to see some theories on the subject i am about to propose. The assumptions are as follows:

\- Tesla stock price is in a bubble.

\- Decision committee that decides on inclusion, is not stupid.

\- Fund managers + committee and other parties involved talk to each other, are not stupid either.

\- Before mainstream and retail is informed, fund managers get the information somewhat earlier (lets please not argue about the legal aspects of this assumption).

Now what i am thinking, funds would like to avoid buying an asset with inflated value and would prefer to have as low entry point as possible. Now i am thinking, if i was party involved in either the decision making of inclusion and/or fund manager, what would my game plan be in October and at the start of November. 

So what i came up with as my best guess. My best game strategy would be to in this instance to purchase significant amount of \~monthly call options around the strike price of $500, knowing that once the information is made public, those call options would bring in a very nice profit and would help to significantly lower my entry price. Now somewhere around now, as price keeps steadily increasing, i would buy montly put options with a strike price around $400. And in a week or two, once i have enough, as pre accepted strategy with committee, i would make a public statement about ""some ongoing research into SP inclusion and therefore until further notice, Tesla will not be included"". Share price would plummet significantly and i would again make a nice 10x for example, on my put options. Now with the profits from both calls and those calls further invested into puts, i have more than enough profits, to now either purchase directly or exercise the options to have far more reasonable entry price for the stock. In a small cap entry, i would not even think (much) about such theory, but Tesla is currently just about to take worlds 9th place by market cap and its weight and effect on funds and SP500 is significant. Tin foil hat off.

So community, what do you think about my strategy/thesis as a theoretical commitee/fund manager member and what are your thoughts about commitee and fund managers going through October and November, knowing very well, that if by doing anything by the rules, they would need to buy into very inflated asset and overall, inclusion decision at current time would not be the smartest decision. Do you think they even care or need to care on these matters? Maybe they wont and that would make my whole point invalid.

I would be very interested in your thoughts on this matter. And please again, lets try not discuss and argue about those 4 assumptions i made above.

&lt;p&gt;All I could find where state specific municipal bond ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hello all,

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM. 

1. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
2. Li Auto ($LI)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&amp;P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the ""old boys club"" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. 

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Nio Inc ($NIO)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
5. Li Auto ($LI)

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)
2. General Motors ($GM)
3. Li Auto ($LI)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard 

---

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!

The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc""&gt;Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone&amp;#39;s concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png""&gt;Supply Chain Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Motors ($GM) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla ($TSLA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nio Inc ($NIO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto ($LI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don&amp;#39;t regret it, however I don&amp;#39;t look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I&amp;#39;m currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

What does the community think about investment in carbon credits? 

In the coming period, as governments crackdown on greenhouse gas production, they will need companies to be net carbon neutral. As the companies strive to reduce the carbon production, they will have a period of needing to purchase carbon credits to offset the current levels of production.

In this realm lays the carbon credits. To offset the current levels of games produced, they buy carbon credits.

Now I'm not sure how consumers/traders can invest in carbon credits. There is one ETF that i found KRBN which allows such.

,investing,"I have not done much due diligence here but the first 2 hours of research gave me an impression that Nuclear Power might be a new game in town. How? (this topic mostly focuses in the US) 

**1)** Climate change, a carbon-free world has been pushing us towards investing in renewable energy for the past few years mostly solar and wind but the investment in those has not been great and coal produced energy has been mostly replaced by natural gas which emits 50-60% CO2 than coal but still not zero. So the solution is if you want complete carbon-free is nuclear. But Americans we have a problem with that. Since the end of 1990s , not a single nuclear plant been built in the USA because we are scared of it. Chernobyl, 1970s "" The China syndrome"" movie (btw, imo, the most powerful movie probably in the world that was able to kill the whole industry) etc. 

2) things might change, Joe Biden has a plan. and not the little plan but 2 Trillion $ plan! Joe Biden is interested in nuclear power (also in solar and wind, but I believe those are quite inefficient vs nuclear and does not create high paying jobs as Joe says)   especially in SMRs (small Module Reactors) - which are less risky , more efficient to build- does not require &gt;8-10 years to construct like current nuclear power plants. (meaning less CAPEX, fast ROE)

If we need to live up to Paris Climate accord and build carbon free world, it seems nuclear power is the way. Currenly, US's 50% renewable energy is coming from nuclear which is also 20% of total electricity generated - making the US biggest nuclear energy generator. However , compared to France for instance, nuclear stands for more than 80% of electricity. 

So, the question is who might benefit if Biden goes nuclear (pun intended). Unfortunately, there are not many public companies focused on SMRs . One I could find was NuScale which is private. But it is majority owned by Fluor Corporation (publicly traded) and what I found online that they might have a contract with BWX Technologies (major customer is Sovereign - submarine, navy).

&lt;p&gt;So, the question is who might benefit if Biden goes nuclear (pun intended). Unfortunately, there are not many public companies focused on SMRs . One I could find was NuScale which is private. But it is majority owned by Fluor Corporation (publicly traded) and what I found online that they might have a contract with BWX Technologies (major customer is Sovereign - submarine, navy). Anyways, I could write down here for pages but tried to keep short. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what you think? need opinions? Can there be future for nuclear under Biden admin? if there will be, then Nuclear Industry ETF is another thing you might own.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello  everyone, just wanna give you the heads up that I am fairly new to  this. I make my own DD before investing in a company but I have no way  to know if my DD is good until after the fact. So, I had this idea of  posting it here and the community can discuss the ticker and my DD. I am  hoping that I you guys can pick-up on any mistakes that I am not aware  of.

All the data was collected from MarketWatch, SeekingAlpha and YahooFinance.

So, Element Solutions (**$ESI**)  is a specialty chemicals production corporation formerly known as   Platform Specialty Products Corporation (changed the name in 2019). They  own several business brands: MacDermid, Compugraphics, Fernox, alpha  and Kester.

The company does business all over the world (EUA, South America, Europe, Asia) and has reach to a many key markets:

* Automotive
* Computing &amp; Telecom
* Consumer Goods
* Energy &amp; Resources
* Military, Aerospacial &amp; Medical
* Mobile &amp; Wearables
* Printed Packing
* Water Treatment

I won't go over them in detail, just a few key point:

**Automotive**

According to their website, their automotive initiative ESI:Automotive includes **EV/Powertrain**, **Safety systems (ADAS)**, Lightweight, Interior and Exterior.

Their EV/Powertrain business is directed at Battery management systems and inverter solutions.

The Safety systems (ADAS) include sensors, cameras, **Lidar**, central computer and conectivity.

The remaining divisions are mainly for improved materials, displays, touchscreens, etc.

Also according to them the ESI:automotive has **more than 1400 active patents**.

**Computing &amp; Telecom**

They throw a lot of big words around: Big data, AI, 5G... but **at the end of the day they supply the materials** to build and operate those systems. Which is fine.

""Specifically developed materials that are utilized in many of the  highest technology processors today.""

""High-performance assembly  materials and solders are the conduit of electronic functionality.""

**Consumer Goods**

As more to do with **aesthetic** and surface solutions, coatings, etc.

**Energy &amp; Resources**

They deal with oil companies and **solar** companies.

""The  offshore oil industry uses our control fluids to effectively and   safely recover oil from the deepest depths. The photovoltaics industry   utilizes our chemicals and materials to conduct new electrons as soon as   they are created within solar cells.""

**Military, Aerospacial &amp; Medical**

Coatings/shock  absorbers for airplanes, circuit metallization and high integrity  solders connections for military aplications, semiconductor packaging  methods for circuits in medical imaging devices and chemicals that form  the circuity of medical eletronics.

**Mobile &amp; Wearebles**

""Our printed electronics initiative is helping companies to explore the  **printed electronics market**  with our combined product and application  experience spanning circuit  metallization, assembly and soldering,  precision coated films, and  printed graphics. We represent a strong and  organized front in this new  and exciting industry, and are looking  forward to shaping its  development in the decades to come.""

Again they throw around big words like 5G, Cloud, streaming,  extended battery life, etc...

**Printed Packaging**

This area is all about printing those nice, vibrant and appealing packages that catch your eye at the supermarket.

""In the graphics packaging industry, we are a leader in innovation. With **global patents and trademarks**,  our research and development drives  flexographic printing forward.  Printers turn to us to ensure the  expectations and demands of brand  owners are met for every print job  they deliver.""

**Water treatment**

**Manufacture and supply of chemical and filter technology** to diagnose, treat  and protect domestic and commercial heating systems in **markets across  the globe**.

""Many  of our products are award winning and are accredited with  independent  approvals for their energy efficient and environmentally  friendly  credentials.""

All  in all, this seems like a company that has their fingers in a lot of  markets. Some are still growing (EV, Solar energy, semiconductors) and  other are more well established (Water treatment, printing packages,  Medical) which in my opinion gives them the oportunity to grow and have a  nice fail safe cushen if things go south.

**The numbers**

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|2018|2019|TTM|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|1,96 B|1,84 B|1,78 B|
|Net Income|(81,5) M|78,9 M|121,2 M|
|EBITDA|411,5 M|400,5 M|390,4 M|

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Cap:** 3.34 B             //                              **Free Cash Flow (2019):** 100.7 M

**P/E:** 29.39

**EPS:** 0.48

All  in all, I like these numbers. There might be no substancial growth  going on right now, but as the company pointed out in their last  earnings, COVID took a tool on their clients, and business has not  increased as expected. Nontheless they managed to increase their Net  Income (TTM) and maintin a health EBITDA.

At  the end of the day I am feeling good about the news and the direction  that this company is going. They are not going for crazy volatility or  turbulence, but rather steady growth and taking their investors with  them to the top. I have dedicated them around 10% of my portfolio to  Element Solutions.

,investing,"Hi everyone!

This is going to be my first post, I feel it's necessary because I'm in a bit of a tricky situation regarding the purchase of shares of a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company).

I've been bagholding shares of GMHI (Gores Metropolous Inc, the SPAC) for a while now. The proposed merger will bring Luminar (a private company pursuing to take a shot at a (large) piece of the global market share on LIDAR-technology for autonomous vehicles) public under a new Tickr 'LAZR'. 

My question is the following: The proposed merger has a fixed valuation before (attempting) to going public, and they are issuing shares to the public and keeping some shares private. To my knowledge, this would mean they have a fixed share price when the merger goes through (Approx. 10 USD/Share if I'm not mistaken).

However, the SPAC is trading +- 36% higher than this at the moment. The company has stated that all outstanding shares of GMHI will be turned into a 1:1 equivalent amount of shares for LAZR. **If the merger goes through, does this mean that when the original TICKR (GMHI) turns into LAZR, the value of the shares would possibly decrease to 10 USD/Share (even though I bought in at 12.5USD/Share of GMHI)?** 

Or does the market value of the GMHI shares carry over to the new TICKR? 

To me it's obviously important whether or not I should sell my shares pre-merger to buy in at a lower price point, or will market sentiment 'most likely' correct the new share price of LAZR?

Hope everyone is doing okay today. I've been watching markets for years and have definitely been in tune with 2020's various twists and turns for investors. I usually conduct several hours of research before even considering investing in a stock.

I've also noticed that the returns of several friends and family members are absolutely trouncing the rest of the market. These individuals often conduct less than one hour of research and barely know the P/E, P/S, or business model of the stock they are trading.

Are there risks in these markets? Have we shifted to a new paradigm where everybody should just buy TSLA, PLUG etc. and just coast to retirement in 5 years? If this can continue, surely you would think that pension funds would toss those 2% bonds in the garbage and buy such securities.

$9B, and it’s still not done???

That means the company has to be at least $180B in size, otherwise SECs 5% ownership rule would kick in(although it could receive special exemption).

Since BRK.B is not done yet, we can assume it’s a very big fish with a very large float, otherwise that stock could likely go vertical due to lack of supply of shares.

There are not many companies that fit this bill, which company could it be?

Some people are thinking it’s TSLA but I am kind of doubtful. In the same time, there's cause for suspicion, as huge TSLA shares have been out of trading action and Buffet himself shot the possibility of investing in TSLA in an Yahoo Finance interview(which gives more flame to the fire, since Buffet has a history of being tight lipped and saying the opposite of what he actually does).

I bought 50 shares of Corsair at $17.45, then another 227 between that and $30.It accrues for roughly 60% of my individual stocks in my portfolio, with the rest being somewhat diverse.

My question to you is - would you sell now if you were to gain 74%? I originally planned on selling at $40, but the way it keeps rising, I was thinking of holding until $50 then selling 50-75%. This is my first IPO that hasn't bit me in the ass, and I am quite pleased with the result. 

The company is solid, holidays are on the way, it is THE gamer/streamer company which every kid wants to do nowadays, so I think the ""normal"" price will be between $50-60 when it finally settles down. Logitech will probably remain worth more, but people spend stupid amounts of money on RGB (like me) and capture cards.

,investing,"**Disclaimer**

I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&amp;#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&amp;#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&amp;#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&amp;#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&amp;#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&amp;#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&amp;#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Source (Hypercharts)](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)

&amp;#x200B;

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

[Source (Statista)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&amp;pkey=S1dbei4)

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&amp;#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&amp;#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&amp;#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&amp;#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|160,000|200,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&amp;#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a &gt; 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",t2_2azvb7oz,False,,0,False,The Tesla Bull Case in Brief,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jzhwhf,False,dark,0.82,,public,112,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,112,,True,,1606142785.0,,[],{},,True,,1606168112.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no financial position in Tesla at this point in time and no interest in initiating one within the next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don&amp;#39;t really share the belief. That&amp;#39;s not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla&amp;#39;s valuation as I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Overvalued?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9""&gt;these charts so clearly illustrate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla&amp;#39;s market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it&amp;#39;s automotive revenues is many times it&amp;#39;s current market capitalisation. &lt;a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab""&gt;Per MarketWatch, Tesla&amp;#39;s trailing PE is 978.44&lt;/a&gt;, so it&amp;#39;s not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Growth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above chart doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily indicate that Tesla&amp;#39;s current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it&amp;#39;s growth over the past five years bears this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There&amp;#39;s reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at Tesla&amp;#39;s Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Revenue (USD Millions)&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;30,626&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;24.61&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;44,937&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;46.73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2022&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;55,963&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;24.54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;79,620&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;42.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2024&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;102,526&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;28.77&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock""&gt;Source (Markets Insider)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla&amp;#39;s growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem optimistic, but you&amp;#39;re welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e""&gt;any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions""&gt;Source (Wikipedia)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, &lt;a href=""https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:%7E:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030""&gt;the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030&lt;/a&gt; (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. &lt;a href=""https://www.ev-volumes.com/""&gt;EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY&lt;/a&gt;. Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla&amp;#39;s growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn&amp;#39;t large enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an optimist, I&amp;#39;m fine betting on Tesla&amp;#39;s ability to execute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Capital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm""&gt;their 10Q filing&lt;/a&gt; this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Margins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla&amp;#39;s profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d""&gt;This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla&amp;#39;s past four quarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22""&gt;Source (Tesla Investor Relations)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing Efficiencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing Efficiencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla&amp;#39;s capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b""&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://hypercharts.co/tsla""&gt;Source (Hypercharts)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b""&gt;Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/""&gt;Source (Statista)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124""&gt;t Tesla&amp;#39;s battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&amp;amp;pkey=S1dbei4""&gt;Source (Tesla Investor Relations)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla is forecasting a &lt;strong&gt;69%!!!&lt;/strong&gt; increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as &lt;strong&gt;56%&lt;/strong&gt;. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla&amp;#39;s margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to &lt;a href=""https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/""&gt;Wright&amp;#39;s Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn&amp;#39;t pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla&amp;#39;s improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn&amp;#39;t part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla&amp;#39;s fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s existing products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Self Driving: $10,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t currently available was previously an option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acceleration Boosts

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model 3: $2,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model Y: $2,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscriptions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Premium Connectivity: $10/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full Self Driving: ???

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reportedly coming soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supercharging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as &amp;quot;the internet of cars&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla&amp;#39;s revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it&amp;#39;s not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there&amp;#39;s reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla&amp;#39;s revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla&amp;#39;s profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll cover some other businesses of Tesla&amp;#39;s that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The aforementioned Network Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ridesharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;#39;s energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla&amp;#39;s battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9""&gt;Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift""&gt;Source (Financial Times)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla&amp;#39;s energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla&amp;#39;s targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A refresher on Tesla Energy&amp;#39;s available products:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar Roof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery Storage

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Wall (residential)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power Pack (commercial)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mega Pack (utility scale)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ridesharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla&amp;#39;s autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla&amp;#39;s warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn&amp;#39;t be available to customers of other insurance providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Expectations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public accountability purposes, I&amp;#39;ll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I&amp;#39;m not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I&amp;#39;ll keep it pretty simple. I&amp;#39;ll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vehicle deliveries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;25%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;75%&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020 Deliveries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;160,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2020 Revenue (USD millions)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;30,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;36,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021 Deliveries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;800,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1,200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2021 Revenue (USD millions)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;48,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;78,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2025 Deliveries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2025 Revenue (USD millions)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;135,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;350,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a""&gt;(I&amp;#39;ve said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a &amp;gt; 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are dubious regarding Tesla&amp;#39;s ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla&amp;#39;s ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it&amp;#39;s a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I&amp;#39;m willing to bet that they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I&amp;#39;m sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I&amp;#39;d expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"Hi everyone, I hope this post is OK to post here but just wanted to put my thoughts down in a thread and see if anyone can give their insight/opinion as to whether my thinking is as simple as this. I am aware many outcomes can come from the current climate, none of which can be predicted, but I am looking for your thoughts based on the next 18 months going as such:

(note: I am from the UK, but I think it applies similarly to US/EU investment too)

January 2021-June 2021: Vaccination of Elderly   
June 2021-Dec 2021: Vaccination of second/third ""at risk""   
Jan 2022-June 2022: Back to ""Normal"" (vaccinations required)

**At the moment** I see a couple investments as very attractive. Recovery stocks in the short term and Gold/Silver in the middle term. Long term is too far away for me to consider right now. My thinking is that recovery stocks (mostly travel related) are very underpriced right now. I'm up 10% just this week from them and most of them will have to increase by 300-500% to get back to pre-pandemic levels. My thinking is that once vaccination becomes a reality, all the pent up demand for airlines/cruises and the like will surge these stocks to (or given stocks can be hype-fuelled) or further than their pre-pandemic levels. I personally am pushing for many over 50s cruise lines as I expect them to be the first to re-open given the first phase of vaccination is of that demographic. I expect stocks to soar in travel in 2021, but would be intrigued to hear all your opinions on this. I also personally think property may be a good options mid 2021 in the UK as IR's will still be very low and the bubble will have popped by April 2021 (no explanation needed there lol)

Now, I think what's next? I read last week that UK banks are experiencing record high levels of savings. People aren't spending as much as they were. The problems with the travel industry is they have reduced capital, grounded so many planes and logistically it will be a nightmare to match even pre-pandemic demand. Their supply is going to be drastically cut shorter, but demand will be massively higher. I think people will justify paying more than they were used to out of desperation and their savings account balance justifying it. What does this do? Increases prices and surges inflation. This is good for the government as they don't have to increase taxes as much given the debt proportionately decreases and it's good for those companies as they can recover quicker. It's not good for the average person who has a savings account still at the 0.5% interest rate. Yes, eventually the gov will raise IR's when inflation becomes unstable, but until then, what do we do as investors? That's where I'm going to position into gold (and a bit of silver).. at LEAST until IR's come up. 

My strategy to conclude is as follows:

**Short Term:** Recovery stocks (very under-priced)  
**Short/Mid Term:** Property (IR Low / Prices Low)   
**Mid - Term:** Gold (Inflation)

&lt;strong&gt;Short/Mid Term:&lt;/strong&gt; Property (IR Low / Prices Low)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mid - Term:&lt;/strong&gt; Gold (Inflation)&lt;br/&gt;
Note: I hold other investments so am diversified, but wanted to share my bullish views. Would love to hear your perspective (wherever you are) on this and let me know if you find a hole in this thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

With the rumors of bankruptcy of Danke Apartments(DNK) and continuous defaults by Ziroom Apartments, how long can Long Term Rental apartments survive?

I couldn't bear to read the rumors about Danke Apartments declaring bankruptcy and frequent defaults of Long Term Rental Apartments, so I decided to write another article.

It is true that for young people who are new to Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), they cannot afford to pay rent on a quarterly or yearly basis. Long Term Rental apartments, which charge monthly fees and are simply furnished, are supposed to be a good business.

However, over the past few years, more than 60 Long Term Rental apartment companies have defaulted, and a variety of shortcomings have emerged, such as paying high prices acquiring apartments, renting them at low prices, then the executives flee to foreign countries with the money, defaulting on rent payments to landlords, giving tenants arbitrary price hikes, and charging high service fees .......

At present, among the remaining leading enterprises, such as Ziroom Apartments claims to have 500,000 landlords and 3 million customers, and Danke Apartments claims to have 400,000 rooms and has served 1 million customers. With such a huge number of properties and customers, why is it that suddenly the liquidity is strained and the company has been reported to be going out of business?

In fact, many readers are not aware of the financial model of Long Term Rental apartments.

The Financial Model of Long Term Rental Apartments

Whether it's a Danke apartment or another Long Term Rental apartment, they all have the same basic routine.

The first step is to find a landlord who will waive one month's rent to cover the renovations needed for a Long Term Rental.

The second step is to find a tenant to rent the apartment, and there are usually several options for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual payments. The tenant will usually be asked to choose the monthly payment because it gives a certain cash bonus.

And therein lies the catch. If the tenant chooses to pay monthly, he or she must apply for a ""rent credit"" with a finance company. Long-term rental apartments will generally lure tenants into signing a one-year lease by reducing the rent by hundreds of yuan in various ways, so that the tenant can get a loan from the finance company for a total of 11 months' rent, which will be credited to the long-term rental apartment's account at once.

The tenant pays one month's rent up front, with a one-month security deposit, and then pays the rent once a month. Ostensibly, the tenant does not have to pay the interest on the rental loan and only has to pay the monthly rent according to the negotiated rent.

For example, if an apartment costs the landlord 3,000 yuan per month to rent, he rents it to the tenant for 3,600 yuan per month.

At the same time, the tenant pays an 8% management fee of $240 per month. In total, the long term tenant will receive $3,840/month.

In fact, the tenant is renting the apartment at an interest rate of 28%. This is also a disguised usury that raises the price of the rent.

The third step is that the tenant loan goes into the pocket of the Long Term Rental apartment in one lump sum, and they take this prepaid rent to continue renting, renovating the apartment, and running the company.

Their profitability lies in the difference in rent, as well as the difference in interest.

So if they are managing hundreds of thousands of apartments, why are they running out of money on their books?

There are two reasons for this.

The first one is that they expand like crazy. When they get a rental loan, they immediately jump into the market to grab another property. Once they get the property, they don't rent it out immediately, and they lose the free time in between.

These rent payments to landlords take up a lot of money.

The second is the cost of renovation. Usually when they get a house, they will renovate it first. If the cost of renovating one room is 50,000 yuan, the capital occupied by 400,000 rooms will be as high as 20 billion yuan.

This is an astronomical figure, so while the revenue of long-term rental apartments continues to grow, the amount of losses also continues to expand.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019, Danke Apartments suffered net losses of 272 million yuan (657 million in revenue), 1.370 billion yuan (2.675 billion in revenue) and 2.516 billion yuan (5.712 billion in revenue), respectively. In the past three years, the net loss exceeded 4 billion yuan.

In order to be profitable, long-term rental apartments must be able to continue to operate most of the renovated properties after recovering the costs of renovation.

In the event of a large-scale landlord surrender, or a tenant surrender, the Long Term Rental apartment's financial chain will break (they run out of capital).

This is because if the landlord surrenders the lease, the cost of renovation will not be amortized and will become a loss.

If the tenant surrenders the lease early, the Long Term Rental apartment needs to repay the loan and interest from financial institutions.

At present, the share of rental loans in the revenue of Danke Apartments and other long-term rental apartments is over 60%. 2019, the debt ratio of Danke Apartments apartments is over 100%.

In other words, the debt ratio of these long-term rental apartments has surpassed that of real estate developers, who are essentially dancing on financial leverage.

Since 2019, nearly 60 Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt due to financial breakdowns and mismanagement. After the explosion of a number of parent-rental apartment institutions, many places in China also explicitly issued a letter to stop ""rent loans"".

In December 2019, the Opinions on Rectifying and Regulating the Housing Leasing Market Order were issued, which included rent and deposits into the regulatory accounts. The Opinions require that the rental income of housing rental enterprises shall not exceed 30% of the amount of housing rental loans, exceeding the proportion shall be adjusted in place by the end of 2022.

This means that all Long Term Rental apartments such as Danke Apartments and Ziroom Apartments must reduce their rental loan ratio, which also means that the loan funds they rely on for survival and expansion will be greatly reduced.

If there is no capital transfusion, the financial chain may break at any time. This is the main reason why so many Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt.

Long Term Rental apartments are suitable for young people in big cities, but the innovation of this model has no technical content, and the main threshold is capital.

For example, the investors of Danke Apartments are Tiger Global Fund, Pleasure Capital, Kaiwu Investment, CMC Capital, and Chunhua Capital, which hold 20.0%, 15.7%, 10.4%, 9.4%, and 6.9% of the shares respectively, and Ant Financial also holds 7.8% of it's shares.

Those long-lease apartments without wealthy and generous investors are almost dead.

But no matter how good an investor is, it's hard to hold on for long when faced with a venture that continues to fail to see a profit.

The mandatory requirement of ""within 30% of the rental loan ratio"" will put an end to the wild growth of Long Term Rental apartments. It is necessary to think about how to make legitimate profits in business, not just to make a large scale, monopolize the number of houses, and then play the Internet game of harvesting after autumn.

Didi (Chinese Uber) ended up playing the monopoly, and failed to do the harvesting after becoming a monopoly. What's more, the long lease apartment is even heavier than Didi's model, dancing on the financial bubble.

Before the end of 2022, more and more Long Term Rental apartments will definitely go bankrupt and the executives would flee to foreign countries. Therefore, both landlords and tenants need to keep their eyes peeled, look carefully at the leasing contract and loan contract, and say no to all the overbearing clauses.

At the same time, in the trillion-yuan rental market, long-term rental apartments are a product needed by young people, but a better system is needed to regulate them, rather than letting them fall into this high-leverage financial game.

The status quo not only raises rents and the burden of renting for young people, but also adds a huge financial risk to society.

&lt;p&gt;For example, the investors of Danke Apartments are Tiger Global Fund, Pleasure Capital, Kaiwu Investment, CMC Capital, and Chunhua Capital, which hold 20.0%, 15.7%, 10.4%, 9.4%, and 6.9% of the shares respectively, and Ant Financial also holds 7.8% of it&amp;#39;s shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those long-lease apartments without wealthy and generous investors are almost dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no matter how good an investor is, it&amp;#39;s hard to hold on for long when faced with a venture that continues to fail to see a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mandatory requirement of &amp;quot;within 30% of the rental loan ratio&amp;quot; will put an end to the wild growth of Long Term Rental apartments. It is necessary to think about how to make legitimate profits in business, not just to make a large scale, monopolize the number of houses, and then play the Internet game of harvesting after autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didi (Chinese Uber) ended up playing the monopoly, and failed to do the harvesting after becoming a monopoly. What&amp;#39;s more, the long lease apartment is even heavier than Didi&amp;#39;s model, dancing on the financial bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the end of 2022, more and more Long Term Rental apartments will definitely go bankrupt and the executives would flee to foreign countries. Therefore, both landlords and tenants need to keep their eyes peeled, look carefully at the leasing contract and loan contract, and say no to all the overbearing clauses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, in the trillion-yuan rental market, long-term rental apartments are a product needed by young people, but a better system is needed to regulate them, rather than letting them fall into this high-leverage financial game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo not only raises rents and the burden of renting for young people, but also adds a huge financial risk to society.&lt;/p&gt;

from buying the dip to surfing the tech surge with options, an investor following the Robinhood crowd this year would have a lot to feel good about.

Provided they didn’t follow too long, that is.

Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance. The result is herding that ultimately becomes a drag on those companies’ returns, according to the latest [academic research ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3715077)into retail investing.

 When Robinhood users pile into a stock in large numbers, the average excess return on the day surges to 14%. But this is followed by a reversal of nearly 5% over the subsequent month, a new paper found. 

 

The thinking is that in seeking to make investing easier, the platform’s slimmed-down interface could be resulting in concentrated trading in the most “attention grabbing” shares. That increases the chance of herding which can lead to big market reversals.

“Robinhood users are more subject to attention biases,” wrote authors including behavioral finance pioneer Terrance Odean. “The combination of naïve investors and the simplification of information is associated with herding episodes.”

Robinhood was at the center of Wall Street drama this year as the young fintech firm stirred up an investing [frenzy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime) amplified by Covid-19 restrictions and stimulus cash.

As retail volumes spiked, even professionals started tracking the activity of Robinhood’s 13 million users in a hunt for fresh trading signals. To do that they relied on data from Robintrack, a website that provided updates on retail stock demand, on which the academics also based their calculations.

One idea from the academic world: A strategy of selling a security after a herding event and buying it five days later delivers a 3.5% return and nearly double that for more extreme scenarios.

In fact, the researchers say there’s good reason to think hedge funds are doing some version of this, since they observed a spike in short interest among shares bought heavily by Robinhood traders.

It’s familiar territory for two of the paper’s co-authors. Odean at the University of California, Berkeley, and Brad M. Barber at the University of California, Davis have previously [documented](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/AllThatGlitters_RFS_2008.pdf) a tendency for individual investors to buy stock darlings.

In the case of Robinhood, they argue it’s even more extreme, since many users are first-time investors on a platform that offers frictionless trading and only limited information. For instance, users buy equities on the app’s “Top Mover” list more aggressively than other individual investors, meaning they’re more likely to trade extreme losers as well as winners.

1. Inflated prices. 
Okay everyone knows this. Too many people buying something that's limited in quantity will push it's price up. No biggie.

2. No real increase in disposable income.
This seems to be a really big problem. It's not like people have gotten richer or have a bigger pay check now. This means that people are saving money and investing that.

Why is that a concern?

Because if so many people are cutting down on expenses to invest the surplus, consumerism will go down. If people are putting off buying a new smartphone, a new car, make upgrades to their homes to save money and invest, it is going to hurt the associated business. A lot.

,investing,"Hi. It seems the most important benefit of investing in private real estate is the potential to use **leverage** to boost both capital appreciation and yield. Provided there is enough net yield to cover interest and mortgage payments, eventually, as you start paying off the debt, you could achieve a pretty strong return. Assuming a 2% growth rate in the capital value, with a 20% deposit you are leveraging at 5X. If you were to maintain this LTV ratio of 80%, you'd basically be getting 10% IRR excluding interest expenses/yield. Of course, if the yield increases or you can produce a net yield after interest, you are getting some uplift there too. It wouldn't be inconceivable to manage 20% IRR.

It seems the most important benefit of investing in private real estate is the potential to use &lt;strong&gt;leverage&lt;/strong&gt; to boost both capital appreciation and yield. Provided there is enough net yield to cover interest and mortgage payments, eventually, as you start paying off the debt, you could achieve a pretty strong return. Assuming a 2% growth rate in the capital value, with a 20% deposit you are leveraging at 5X. If you were to maintain this LTV ratio of 80%, you&amp;#39;d basically be getting 10% IRR excluding interest expenses/yield. Of course, if the yield increases or you can produce a net yield after interest, you are getting some uplift there too. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be inconceivable to manage 20% IRR.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"I recently ran into the problem of deciding how to split money into different assets (more specifically stocks and bonds). The idea is that the investment size should be a function of the probabilities of receiving the cash flows, and the cash flows themselves. For a company this could be the future free cash flows, and for a bond it would be the future coupons.

My first attempt was assuming one would either lose all their money, or make a specific profit. I tried multiplying each expected profit with the probability of me getting it (implying that the probability of total loss is 1 - P(profit)), and then doing the same for all other investment opportunities. Consequently, I added all the terms, and each term divided by the total would give me its share of the total portfolio. But there were several problems with this approach:

1. It is too black and white. In reality there are multiple outcomes, not just profit and bankruptcy. If I have the probabilities of partial winnings and partial profits, I should be able to use this extra information for better approximations.

2. It is illogical for special cases. If I have an investment opportunity with a winning probability of 100% and cash flows higher than other opportunities, then my calculation would not tell me to put 100% of my money into it, which is obviously irrational because of the high profit and zero risk.

Later I stumbled upon the Kelly Criterion for bet sizing and tried applying it. Again, I faced the black and white problem, but then also the fact that I couldn't generalize it to more than one bet, because the Kelly Formula is meant for single bets.

,investing,"# Introduction:

Good morning everyone. It is apparent that JNJ is going to win the poll (on r/dividends), so here is the post as promised. The poll still has a little time, an analysis will be done for whichever stock is in 2nd place, and last place. Additionally I am considering grabbing one from the comments.

Anyways, Since this is a more in-depth look at the stock we will be answering the same questions again.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged?
4. Is there strong cash flow?

Let's start by taking a look at the business model and moat.

# JNJ - Johnson &amp; Johnson:

Johnson &amp; Johnson is classified as a Dividend King, they have paid dividend continuously since 1963 and increased for 58 consecutive years.

Johnson &amp; Johnson is the world’s largest and most diverse healthcare company. Three divisions make up the firm:

* pharmaceutical,
* medical devices and diagnostics,
* consumer good/discretionary

The pharmaceutical and medical devices account for \~80% of sales and generates most of the cash flow. The drug division focuses on the following therapeutic areas:

* immunology,
* oncology,
* neurology,
* pulmonary,
* cardiology,
* metabolic diseases.

The device segment focuses on surgery tools, orthopedics, vision care, and a few others. The last segment of consumer focuses on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women’s health.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\-  Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the well known and trusted brands in the world. It it one of the most consistent earnings growers.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Their 3 healthcare segments provide unequaled diversity of quality products for the healthcare industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Developed nations have populations whose average age is increasing rapidly. Older people consume, on average, 7 times as much healthcare services and products as younger people. In addition, the growing global middle-class will be consuming an increasing amounts of healthcare. This will further increase their sales.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company is more resistant to competitors due to its established distribution network and sales.

**Risks:**

&gt;\-  Litigation surrounding several J&amp;J products have the potential to blemish the company’s reputation and cost billions of dollars. There is currently an ongoing talcum powder lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- They are subject to more broad threats to the privatized healthcare industry, to include: increased regulation/scrutiny from consumers and government, plans for more government run healthcare, and increased risk of higher lawsuit costs. There are plenty of other threats to the healthcare industry as a whole, however JNJ is more resistant to the institution of gov't funded healthcare since they provide so many products. However there is always the threat of decreased profit margins as regulations call for price fixing.  
&gt;  
&gt;(NOTE: This is not an endorsement for or against either Government Funded/Privatized Healthcare, this is simply mentioning a potential risk to the company due to a changing environment, nothing more)

# Financial History:

One thing that is really nice about Johnson and Johnson is their company financial performance sheets give 10 years of history, most of the time companies will just do 3, or 5 years, so they are definitely not trying to hide anything, and as we will see below, they have no reason to.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|$65,030|$19,389|$14,179|0.7|
|2013|$71,312|$23,161|$15,123|0.7|
|2015|$70,074|$22,116|$15,200|0.7|
|2017|$76,450|$24,539|$32,183|1.3|
|2019|$82,059|$28,079|$28,579|1.0|

The revenue has increased an average of 3% average, the earnings has increased faster than the top line revenue at 4.7% average, and they are very under-leveraged when it comes to debt, especially compared to some recent companies we have seen (IBM, KO, PEP).

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|14,298|2,893|15,859|
|2015|19,569|3,463|16,113|
|2019|23,416|3,498|17,098|

Increases straight across the board. CFO has increased 6% average, their CAPEX has increased by an average of 2%, but regardless their Free Cash Flow to Equity ratio is increasing despite them putting more money back into the company. They have been using some of their additional cash flow to pay down debt, the debt payment for 2019 was $2.82 Billion. Dividend Payments accounted for \~$10 Billion, and with some of the remaining the company bought back shares.

So ...

1. Is there revenue growth?  - Yes
2. Is there earnings growth? - Yes
3. Is the company really leveraged? - Very low debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? - Yes

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$4.04|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|2.76%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.9%|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|6.0%|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.9%|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|64.64%|

From a dividend growth standpoint, this would potentially be a great portfolio inclusion. With many companies the 1/3 year dividend growth has been decreasing, JNJ has been maintaining and they have strong prospects of increasing the dividend growth rate again.

Let's project what the Annual Dividend Payout could be using a 6% constant growth rate. (NOTE: Just an estimate, not a guarantee of what could happen)

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Payout|$4.28|$4.53|$4.81|$5.10|$5.40|

Delicious.

# Final Thoughts:

From a financial perspective, JNJ is incredibly healthy, they have increasing revenue, earnings, low-debt, and high cash flow. Additionally, they responsibly uses their cash flow to pay down debt, pay their shareholders, and buy back shares. Furthermore, the dividend history and growth is very consistent.

There are definitely some risks to consider, the company does face lawsuits often enough and the details/payouts for those were not discussed here. Additionally the health care sector is more subject to a changing environment due to the expansion/introduction/rollback of regulations and expansion of public healthcare options. Take this into consideration.

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research.

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

And also I use websites like ValueWalk, Screener, Gurufocus, Validea, etc to pick possible stock based off premade screeners built based off what investment Guru's look for.

But before dropping a bunch of cash, sitting and forgetting, I am curious if these websites are reliable and take the work out of manually looking at a stocks SEC documents every time they release financal information. To be more specific, are these website stocm ratings(Zack's ABC's, Gurufocus 1 to 10, ChartMill stars, etc) and guru screeners trustworthy or are they essentially useless, even with the strictest settings which I like to use(Everything has to have the highest score in everything).

And if they are extremely reliable/useful, are they reliable enough to render investment experts like Financal Advisord, Wealth Management Planners and Investment Consultants obsolete or, at the very least, too overpriced compared to what one could get from these websites?

If you're questioning if I'm using the sites correctly, allow me to explain my top picks. I've settled on investing in companies like WIT, MIXT and PRIM because they all have high marks on at least 3 of the websites I named above.

WIT was scores highly for financals and profitibilty on. Plus it was listed as a 3.5/5 for earnings preditability, a 0.97 for revenue preditability. It did lag in valuation, all according to Gurufocus. Plus on Zacks, mostly given high marks. And Ken Fisher, Cliff Assess and O'shaughnessy are shareholders.

MIXT also had very high scores for financals and profitibilty, it has a Predictable margin exp in Gurufocus, it ranked #2 using Zacks and Jim Simon's is a shareholder.

PRIM is rated high for financals, profitability and valuation (though it is a little lower for it's financal strength than I'd prefer). It also passed my screener on Finviz which requires every fundimental criteria to be acceptable (Past, present and future EPS Growth positive along with the Sales growth, ROE, ROI, ROA, Gross/Operating/Net-Profit Margin, and low Debt, Current/Quick Ratio). It is #1 for Zacks and has all A's on Zacks for Value/Growth/Momentum. And David Shaw, Cliff Asness and John Overdeck are shareholders.

I also have settled.on CODA, PLAB, HOLI, etc as they are runners up for being highly rated on at least 2 sites. KOZAY is an OTC stock which peaks my interest because of Gurufocus as it's the only OTC stock(with a good Beneish M-Score) under $30 with a near perfect score plus it has the highest overall score of all stocks under $30 where it's is an 8/10 for financal strength and a 9/10 for profitabilit and it's undervalued. 

HVT is the only stock on Validea that mostly qualifies as an investment opertunity with it being listed on at least 8 prebuilt Guru screeners.

I think you get the picture. So what's the verdict on the reliability of these websites, or is Gurufocus the only website for lazy investors that one should trust.

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re questioning if I&amp;#39;m using the sites correctly, allow me to explain my top picks. I&amp;#39;ve settled on investing in companies like WIT, MIXT and PRIM because they all have high marks on at least 3 of the websites I named above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIT was scores highly for financals and profitibilty on. Plus it was listed as a 3.5/5 for earnings preditability, a 0.97 for revenue preditability. It did lag in valuation, all according to Gurufocus. Plus on Zacks, mostly given high marks. And Ken Fisher, Cliff Assess and O&amp;#39;shaughnessy are shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIXT also had very high scores for financals and profitibilty, it has a Predictable margin exp in Gurufocus, it ranked #2 using Zacks and Jim Simon&amp;#39;s is a shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRIM is rated high for financals, profitability and valuation (though it is a little lower for it&amp;#39;s financal strength than I&amp;#39;d prefer). It also passed my screener on Finviz which requires every fundimental criteria to be acceptable (Past, present and future EPS Growth positive along with the Sales growth, ROE, ROI, ROA, Gross/Operating/Net-Profit Margin, and low Debt, Current/Quick Ratio). It is #1 for Zacks and has all A&amp;#39;s on Zacks for Value/Growth/Momentum. And David Shaw, Cliff Asness and John Overdeck are shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have settled.on CODA, PLAB, HOLI, etc as they are runners up for being highly rated on at least 2 sites. KOZAY is an OTC stock which peaks my interest because of Gurufocus as it&amp;#39;s the only OTC stock(with a good Beneish M-Score) under $30 with a near perfect score plus it has the highest overall score of all stocks under $30 where it&amp;#39;s is an 8/10 for financal strength and a 9/10 for profitabilit and it&amp;#39;s undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HVT is the only stock on Validea that mostly qualifies as an investment opertunity with it being listed on at least 8 prebuilt Guru screeners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you get the picture. So what&amp;#39;s the verdict on the reliability of these websites, or is Gurufocus the only website for lazy investors that one should trust. Or maybe none at all?&lt;/p&gt;

Also, what is odd is the fact that 1) the pandemic did not propell this stock and 2) even though all these social media gurus talk about it and pump it, the stock fell which I believe is just short term impacience from traders and hype.

Here are my thoughts:

Talking valuations is has a sub 20 forward PE and recently started getting profitable. The market cap is just around 8b. Share price 19$.

Financials. It's short term assets cover is short and long term liabilities. No debt. And a future buyback program. Positive FCF.

So, user growth+ a nice product which is expanding into smart workspace, not just cloud storage. Also, they bought hellosign, which could be second to DocuSign in the digital signature space. 

When glancing who owns DBX shares, we can see really large funds like vanguard, black rock and the rennaisance group. Also insiders hold 30 percent of the company and they did not sell any shares recently. One co-founder is still actively with the company and is the CEO for 13 yrs. I love it when founders stay and fight for the company, it gives the company credibility.

Possible tailwinds: included into NASDAQ 100 and S&amp;P500. Smart workspace makes a big difference and people accelerate to it's products. Hellosign gets a DocuSign type valuation. A big fund actively promotes the company.

The risks: google or microsoft focus more on smart workspace and kill dbx product by underpricing. Extending into smart workspace fails and it kills their financials.
Pretty large shareholder dillution in the past. So that growth/dillution is not that great.

Meh expected revenue growth of 8.5% in the future.


Based on the fcf to equity discounting that many people use for the company, and a discount ratio of 8%, a growth ratio of 2.2%(5yr us bond), the share price should be around 23$ now. Price target 2025 40$.

The stock market isn’t a bubble, but parts of it are on fire.

So far in 2020, the NYSE FANG+ index of giant technology stocks is up 78%. The [Renaissance IPO ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO), [IPO **1.45%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IPO?mod=chiclets)an exchange-traded fund that holds recent public offerings, is up 84%. The [SPDR S&amp;P Kensho Clean Power ETF](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG), [CNRG **+1.35%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CNRG?mod=chiclets)which invests in renewable-energy companies, has gained 88%.

Meanwhile, the overall stock market is up almost 11%.

That’s a key difference.

For years, anyone who thinks any financial asset is somewhat overvalued has called it a bubble. The financial use of “bubble” [originated centuries ago ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-TOTALB-501?mod=article_inline)to describe massive speculation that [inflates market prices to the bursting point](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-does-a-bubble-spell-trouble-1389399975?mod=article_inline).

Financial bubbles have never had a formal definition, though, and they are [diabolically difficult to identify](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204621904577017960729384948?mod=article_inline) without the benefit of hindsight. A new book, “Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles,” by finance scholars William Quinn and John Turner of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, helps clarify the muddled thinking on the topic.

The image of a bubble is itself a misnomer. As any kid who’s ever chewed gum knows, bubbles often barely expand before bursting, and they don’t bother anybody much except parents and teachers.

Financial markets, however, can easily heat up fivefold or even 10-fold and then collapse at least 50% in a flash, burning millions of speculators and sometimes charring entire economies. Think of the U.S. after [the stock market crash of 1929](https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-the-buy-and-hold-gospel-to-the-ultimate-test-11572015606?mod=article_inline), or [Japan 60-plus years later](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/23/excited-about-the-nasdaq-record-dont-overpay-for-tech-again/).

Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.

“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “[the fire triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle).” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.

The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.

On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BRK.B) Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.

The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.

Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.

The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.

That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But [hedge funds and other institutions](https://www.fmg.ac.uk/pwc/publications/discussion-papers/institutional-theory-momentum-and-reversal-0) also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.

The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been [updated with a fourth component](https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/Reporters-Guide-to-Fire-and-NFPA/All-about-fire#tri), an “exothermic chain reaction.”

Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.

That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.

“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.

That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.

In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without [technology companies](http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/99_12.pdf), the S&amp;P 500 would have been up only 5%.

Today isn’t much different.

In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&amp;P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.

To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&amp;P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.

I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and [shell companies formed to do buyouts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline).

The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&amp;P 500 also tumbled.

Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like [Amazon.com](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) Inc. That might be the firebreak that this market needs.",t2_m915wcj,False,,0,False,WSJ: A Stock Market Bubble?

Think of the U.S. after &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/putting-the-buy-and-hold-gospel-to-the-ultimate-test-11572015606?mod=article_inline""&gt;the stock market crash of 1929&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=""https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/23/excited-about-the-nasdaq-record-dont-overpay-for-tech-again/""&gt;Japan 60-plus years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than regarding overvalued assets as a bubble, we might consider them a fire. The more it expands and the hotter it gets, the more havoc it can wreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boom and Bust” looks closely at 300 years’ worth of market manias using the metaphor of “&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle""&gt;the fire triangle&lt;/a&gt;.” That image has long been evoked to explain the conditions necessary for flames to erupt and persist: oxygen, fuel and heat. Remove one, and you can prevent or put out a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oxygen of investing is marketability, or the ease of buying and selling an asset. Centuries ago, that meant carving up difficult-to-transfer corporate ownership into tradable shares. Nowadays it’s carrying a stockbroker in your pocket. With a smartphone-trading app, you can buy or sell so-called fractional shares in increments anyone can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On popular trading apps like Robinhood, you can put as little as $1 in &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BRK.B""&gt;Berkshire Hathaway&lt;/a&gt; Inc.’s Class A shares, which cost about $345,000 apiece. You can trade that morsel of approximately 0.000003 shares commission-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second side of the fire triangle, fuel, is manifested in financial markets by money and credit. Low interest rates make investing with borrowed money cheaper, while paltry yields on safe savings compel people to invest in riskier alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, borrowed money fuels mega-billion-dollar private-equity firms buying entire companies—and individual investors conducting small “margin” trades with as little as $2,000 in a brokerage account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third side of the triangle, heat, is supplied by speculation. When prices go up, more people buy, inflaming prices even more and attracting another rush of speculators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That lures in naive buyers who think making money is easy. But &lt;a href=""https://www.fmg.ac.uk/pwc/publications/discussion-papers/institutional-theory-momentum-and-reversal-0""&gt;hedge funds and other institutions&lt;/a&gt; also chase those hot returns, fanning the flames even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Boom and Bust” book completes the metaphor by noting that the fire triangle has in recent years been &lt;a href=""https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/Reporters-Guide-to-Fire-and-NFPA/All-about-fire#tri""&gt;updated with a fourth component&lt;/a&gt;, an “exothermic chain reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketability, credit and speculation are necessary, but not sufficient, to start and maintain a market fire. A fourth component, what the authors call a “spark,” is also needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can come from new technology, government intervention or both. The stock-buying binge of the late 1990s was sparked by euphoria over the potential of the internet. China’s more-recent market booms have been stoked by government policies and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Boom and Bust” shows that most bubbles tend to be confined to a few stocks or industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was true in 1824-25, when Latin American mining stocks listed in London rose more than fivefold in roughly six months, while British blue-chip companies lost almost a tenth of their market value. Again in London, in the 1890s, shares in bicycle companies more than doubled in a year even as major stocks went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, with internet stocks going ga-ga, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 86%. Without &lt;a href=""http://www.ajopartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/99_12.pdf""&gt;technology companies&lt;/a&gt;, the S&amp;amp;P 500 would have been up only 5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today isn’t much different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In proportion to market size—which weights giant tech stocks heavily—the companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 recently traded at 21 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Matarin Capital Management, an investment firm in New York. That’s about 24% higher than their average over the past quarter-century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counteract the effect of a handful of giant stocks, however, we can weight companies equally. In that light, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is at about 17 times expected earnings, roughly 10% above its long-term average. That implies that most stocks aren’t cheap—but are hardly overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t see much cause for concern about overheating in relatively small areas like newly listed stocks, alternative-energy firms and &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-flock-to-spacs-where-risks-lurk-and-track-records-are-poor-11605263402?mod=article_inline""&gt;shell companies formed to do buyouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger worry is that a fire among a few giant stocks can set the neighborhood ablaze. After the technology-heavy Nasdaq index collapsed in 2000, the broader S&amp;amp;P 500 also tumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, smaller companies and cheap “value” stocks have started to show signs of recovery—which, if it persists, could reduce the market weight of blazing-hot giants like &lt;a href=""https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN""&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; Inc. That might be the firebreak that this market needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Because this has been a contentious topic lately, here's a graph that shows the inverse P/E ratio (the rate of return) minus interest rates as well as the SPX level. 


Stocks get expensive when, relative to bonds, they are outside some return threshold. Seems to be around 1% or at most 2%, which is the difference between AAA-rated bonds and T-bill values.


I am almost certain that if you extend this back 100 years, you'll see the same concept: 

Stocks are expensive when they pass below a certain threshold here, say 1%, and cheap when they pass above 2% difference between stocks and bonds. 

As we look to 2021, earnings for many companies that had low covid earnings will rebound, while those that were beneficiaries may either benefit long term (in many tech cases) or compress to normal.

,investing,"It is no secret that, save for a few firms, investment companies fail to beat stock market index funds. While there are a lot of theories about why this is, this is mine:

I believe that the main reason that investors don't beat the market is that popular analysis and investor sentiment regarding stock picking and investment strategy, while looking solid on the surface, is fatally flawed and leads to significant underperformance. Let me start with analysts.

It is no secret that wall street analysts are heavily incentivized to follow the pack when it comes to stock recommendations. *When you're wrong and you're in a crowd, nothing happens, but when you're wrong and you stand alone, you lose your job*. Why bother voicing your opinion when it could cost you your career? Most companies on the market aren't worth investing in, yet stock market analysts are statistically more likely to give stocks a buy rating than a sell rating. This is because of the fee structure that many analyst-firms follow, with many companies pretty much paying analysts to give them a buy rating. Overall, analysts are focused on their reputation, if they rate a company as sell and they are wrong, not only will that company no longer give them their business, but their reputation is significantly damaged. To avoid this, they lie. This is bad on its own, but when combined with institutions who trust these ratings, it is a recipe for underperformance.

Many institutions trust analysts' biased ratings. They buy when a buy rating is shown, and they sell when a sell rating is shown. On top of trusting foolish ratings, most funds are hyper-focused on the short-term movements of a stock. Why do they do this? Because if the fund doesn't show immediate returns, their investors flee to another fund that is. This ultra-focus on short-term price movements is damaging. As Ben Graham said, *""In the short-run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine""*. Short-term movements of a stock's price are random and impossible to consistently predict. They are white noise, a product of whatever captivates the mind of the market at any one point in time. Long-term stock performance, on the other hand, is directly connected to the intrinsic value of a company and, when using proper analysis, is much more predictable.

Also, is it fine to rely on these free apps/services? Should I invest on subscribing instead? If I subscribe, what other stock charts can you recommend??

Bitcoin has one of its wealthiest backers yet.

[Ricardo Salinas Pliego](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/14012146), Mexico’s third-richest person, said in a Twitter post Tuesday he’s invested a chunk of his liquid assets in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.

“Many people ask me if I have bitcoins,” said Salinas, who has a $11.8 billion fortune through his stakes in retail, banking and broadcast businesses, according to the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/). “YES. I have 10% of my liquid portfolio invested it.”

Bitcoin is nearing record highs after more than doubling this year, partly driven by fears that major central bank easing and fiscal stimulus will debase currencies. The digital asset [advanced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/bitcoin-tops-17-000-for-first-time-since-december-2017) for a third session Wednesday, outperforming most of its rivals to break above $18,000. Its performance has attracted some big Wall Street money managers including Fidelity Investments, which launched a Bitcoin fund over the summer, and macro investor [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1704916).

In a series of tweets Tuesday, hedge fund founder [Ray Dalio](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1801626) questioned the cryptocurrency’s utility as a storehold of wealth, but [added](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/ray-dalio-says-he-might-be-missing-something-about-bitcoin): “I might be missing something about Bitcoin, so I’d love to be corrected.”

Other wealthy Bitcoin backers include Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who are [now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/winklevoss-twins-ride-bitcoin-surge-to-become-billionaires-again) worth about $1 billion each from the cryptocurrency’s surge, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Bitcoin’s gains have helped make up for Salinas’s business interests. Shares in his biggest listed asset -- conglomerate [Grupo Elektra SAB](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ELEKTRA%2A:MM) \-- have slumped more than 10% this year, while those in the local [television network](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AZTECACP:MM) he and his family control have dropped almost 60%.

A spokesman for Salinas didn’t immediately reply to an email and phone call seeking comment.

Salinas, 65, who contracted Covid-19 last month, [said](https://twitter.com/RicardoBSalinas/status/1328895703486255104) in a later tweet he first invested in Bitcoin four years ago, adding he holds the balance of his liquid portfolio in precious metals miners. Salinas and his family have earned more than $500 million through dividends from their listed holdings in the past two decades, according to the Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Salinas has also used Twitter to comment on the pandemic. He previously called for Mexico’s health officials to stop imposing “[authoritarian](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/mexican-billionaire-says-health-officials-are-wrecking-economy)” policies to contain the spread of virus and took to the site again to reveal his own diagnosis.

It's unusual for Softbank to be bearish because they are known to buy billions of dollars of call options in big techs, which drives up the prices significantly. He didn't disclose how Softbank arrived at that scenario.

Does that mean Softbank will gradually wind down its positions in high-flying stocks and take up more defensive position? Maybe.

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean Softbank will gradually wind down its positions in high-flying stocks and take up more defensive position? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"# Introduction:

Good evening everyone. This post will be an in-depth look at IBM, and is likely going to end up being a bit lengthy. The stock is in a bit of a weird position, there is no doubt there will be people on both sides of the fence when looking at this stock. First we will take a look at the business for those unfamiliar, then the financials, and lastly their potential road ahead.

There will be a few questions we are looking to answer:

1. Is there revenue growth?
2. Is there earnings growth?
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt)
4. Is there strong cash flow?

# IBM - International Business Machines:

International Business Machines' mdel is to be a part of everything IT's enterprise needs. The company primarily sells:

* Infrastructure services (37% of revenue),
* Software (29% of revenue),
* IT services (23% of revenue),
* Hardware (8% of revenues).

IBM operates in 175 countries and has over 80,000 business partners to service 5,200 clients – which includes 95% of all Fortune 500. IBM’s outward impact is substantial. For example, IBM manages 90% of all credit card transactions globally and is responsible for 50% of all wireless connections in the world.

**Strengths:**

&gt;\- The company has been able to use its large free cash flow to invest heavily in the future (R&amp;D and acquisitions) as well as buy back significant amounts of its own stock. Additionally the cash flow is allow the company to transition its larger customer base from old lower margin businesses to new higher margin, higher growth products and services.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The company consistently tops the annual list of U.S. patent beneficiaries.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- The acquisition of Red Hat is transforming the company toward new Cloud technology.

**Risks:**

&gt;\- IBM’s old mainframe business is in a long term decline. As we will see in the next section, over the last 10 years the company’s Revenue growth is negative, Cash Flow from Operations (CFO) is barely positive.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- While the stock share buybacks were listed as a positive, they are also a negative.  IBM's Earnings Per Share (EPS) is only positive because they bought back so many shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- And most importantly, data and analytics businesses face fierce competition from corporations such as Amazon,  Microsoft, and others.

# Financial History:

There is going to be a lot to unpack here, let's look at the general trend here.

|Year|Revenue|EBITDA|Debt|Debt / Earning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|106,916|26,361|27,163|1.0|
|2013|98,368|27,478|29,680|1.4|
|2015|81,741|20,372|38,702|1.9|
|2016|79,919|18,551|40,902|2.2|
|2017|79,139|16,223|45,086|2.8|
|2018|79,591|16,711|42,656|2.6|
|2019|77,147|16,844|66,883|4.0|

The revenue has decreased approx 4% each year over the last decade, earnings has also decreased down to $16 Billion while their debt has ballooned to over $66.8 Billion setting the current debt/earnings ratio to 4x...big ouch.

Looking back at the first chart there are two things that need to be pointed out. Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn't been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.

So let's answer some of the questions.

1. Is there revenue growth?  - No
2. Is there earnings growth? - No
3. Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt
4. Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.

This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Cash Flow from Operations|Capital Expenditures|FCF/E Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2011|19,846|4,108|16,787|
|2015|17,225|3,579|13,594|
|2019|14,770|2,286|31,365|

What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating \~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting \~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.

At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been \~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.

Let's quickly look into where the money is coming from.

**Revenue:**

|Revenue Sector|2018|2019|Year-Year Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cloud &amp; Cognitive Software|22,209|23,200|\+6%|
|Global Business Services|16,595|16,634|\+2.4%|
|Global Tech Services|29,146|27,361|\-3.7%|

Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud &amp; Business services growing at a \~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.

This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.

# So what's the big if?

The big ""IF"" is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.

# Some other numbers:

NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.

|Current Annual Payout / Share|$6.52|
|:-|:-|
|Yield|5.84%|
|10 Yr Div Growth Rate|11.6|
|3 Yr Div Growth Rate|5.3|
|1 Yr Div Growth Rate|3.5|
|Current EPS Payout Ratio|72.77%|
|Years on Consecutive Div Increase|25 Years|

As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.

# Final Thoughts:

IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.

Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won't be talking about it in detail here)

Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?

I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone's opinion about the company?

As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!

EDIT: Fixed some math errors. Thanks everyone for the comments, remember this post wasn't an endorsement or recommendation to buy or sell, just something to get brain juices going.

Firstly, the decline in revenue and EBITDA has been leveling out, from 2017-2019 we can see there hasn&amp;#39;t been as much of a decline. Secondly, the ballooning in debt in 2019 is attributed to IMB acquiring Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s answer some of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there revenue growth?  - No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there earnings growth? - No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the company really leveraged? (Low/High debt) - Lots of Debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there strong cash flow? Hmmm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things are going to get interesting. and less gloomy. (But it is still gloomy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Cash Flow from Operations&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Capital Expenditures&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;FCF/E Ratio&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2011&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;19,846&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;4,108&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,787&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;17,225&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3,579&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;13,594&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;14,770&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;2,286&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;31,365&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is really interesting, and a little weird here is they are generating ~$15 Billion in cash flow, and only putting ~$2.3 Billion back into the company, leaving around $12 Billion of free cash flow. When we look at their Free Cash to Equity we can see this has sharply rose, despite declining revenue and earnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the current stock levels the free cash flow yield over the last decade has been ~11%. So if they can continue to stop their decline, or even turn around at this point there could be strong profit potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s quickly look into where the money is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Revenue Sector&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2018&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;2019&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Year-Year Change&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Cloud &amp;amp; Cognitive Software&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;22,209&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;23,200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;+6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Global Business Services&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,595&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;16,634&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;+2.4%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Global Tech Services&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;29,146&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;27,361&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;-3.7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at only the top 3 of their revenue sectors, we can see their Cloud &amp;amp; Business services growing at a ~2.65% weighted, and their Tech dropping by 3.7% from 2018 to 2019. This is potentially promising and their new CFO and CEO are investing heavily into this Cloud services. From their prospectus they are projecting potential 60% growth revenue models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also does not take into account the potential from their Red Hat acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the big if?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big &amp;quot;IF&amp;quot; is whether or not they can turn the business around from where it is currently at or if it will just continue to decline. The earnings/revenue/debt numbers look terrifying right now, but strong cash flow is what allows companies to survive into the future. If IBM can increase their revenue and earnings, pay down debt, and maintain or increase their current cash flow there is a potential for a strong return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Some other numbers:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Current for November 2020 and very likely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;Current Annual Payout / Share&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=""left""&gt;$6.52&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5.84%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;10 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;11.6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;5.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;1 Yr Div Growth Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;3.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Current EPS Payout Ratio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;72.77%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Years on Consecutive Div Increase&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;25 Years&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands right now, the company is remaining committed to the dividend payouts. They currently have the cash flow to support it, however the payout ratio is already 72%. To maintain this their revenue will need to increase in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has been beaten down and currently sits in an interesting position. It is a global behemoth of a company with a wide moat, it is very intertwined in many different services, yet, over the last decade, it has languished financially under their previously poor leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking this up, maintaining your current position, or staying far away depends on your personal risk tolerance. They have been declining, but the decline has slowed. Their growth in the Cloud sector is becoming more profitable, but it has many competitors there. There was a change in upper leadership. They have high levels or debt, but high levels of cash flow. So much is going on. (They are also involved in crypto - Stellar Lumens for those interested in that, won&amp;#39;t be talking about it in detail here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you need to ask yourself, do you believe in this company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone found this post interesting, please supplement this with your own research. What is everyone&amp;#39;s opinion about the company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for reading, and have a good day/night!&lt;/p&gt;

ARK Investment Management-a privately-held asset manager founded just six years ago-has been in the spotlight a lot this year thanks to its vocal founder and stellar investment record.

A recent regulatory filing suggests that Resolute Investment Managers—ARK funds’ U.S. distributor—plans to take control of the company early next year.

**It turns out that when Resolute acquired a minority stake in ARK in 2016, the deal also included an option that allows Resolute to purchase a controlling stake—if it wants—before the option expires in early 2021.** ARK, which manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion across seven exchange-traded funds, has more than tripled its assets in the past year alone. Now, Resolute is exercising its option to own a bigger piece of the cake.

Cathie Wood, ARK’s founder and CEO who owns 50% to 75% of the firm, is fighting the takeover. In a statement, Wood said she is “disappointed” about Resolute’s “unwelcome notice” of its intention to seize control of the business. “The remarkable success of our team is rooted firmly in a culture of transparency, collaboration, and employee ownership,” she wrote. “We do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK’s stakeholders.” Wood didn’t comment beyond the statement.

Ben Johnson, director of global exchange-traded fund research for Morningstar, highly doubts there will be a management change at ARK. ""Resolute has been operating largely at arm's length, distributing products and opening doors for the ARK team and not necessarily meddling in their day-to-day affairs and telling them how to manage money,"" says Johnson, ""What they want to do is to exercise the call option that is very much in the money right now, that's what they signed up on.""",t2_cotyg,False,,0,False,"Cathie Wood Might Lose Control of ARK, the Company She Founded",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jx7t8u,False,dark,0.9,,public,114,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,114,,False,,1605809529.0,,[],{},,True,,1605838126.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.barrons.com/articles/cathie-wood-might-lose-control-of-ark-investment-51605699000""&gt;Cathie Wood Might Lose Control Of ARK Investment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Why wouldn’t I write the 25 strike price and collect the nice premium, because they still have to wait for the price to be below 18.50 to exercise the option and drop below breaking even.

Key points:

- In the next couple of decades, due to the falling production costs, fossil fuels will continue to lead as the primary energy source, even with the increased investments in, and generation of, renewables. Oil will continue to remain the dominant source for energy for transport while in the heating sector, natural gas will take the lead role. Faster transition resulting in an earlier end of fossil fuel dependence is possible with strong and consistent sustainable development policies and efficient disbursement of investments; but there may not be major renewable projects that can be brought online in the immediate future. Therefore, at the global level, cheaper fossil fuels may continue to support demand and discourage clean energy solutions for some time.

- Major oil and gas companies are observing development of green hydrogen with keen interest. This is also a part of Europe’s green deal package with numerous investment support policies, pilot projects and a dozen roadmaps for using hydrogen for energy.

- Any major government support is likely to be for projects that accelerate the energy transition to a zero carbon emission economy or transition from the fossil fuels industry. The stimulus plans, government support and the post pandemic recovery of China (which leads the solar panels and wind energy sectors) will determine the pace of recovery.

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re the buffet/value investor do you think it&amp;#39;s sustainable and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imo, I have yet to see inflationary pressure for cyclicals to make sustained gains, but I cant ignore the the size of the moves. Yield curve should steepen and may support some of the cyclicals to continue to gain traction. Overall, have a balance between defensive growth and cyclical/early recovery stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

Some companies like Greyscale, PayPal, and Fidelity, while not investing in Bitcoin itself, have created services and derivative products that hope to extract substantial revenue from Bitcoin investors.  

These large players have justified their choice with the claim that Bitcoin is a good hedge investment because its market price is uncorrelated with the real economy or with the price of other traditional hedges, such as gold, real estate, or T-bonds; and its value is somehow likely to increase, even while those assets lose their because of the pandemic.  

This claim has some rational justification, since Bitcoin's does not have any significant interaction with the real economy or a ""fundamental"" value derived from expected dividends. Its market price is therefore not affected by business closures, unemployment, or a possible hyper-devaluation of the dollar.

Yet Bitcoin was not designed to be an investment instrument, much less a hedge against general economic crisis.

&lt;p&gt;Again, I’m new to the industry and investing overall, currently a first year university student. This is more of a hypothesis and idea I think seems rational but I’d love to hear from people with more experienced opinions. The companies I have in mind are Enbridge and Suncor. Let me know what you think, again I’m definitely not saying my logic is correct and if it’s flawed I’d love to hear why!&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't seen any discussion of the M1 chip on this subreddit (maybe something was deleted) so I wanted to bring it up and hear everyone's takes.

The ARM architecture has hitherto been largely restricted to low power consumption devices (phones, tablets), but the M1 chip may popularize larger, higher performance form factors, providing direct competition to Intel and AMD, who design chips with the x86 and x86-64 architecture, the typical architecture in most PCs and Macs.

Here is some reading I have done on the recent news:

Review of the M1 chip with some context on ARM vs x86: [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/)

A wikipedia article on Apple's transition to ARM processorsr:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac\_transition\_to\_Apple\_Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_Silicon)

Another article talking about Microsoft's efforts to move to the ARM architecture as well:

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few discussion questions:

  
Is the threat to x86 architecture firms overstated?

Which companies are best suited to take advantage of this shift if it occurs?

Does this affect the softbank sale and NVIDIA acquisition of ARM holdings?

Any other lesser known companies that will benefit or lose out from a bigger shift to ARM computing?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Norman, says London has added 40 miles of temporary bike lanes. Nationally, the government has pledged £2bn ($3.2bn) towards new cycling and walking infrastructure. During the summer, cycle traffic recovered to pre-pandemic levels on many commuter routes into central London, even as offices remain largely empty. In 2021 many more commuters will opt for pedal power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

#The math:

(Using Canadian values)

Cost of borrowing = 1.5% + benchmark -- gets lower over $100K

CAD benchmark rate = -0.0037% [0] -- fluctuates daily

Margin requirement = 30% to 50% [1]

Max S&amp;P drawdown in a given recession: 56% (2007) [2]

**So, with expected gains at 7%, and borrowing costs at ~1.5%, isn't this a no brainer?**

Leverage your portfolio to 1.5-2x, and enjoy 78% (7%/(7%-1.5%)) higher returns as long as you can hold onto the position.

---

#Risk:

Having margin requirement raised. Happened during the recent US election. Could push you into a margin call. Only about 1 week notice.

IB will just liquidate you without warning.

A recession could wipe you out if your leverage is at or over 2x if it's as bad as 2008.

---

#Other things:

Potential to earn income for lending out hard to borrow shares (not much)

Monthly fee of $10 and transaction fees

Will be earning money through work to reduce leverage, even in the event of recession (assuming no job loss) so may be able to hold onto position for longer.

&gt;- Affirm filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “AFRM.”

&gt;- The installment loan and payments company, led by PayPal alumni Max Levchin, saw 98% revenue growth year over year, according to documents filed with the SEC Wednesday.

&gt;- Net losses dropped fell by roughly half to $15.3 million in the three months ending September 30th.

&gt;The eight-year-old company brought in roughly $510 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended on June 30 -- a 93% jump from last year, according to the filing. In the three months ending Sept. 30, revenue grew 98% year over year, while net losses fell by roughly half to $15.3 million.

&gt;Even if they don’t charge interest, Affirm earns a fee when they help a merchant make a sale. On the consumer side, they earn interest income on loans they buy from bank partners. Affirm also earns interest on some consumer loans. The rate they charge varies by consumers’ creditworthiness, but often starts at 0%.

&gt;Affirm said gross merchandise volume -- a key metric in the payments industry -- grew by 77% year over year. It has more than 6.5 million customers. Roughly 64% of loans on Affirm this year were taken out by repeat consumers.

&gt;The company plans to offer two classes of stock, an increasingly common practice among Silicon Valley start-ups. Class A will have one vote, while Class B common stock will have 15 votes. Max Levchin, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer, will have voting control of the company.

Thought this was a great video to share to calibrate expectations for the upcoming 6 months to 1 year. It goes through what an economic recovery looks like for markets (the ""reflation"" trade) and which asset classes you would expect to outperform in the scenario. It also goes through the real risk of inflation and deflationary scenarios based on past data and trends. 

Highlights: 

\- The reflation trade is an expectation that a global economic recovery will take place that takes equities (especially global and emerging market equities) and commodity prices higher due to increased demand. Value and beat up sectors will outperform growth due to a recovery in demand and the relative lag. 

\- Reflation and inflation are not the same. Inflation can happen with or without economic growth, which leads to stagflation and likely a stall in asset price appreciation. 

\-  Reasons for possible inflation: Money supply has exploded higher along with savings rates. While it has not made its way into the economy yet, the impetus of economic growth could make banks more open to lending and people spending their savings; leading to higher money velocity and higher inflation. Fiscal stimulus to combat the slowdown could over reach and cause a spending spree by putting the money directly into the hands of individual who will spend it rather than banks who have been reluctant to lend. 

\- Reasons against inflation: Usually there is deflation historically after recessions due to lack of demand. We are likely entering into a double dip recession with increased lockdowns. 

\- Inflation could be destabilizing : Inflation will lead to higher yields for all debt. At record US debt levels and without higher growth, this could make it difficult for overextended companies to roll over debt increasing default risk. It will also lead to a depreciation in fixed income instruments, causing a domino effect of deleveraging due to asset prices falling. This was seen in taper tantrum of 2018. 

\- Yield curve control will attempt to backstop this possibility if it happens. 

\- Good to own bonds at the long end of the curve (ex. TLT) if you are long equities right now and want to protect against a deflationary response.",t2_z4liv1a,False,,0,False,Excellent Explanation of the Risks of Growth vs Stagflation in the Economic Recovery,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jx3epw,False,dark,0.43,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605824096.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9h1Smlrj0""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr9h1Smlrj0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us under which they cannot sell, offer, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, lend, or otherwise dispose of shares of our capital stock, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction or arrangement that is designed to or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition or transfer of any of the economic consequences of ownership of shares of our capital stock, until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of our financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the “lock-up period”), except as described below and subject to certain other exceptions.

Starting on the first day of trading, the restrictions contained in the lock-up agreements will no longer apply to (i) an aggregate of 383,609,647 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68,149,214 shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units. The remaining 1,863,150,291 shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, will be able to be sold after the lock-up period, subject to applicable securities laws and our insider trading policy. In addition, certain record holders subject to market standoff agreements with us have not signed the lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period. If such record holders sign the lock-up agreement, up to an additional 37,369,371 shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, would be able to be sold during the lock-up period. 89,007,617 shares held by our Founders and their affiliates will be permitted to be sold immediately under the Founders’ lock-up agreements and will be registered for resale pursuant to the registration statement...""

Per https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/in-its-4th-revision-to-the-sec-palantir-tries-to-explain-what-the-hell-is-going-on/: “One part of that complication was its invention of a direct listing with a lockup. When a company directly lists on a stock exchange, recent tradition holds that insiders are not locked up, which means that they will be allowed to start buying and selling their shares as soon as the company hits the market. For reasons that are known only to Palantir, the company decided to mostly block employee trading, limiting the float that can be expected when it begins trading.”

“Palantir will lock up about 80% of shares in the company, allowing about 380 million shares to trade on opening day. Eight million more shares will come on the market in November when certain restricted stock units vest for company employees, and other vested RSUs will also not be beholden to the lockup agreement as they come next year.”


******

Questions: 

1) 380 million shares refers to 383,609,647 in S1. Why does S1 list an offering of Offering of 257,135,415 Shares? 
******
2) I read ""Our executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject to market standoff or lock-up agreements with us"" to mean current officers are subject to 80% lockup until 3rd trading date after Q4 results, around 2/17/2021. But based on Soros' statement and 13F, SCM sold 20%. Would 80% apply to former directors (his former employee?) or how else to make sense of this? 
******
3) When would 68,149,214 become available to trade? 
******
4) ANSWERED Given F-share ownership structure, Peter Thiel and Stephen Cohen (the software engineer, not the hedge fund manager) no doubt approved this lock-up period. It is not traditional 180 days, nor is it at all traditional in a direct listing. No doubt they would want to stabilize stock price with lock-up (no ECM support as with traditional IPO) but why time with Q4 earnings (realize answer is speculative)? 

Found this: https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/goingpublic/exchangeactreporting
So basically all early employees and investors are record holders. Let's not waste too much effort on Soros then. Main questions: Where did 257,135,415 on page 1 of S1 come from? How many shares are likely to be sold after lockup?

******
5) Why do FactSet and other sources list a float of 62%? Wouldn't it be less than 20% (B shares not traded until converted 1:1 and F shares never traded). 
******
6) 6) It gets even more confusing sadly....

9/29 Press release which seems to contradict the last S1A from 9/21:
https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements/default.aspx
As of September 28, 2020, there were an aggregate of 475.8 million shares of common stock that will be permitted to be sold starting on the first day of trading pursuant to Palantir’s market standoff or lock-up agreements. These 475.8 million shares consisted of (i) an aggregate of 407.7 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, and (ii) an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units in connection with the listing (“RSUs”). We estimate that, as of September 28, 2020, greater than 90% of the 475.8 million shares of common stock that are permitted to be sold under market standoff or lock-up restrictions consisted of outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of common stock underlying stock options or RSUs.

So is it 380 or 475 and thing bothering me most--why does page 1 of S1A say 257?


BIG PICTURE: On or around 2/17/21 (3 mons and 3 trading session after Q3 earnings release) what would be impact on stock? I can't imagine all insiders duping every share (although would seemingly retain control if choose to retain very few), but valuation was rumored around $50-60 Billion for past few years even before incredible run in tech.

Has anyone ever done a calculation though (or know where to begin) to see how that would change if we allocate a percentage of the portfolio to a stable, high dividend stock/ETF - that instead of DRIP-ing into itself disperses its dividend equally to the portfolio, still skewed heavy growth?

Would that outpace a traditional growth portfolio or still lag it?

I am new to investing and had an idea which i am not sure is good or silly.

As I am new to this game and am not confident in betting big on any one company yet I am leaning towards ETF’s. 

My idea on this is as follows:
What if I were to spread my savings money (which is a relatively large sum to me) among a number of ETF’s I think would be good in the long term, e.g:
Spread across S&amp;P 500, World Market ETF, Chinese Market ETF, Clean Energy ETF, HealthCare ETF 

Now as most ETF tend to boat steady rise over long periods would it not be good to make movements of funds between an ETF that is on a spike to one that is in a dip for E.g (hypothetical):
Moving a large portion of the money in the World Market ETF (which is on a big spike) to the Clean Energy ETF (which is in a big dip).

As ETF tends to boast gains over time would this tactic mean I might miss less drops in value and experience more rises as time goes by?

 I am wondering if there is an app or a website similar to M1 investing, where I would be able to enter a hypothetical group of investments into an asset allocation pie and view the results of those investments over a set period of time in history.

*Epistemic Status: I will be staking Eth in the beacon chain*

It certainly has similarities to perpetual bonds. The main two differences are that your rewards fall as more people stake to validate and the lack of liquidity in Phase 0. I will be curious to see how it will work once phase 1.5 is reached.

&gt;In the world of crypto and Proof of Stake, staking bonds can be viewed as a type of contractor license bond. Ethereum Validators, for example, are required to stake 32 ETH as collateral to register their node on the network and in return obtain the ‘license’ to support consensus operations on-chain.

&gt;By obtaining this license, the validator agrees to adhere to the network’s rules, which is to behave honestly and guarantee continued operations. In return, they receive periodic rewards.

WASHINGTON—Chinese companies with shares traded in America would be required to use auditors overseen by U.S. regulators or face being kicked off exchanges under a plan being drafted by regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.

The proposal, which is likely to be issued for public comment in December, would address the disparate treatment that applies to Chinese companies going public in the U.S. The firms have long been able to sell shares here, yet their auditors violate a key investor protection: China hasn’t allowed their work to be inspected.

Auditor supervision has been overseen by a special watchdog—the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board—since the accounting scandals that took down Enron Corp. nearly 20 years ago. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken different tacks to try to get China’s cooperation with the PCAOB, from suing its audit firms to get information on fraudulent companies, to negotiating with Chinese regulators and issuing public warnings to U.S. investors about the problem.

Now, the SEC’s proposal would put the onus on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq NDAQ -0.23% Stock Market to require compliance with the audit inspections—or bar a new Chinese company from listing. Those with shares already traded here would have a few years to comply before possibly losing their listing.

The SEC is moving fast to propose key elements of the plan before the departure of Chairman Jay Clayton, who announced Monday that he plans to leave by the end of December.

China has said it is worried about auditors revealing strategic secrets held by domestic firms, some of which are majority-owned by the Chinese government. The country put up a new hurdle this year, implementing a law that prevents its citizens and companies from complying with overseas securities regulators without the permission of its own market supervisor and other components of the Chinese government.


To address that issue, the SEC’s plan includes a separate proposal to allow Chinese firms to get a second review of their books by an accounting firm based in a country where auditors comply with PCAOB oversight. The audit firm doing the work would likely assume liability for the opinion it provides, and the PCAOB could check the work.

The details for such “co-audits” would need to be spelled out in a regulation. The SEC would have to address obstacles to such arrangements, including the political and regulatory risks the second auditor might encounter in China.

“How do you meet the U.S. goal which is an audit subject to a meaningful inspection, and what appears to be the Chinese goal of limiting the access to information held in China?” said Paul Leder, an attorney at Miller &amp; Chevalier and former head of the SEC’s Office of International Affairs.

Another wild card: It’s unclear how much China still values access to U.S. exchanges for its companies, and thus how much it is willing to negotiate. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which went public on the NYSE in 2014, chose to raise $13 billion in a Hong Kong share sale last year. Ant Group Co., the fast-growing financial-technology giant that grew out of Alibaba, was set to raise $34 billion in Shanghai and Hong Kong before the Chinese government halted the deal.

The SEC’s proposals would take months to adopt and implement, and Mr. Clayton’s successor and the Biden administration could seek to tweak the approach.

The SEC’s anticipated moves follow recommendations issued by a panel of U.S. policy makers in July that suggested how to address the inspections standoff. The panel, known as the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, recommended tightening the exchanges’ standards for listing Chinese companies.


NYSE and Nasdaq have declined to voluntarily change their listing rules as the President’s Working Group suggested, people familiar with the matter said. Such a move could have taken effect more quickly than a new SEC regulation.

Nasdaq officials felt they couldn’t implement the listing rule without clearer guidance from the SEC about how co-audits would work, a person familiar with the matter said. Nasdaq in May moved to raise its minimum requirements for listing companies from countries where PCAOB cannot inspect auditors, a step that could discourage initial public offerings by smaller Chinese firms. NYSE declined to comment.

Booting Chinese companies from U.S. capital markets would hurt the revenues of NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., ICE 0.36% and Nasdaq. The shares could still trade over the counter.

Both exchanges earn annual listing fees from such companies and benefit from the trading activity that comes from their shares. More than 170 companies based in China or Hong Kong have completed IPOs in the U.S. since January 2014, raising about $58.7 billion, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.


Congress is weighing its own solution. In May, the Senate passed a bill that would give Chinese companies and their auditors three years to comply with inspection requirements—or face delisting from Nasdaq and NYSE. Similar bipartisan legislation passed the House as an amendment to a defense-spending bill.

While the SEC plans to publicize its proposed actions in December, the agency will likely issue other proposals directing public companies and mutual funds to amplify their disclosure of the audit-inspection risks associated with China, the people said.

Come on people. I get that there’s a cynical humor that helps cope with an ever changing market, but these comments make it seem like people expect good news to always mean that a stock goes up, and bad news to always mean that a stock goes down. 

When will people realize that 1) most of the volume of the market is automated and algorithmic and/or institutional and based on deeper factors and 2) the stock market is way more complex than “good is up, bad is down.”

I think that maybe with Robinhood and free transaction trading, lots of lay people are getting involved with stocks and they treat it as gambling - buy before a big event, sell afterwards. They don’t realize that there’s mathematics PhDs running super computers that manage transactions for large institution firms at the microsecond level trying to figure out a small part of the complexity that beginners simplify into “good is up and bad is down.”

So here’s the PSA part: THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT AN INDICE FOR HOW A COMPANY OR ECONOMY IS DOING.

Prior to this, the online lending market is a grey area, with many other smaller products available. What Ant's doing is that they are setting up this regulatory action to kill off other current and future competitors - now you basically a banking license to do this business, and only Ant will have in the foreseeable future. Sure they now have to do things like holding more reserves etc, but they will actually have an effective monopoly in the now legitimized private online lending business with a huge regulatory barrier of entry. In addition, they aren't like the central chinese banks, which frequently are required to lend to certain projects (for example infrastructure projects) which are not profitable.

On the other hand, if Ant IPO'd as a fintech company without any concrete regulations, they are subject to much more regulatory risk in the future, and the down side may be much worse.

In summary, I think BABA is a good medium to long term play.

,investing,"Crosspost from r/wsb 

Hi everyone, I have started doing weekly valuations and daily market debriefs. What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and get paid to do this. 

For this week I look at DraftKings, let me know what names you would like me to do next week as well as your feedback. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings.

**What’s new:**   DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42%  year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced  $131mn-$133mn range. [(link)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm) DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.

Also  with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to  $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn  (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This  range doesn’t include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which  could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next.  Management’s guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all  states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars  aren’t disrupted.

**Valuation Methodology:**  I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week – What’s clear  is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be  exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market  will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market  will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing  on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG’s  market share of the  future betting markets. I believe **DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,**  therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the  best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated  Note  on DKNG ‘Limited Changes to Forecasts’ “We expect the market to  continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much  of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors  garnering a  better understanding of how \[that\] ultimately flows to net  revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.” We use 2025 EBITDA as anything  beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to  disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.

I  try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth   figures for both the market and DKNG’s share of that future market   because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a   pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M   to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly   changing company in a disruptive industry and it’s stock price reflects   expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings’   ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth.

**How is the Street valuing DKNG?:**  Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on  equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a  Discounted Cash Flow  model.

Morgan  Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37  valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech  multiple.

Deutsche Bank models  DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA,  discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA  from their current forecast is worth \~$4 to their Price  Target and  every multiple point is \~$2.

**Our Model:**  I start off with management’s 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit  DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth  rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc.  because **DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23**.

If  the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates   from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to   capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%   EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I   get a valuation of around $39, implying \~9% downside. Let’s look closer:

I  start off by estimating the online sports betting and gambling  market  size below. I go off the estimated 2020 figure of around $3.14bn –  $1.33bn from sports gambling, $1.5bn from iGaming, and $286mm from   Daily Fantasy. Next I grow them by the CAGR’s in the previous paragraph   and you see the results. For purposes of this valuation I designate  this  growth profile as my Base case. I don’t want you to stay fixated  on the  \~35% CAGR but rather to see the effects of the rate on overall  market  size come 2025. We can argue all day about the numbers, but  trying to  estimate the growth of the market to the decimal for 5 years  out is not  an efficient exercise. This is still a nascent market  experiencing a lot  of disruption with no clear predecessor case  studies. We get a TAM of over $14bn in 2025 with our estimates.

**Is this a reasonable TAM:**  Deutsche Bank is a noted Bear on this sort of sports betting TAM Share  argument in the 20bn to 25bn  range for sports betting. They say in  their “A Lot of Unfounded  “Expectations” at a Lofty Price; Remain Sell”  Note on Penn National,  “Said simply, in the period from March 2019  through February 2020, prior  to the pandemic, the per adult spend on  sports betting (GGR/NJ adult  population) was $51. Given there are 240  mm adults in the US, to arrive  at even a $20bn TAM, implied that not  only does every state legalize and  all 240 mm adults can bet sports on  their mobile phones, but that … the  adult spend grows by \~65% from this  $51 level”. I look at the idea of full legalization and spend per adult  in the table below.

To get to our $20bn TAM, indeed every  US adult would need to be  spending $84 a year on sports betting and  online gambling. This ties out  with DB’s 65% figure.

Next  I estimate the DraftKings’ EBITDA based on the market size and  their  share of this future market. An important point is DKNG’s  promotions  and how much it subtracts from top-line revenue. We use 20%  here, but  management has stated in the past that promotions are  generally in the  high 20%’s. We give DKNG credit for being able to  continue to decrease  promotional activity in the future, so for our 2025  EBITDA analysis we  settle on 20%. Just for reference, promotions were  \~26% in Q1 and Q2 of  this year.

I use a healthy 30%  EBITDA margin across all levels of market share  and market size. As you  can see, our Base Case is $785 mm in EBITDA for  2025. Not bad for a company expected to have over negative $400mm in  EBITDA for 2020.

Finally, given the current stock price of $42.84 at close on 11/13, what   is the implied 2025E EBITDA multiple for all these scenarios? 

 Every additional turn in the EBITDA multiple adds \~$2 to our price  and  every additional $100 mm in 2025 EBITDA adds \~$5. If the market  grows  by only 15%/ year with lower market share and EBITDA margins in  our  Bear Case, we get a valuation of $14. Likewise, if the market grows  at  45%/year with higher market share and EBITDA margins in our Bull  Case,  we get a $75 valuation. 

**Upside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations
2. Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue
3. DKNG is able to take outsized market share
4. Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting

**Downside Risks to Valuation:**

1. Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO
2. TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable
3. Promotional activity could last longer than we think and be a drag on revenue
4. Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend
5. Negative legislative outcomes

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I have started doing weekly valuations and daily market debriefs. What makes me qualified to do this? I work in buyside and get paid to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this week I look at DraftKings, let me know what names you would like me to do next week as well as your feedback. Here is my non-investment advice on DraftKings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s new:&lt;/strong&gt;   DKNG reported Quarterly adjusted revenues of $133mn (+42%  year-over-year  (y/y)), which was at the high-end of the pre-announced  $131mn-$133mn range. &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1772757/000110465920111952/tm2031612-4_s1.htm""&gt;(link)&lt;/a&gt; DKNG also reported adjusted EBITDA of -$197mn, better than Wall St. Consensus expectation of -$203mn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also  with the earnings release, management increased revenue guidance  to  $540mn to $560mn, and introduced 2021 revenue guidance of  $750mn-$850mn  (+45% y/y at the midpoint), the consensus estimate was  $776mn. This  range doesn’t include contributions from Michigan or  Virginia, which  could both launch online sports betting late this year  or early next.  Management’s guidance assumes that they continue to  operate in all  states where they are currently live and announced sport  calendars  aren’t disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt;  I continue from my initial  valuation of DKNG last week – What’s clear  is that more states will  legalize betting and more Americans will be  exposed to sports betting  and online gambling avenues and the market  will grow overall. What is  less clear, however, is how fast this market  will grow. I approach this  valuation by starting high level, focusing  on the growth of online  betting markets, and then following with DKNG’s  market share of the  future betting markets. I believe &lt;strong&gt;DKNG is simply a beneficiary of overall online betting market growth, not some standalone idiosyncratic tech pioneer,&lt;/strong&gt;  therefore  I believe starting with Total Available Market (TAM) is the  best  approach for a valuation here. From Deutsche Bank in their updated  Note  on DKNG ‘Limited Changes to Forecasts’ “We expect the market to  continue  to trade shares around TAM and growth trajectory views, much  of which  will be dictated by the pace of legalization and investors  garnering a  better understanding of how [that] ultimately flows to net  revenue and,  down the road, EBITDA.” We use 2025 EBITDA as anything  beyond five years is simply impossible  to predict. Feel free to  disagree with me in the comments and tell me  why you disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  try to keep this analysis high level so we can plug and play growth   figures for both the market and DKNG’s share of that future market   because analyzing line items or on modelling on revenue multiples, is a   pointless exercise for growth companies because appreciating from $500M   to $5B is way more likely than $100B to $1trn. This is a rapidly   changing company in a disruptive industry and it’s stock price reflects   expectations of the future of American online gambling and DraftKings’   ability to capture an increasing share of that market growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the Street valuing DKNG?:&lt;/strong&gt;  Goldman is Neutral  rated with a 12-month price target of $53 based on  equal parts 2030  EV/EBITDA (discounted), 21.3X 2024 Sales, and a  Discounted Cash Flow  model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan  Stanley is in-line and equal-weighted with a price target of  $37  valuing DKNG on a 18.5x 2025 EBITDA model. 18.5X is a comparable  tech  multiple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank models  DKNG at a price target of $48 on a multiples of  25x 2027 EBITDA,  discounted at 5% for 5 years. They note that every 10%  move in EBITDA  from their current forecast is worth ~$4 to their Price  Target and  every multiple point is ~$2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Model:&lt;/strong&gt;  I start off with management’s 45% y/y  growth figure for 2021. I credit  DKNG with this growth next year, then  crucially, I decrease the growth  rate by 5% every year forward, so 40%  growth in 22, 35% in 23, etc.  because &lt;strong&gt;DKNG is starting from a smaller revenue base so 45% will be easier to achieve in 21 than it will be from a higher base in 23&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  the online sports betting and gambling markets grow at these rates   from 2020-2025 (about a 35% annual growth rate), and DKNG is able to   capture a 23% blended total market share of these markets, at a 30%   EBITDA margin and 18.5x EBITDA multiplier (we borrow this from MS), I   get a valuation of around $39, implying ~9% downside. Let’s look closer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  start off by estimating the online sports betting and gambling  market  size below. I go off the estimated 2020 figure of around $3.14bn –  $1.33bn from sports gambling, $1.5bn from iGaming, and $286mm from   Daily Fantasy. Next I grow them by the CAGR’s in the previous paragraph   and you see the results. For purposes of this valuation I designate  this  growth profile as my Base case. I don’t want you to stay fixated  on the  ~35% CAGR but rather to see the effects of the rate on overall  market  size come 2025. We can argue all day about the numbers, but  trying to  estimate the growth of the market to the decimal for 5 years  out is not  an efficient exercise. This is still a nascent market  experiencing a lot  of disruption with no clear predecessor case  studies. We get a TAM of over $14bn in 2025 with our estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a reasonable TAM:&lt;/strong&gt;  Deutsche Bank is a noted Bear on this sort of sports betting TAM Share  argument in the 20bn to 25bn  range for sports betting. They say in  their “A Lot of Unfounded  “Expectations” at a Lofty Price; Remain Sell”  Note on Penn National,  “Said simply, in the period from March 2019  through February 2020, prior  to the pandemic, the per adult spend on  sports betting (GGR/NJ adult  population) was $51.

Likewise, if the market grows  at  45%/year with higher market share and EBITDA margins in our Bull  Case,  we get a $75 valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upside Risks to Valuation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stronger than expected performance in 2021, which could accelerate growth in TAM realizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better-than expected margin performance, especially less promotion activity that eats into top-line revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DKNG is able to take outsized market share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favorable regulatory events and large states making progress toward sports betting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downside Risks to Valuation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considerable stock unloaded coming off management lockup agreements from the IPO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TAM expectations becoming more muted, leaving far-out forecasts like the 2025 EBITDA we use being especially vulnerable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotional activity could last longer than we think and be a drag on revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater impact from competitors, leading to decreased market share and/or further necessitated promotional spend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative legislative outcomes&lt;/li&gt;

,investing,"The United States is an aberration among wealthy countries for its permissive gun control regulations. US gun control is particularly unusual for allowing citizens to own military style semi-automatic rifles, also called ""assault weapons."" Democratic and some Republican politicians have been calling for new controls on assault weapons for at least the past five years in response to mass shooting events. For example, Joe Biden has promised to regulate assault weapons under the national firearms act, the same law that regulates machine guns. Up to this point, these gun control efforts have been consistently blocked by a Republican controlled senate, though based on historical precedent Republicans will not keep the senate forever. Democrats have controlled both houses of congress and the presidency in 8 of the last 25 Congressional sessions and it seems likely this will happen again sometime in the next 10 to 20 years. It is also possible that the republican attitude towards gun control will soften in the coming decade, which may have the same effect.  It seems likely that gun control policy in 2035 will be tighter than it is today.

The US uses an unusual legal definition of a firearm that allows speculators to make heavily leveraged bets about the legal future of assault weapons. Under American law, the only regulated part of a firearm is the ""receiver,"" which is a small metal (or plastic) frame that holds in the other parts of the gun. This receiver is legally a gun, and buyers are required to pass a background check before completing their purchase. All other gun parts are completely unregulated, and online sellers can ship complete kits for assault weapons minus the receiver directly to buyers houses. For example, a buyer can purchase a stripped receiver for an AR-15 assault weapon in anticipation of regulatory change, and purchase a kit of remaining parts later if he ever wishes to assemble it into a complete weapon. Receivers cost between 2-5% the price of a complete AR15, which allows speculators to take a highly leveraged position on the future of assault weapon prices.

In the section below, I go through five of the most likely legislative outcomes for assault weapons and give the expected returns to investing in AR-15 lowers. On the 10 - 20 year timeline, I suggest there is a large upside potential (500%+) with a comparably acceptable probability of losing your investment. If you don't want to read through my analysis, I have summarized my conclusions in the payoff matrix below:

&amp;#x200B;

Outcome, Expected Return, Probability on 15 year Horizon

No Change ,                                         , 0%  return,  Medium Probability

NFA regulation but no ban               , 0%                         , Low Probability

Assault Weapons Ban                        , +&gt;500%                , High Probability

Assault Weapons Ban no Transfers , -100%                   , High Probability

Mandatory Buyback                            , -50% to +25%     , Very Low Probability

&amp;#x200B;

Possible regulatory outcomes:

1. No change. The price of AR-15s and stripped lowers moves sideways and the investor makes a loss on shipping and transfer costs if they resell. This seems like the most likely outcome in the short run, but gets increasingly less likely as you look further into the future.
2. Assault weapons are introduced into the national firearms act (NFA) and the ATF continues to issue tax stamps for both new and transferred weapons. This would require buyers to pay a $200 transfer tax and endure 3-12 month waiting period to purchase new or existing lowers. In theory this disincentive will reduce the quantity demanded and will cause prices to fall in the short run as the market is flooded by manufacturers who tooled up to supply a higher demand. Prices should return to normal in the long run as manufacturers retool to supply the new level of demand. The benefit of this outcome is that the investor gets to keep the guns for personal use without paying the $200/gun tax, but will make a loss on shipping and transfer costs if they resell. This seems like an improbable outcome. Legislators who want to see assault weapons banned would be unsatisfied with raising prices by $200, and anti-gun-control legislators would obviously oppose it.
3. Existing assault weapons become transferable under the NFA but the ATF refuses to issue tax stamps for new guns.  No new assault weapons would be produced but existing guns would be transferable with a $200 tax stamp. This is essentially a reprisal of the 1994 assault weapons ban, and would place assault weapons in the same position as machine guns are today. The returns to holding machine guns over the past 50 years have been huge. The stripped lowers for semi-auto and full-auto AR15s are essentially identical,  but the semi-auto lowers sell for under $100 and transferable full-auto lowers sell for over $15000. However, the returns to holding a semi-auto lower after an assault weapons ban would be much smaller than the historical returns to holding a full auto-lower because the existing stock of semi-auto lowers is so much greater. Full auto lowers command such a high price today because there are fewer than 200,000 registered machine guns and millions of people who would like one. Its hard to say how many assault weapons there are in the US today because the number will depend on how legislators define an ""assault weapon,"" but the number is probably north of 10 million ([https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/09/how-many-assault-weapons-in-the-us/)). Not all of these guns would be registered with the NFA in the event of an assault weapons ban, but the final number would still be huge and so they would not command a price anywhere near an equivalent machine gun. That said, if prices for stripped lowers rose to just $600, as already happened in 2012, an investor could still earn a return of several hundred percent after transaction costs. This outcome seems very plausible, especially on the 10 to 20 year timeline.
4. Existing assault weapons are grandfathered into the NFA but the ATF refuses to approve transfers. This would mean the investor gets to own a large number of guns that nobody else can have, but they also lose 100% of their investment because they cannot be sold. This outcome seems slightly less likely than outcome #3, but still very possible.
5. Mandatory buyback. Gun owners are ordered to turn in their assault weapons for a nominal fee. This outcome may actually produce a slight profit depending on how the government compensates owners. Typical buyback prices are in $50-$100 range, which is vastly less than the price of a finished AR-15 but can be more than the price paid for a stripped lower. Lowers today sell for a little under $100, but last year they could be had as cheaply as $35. This outcome seems very unlikely because legislators considering a mandatory buyback would likely anticipate that a small but dangerous minority of gun owners would stage some sort of violent resistance.

This outcome may actually produce a slight profit depending on how the government compensates owners. Typical buyback prices are in $50-$100 range, which is vastly less than the price of a finished AR-15 but can be more than the price paid for a stripped lower. Lowers today sell for a little under $100, but last year they could be had as cheaply as $35. This outcome seems very unlikely because legislators considering a mandatory buyback would likely anticipate that a small but dangerous minority of gun owners would stage some sort of violent resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,investing,"After long periods of speculation and anticipation, Airbnb, the online rentals marketplace, has formally submitted a public filing for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission. Airbnb is looking to go public 12 years after its founding and with $6.4 billion in equity and debt funding raised over the years as a private company. Particularly, Airbnb is said to be targeting an IPO before the year runs out.

Airbnb's S-1 filing shows $4.8 billion in 2019 revenue and a net loss of $674 million in the same year. In the year before that, the company had $3.65 billion in revenue and a net loss of only $16.9 million.

In the first nine months of this year, however, Airbnb saw its revenue go down by a wide margin as the early months of the coronavirus pandemic brought about global travel restrictions that widely affected its business. The company posted $2.5 billion in revenue in the nine months leading up to September, compared to $3.7 billion in the same period of the previous year. The company's losses also more than doubled within that period from $323 million to $697 million.

As of the end of September this year, Airbnb reported having $4.5 billion in available cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. A significant part of that amount comes from the $2 billion in fresh debt and equity funding that the company raised in April this year when the coronavirus pandemic largely affected its business. The funding came from a group of private equity firms including Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.

Notably, Airbnb actually turned a profit in its most recent quarter, reporting $219 million in net income on revenues of $1.34 billion. It comes after the company laid off one-quarter of its workforce in May this year.

Airbnb intends to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ABNB”.

Soros Fund Management and Third Point each bought more than 18 million and 2.4 million shares of Palantir respectively.

“Soros Fund Management, run by billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros, and Third Point, the firm led by occasional activist investor Dan Loeb, both disclosed late Friday that they own shares of Palantir.

The Soros investment was worth about $175.3 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That works out to a purchase price of $9.50 a share. Palantir's stock is currently trading at just under $16 a share, so the Soros stake is now valued at about $294 million.

Palantir went public through a direct listing of existing stock on the New York Stock Exchange. That means Palantir didn't need to sell new shares through a more traditional initial public offering. It's how Spotify (SPOT) and Slack (WORK) also started trading on Wall Street.

Shares of Palantir have more than doubled from their so-called reference price of $7.25 a share on the day of the direct listing. Palantir is now worth nearly $30 billion.”

“Users of the millennial-friendly app -- the first to offer commission-free trading -- are more likely to chase popular stocks with extreme performance.

The subject of telehealth seems to have an overwhelming bipartisan support continuing post-pandemic. What would this spell long-term for telehealth companies like Teladoc and Amwell?

&gt; This summer, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) laid out specific policy priorities to ensure Medicare beneficiaries continue to access telehealth services even when the COVID-19 pandemic ends. One of these priorities is to give the Secretary of HHS the authority to expand the list of providers eligible to offer telehealth to their patients.

&gt; “This legislation removes unnecessary statutory barriers that restrict patients’ access to care and empower patients and their providers to decide on the best care options,” said Ann Mond Johnson, CEO of ATA. “As the only organization exclusively dedicated to the advancement of telehealth, the ATA commends Representatives Sherrill and McKinley for introducing the Expanded Telehealth Access Act.”

&gt; “Ensuring access to quality health care is more important now than ever. All too often people who live in rural communities in West Virginia don’t have access to the health care specialists they need,” said Rep. McKinley. “It is crucial that such access via telehealth not end abruptly once the public health emergency ends.”

&gt; According to the CDC, telehealth services have been particularly valuable for vulnerable populations, especially those with compromised immune systems or in rural areas far from a provider. The CDC also notes that expanded telehealth availability is likely to increase health equity. 

&gt; “COVID-19 has underscored the need to provide timely and reliable patient care through telehealth services,” said Rep. Riggleman. “I have been at the forefront of expanding telehealth during my time in Congress, and I am proud to be an original sponsor of this legislation that will expand access to telehealth services to rural and underserved communities.

""During the third quarter, the holding company revealed new stakes in big pharmaceutical names like AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and Pfizer — one of the major companies pioneering a COVID-19 vaccine.

According to a 13-F regulatory filing, Berkshire snapped up approximately 21.2 million shares of AbbVie (ABBV), a stake valued near $2.09 billion based on Monday’s closing price. Berkshire also purchased 29.9 million shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), 22.4 million shares of Merck (MRK), and 3.7 million Pfizer (PFE) shares during the quarter, the filing shows.

Separately, the company boosted its stakes in Bank of America (BAC), General Motors (GM), and Kroger (KR). Berkshire added 3.7 million shares to its Bank of America position, to last hold 1.03 billion shares, a stake valued at $28.48 billion, the second-largest stock position in the portfolio.

Berkshire also purchased shares of Snowflake (SNOW) during the quarter in a private placement. At the quarter’s end, Berkshire held nearly 6.13 million shares, a position valued at around $1.48 billion based on Monday’s closing share price.

During the quarter, Berkshire Hathaway exited its position in Costco (COST) — selling its remaining 4.3 million shares during the period, while trimming its positions in Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services, and M&amp;T Bank.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During the third quarter, the holding company revealed new stakes in big pharmaceutical names like AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, and Pfizer — one of the major companies pioneering a COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 13-F regulatory filing, Berkshire snapped up approximately 21.2 million shares of AbbVie (ABBV), a stake valued near $2.09 billion based on Monday’s closing price. Berkshire also purchased 29.9 million shares of Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), 22.4 million shares of Merck (MRK), and 3.7 million Pfizer (PFE) shares during the quarter, the filing shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the company boosted its stakes in Bank of America (BAC), General Motors (GM), and Kroger (KR). Berkshire added 3.7 million shares to its Bank of America position, to last hold 1.03 billion shares, a stake valued at $28.48 billion, the second-largest stock position in the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire also purchased shares of Snowflake (SNOW) during the quarter in a private placement. At the quarter’s end, Berkshire held nearly 6.13 million shares, a position valued at around $1.48 billion based on Monday’s closing share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the quarter, Berkshire Hathaway exited its position in Costco (COST) — selling its remaining 4.3 million shares during the period, while trimming its positions in Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), PNC Financial Services, and M&amp;amp;T Bank. Berkshire slashed its Wells Fargo stake by nearly 46%, selling 110.2 million shares, to last hold 127.38 million shares.&lt;/p&gt;

As we know, 2020 has been a wild year. With limited travel and limitations on gatherings, the sharing economy has taken quite a hit.  


While AirBnb has felt the impact of COVID, I still believe it is the strongest brand in short-term property rentals and in pleasure travel accommodations. However, the combination of the pandemic + a weakened global economy should lead to less travel and luxury retreats.

&lt;p&gt;As we know, 2020 has been a wild year. With limited travel and limitations on gatherings, the sharing economy has taken quite a hit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While AirBnb has felt the impact of COVID, I still believe it is the strongest brand in short-term property rentals and in pleasure travel accommodations. However, the combination of the pandemic + a weakened global economy should lead to less travel and luxury retreats.

https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/airbnbs-directed-share-program-287?c

Here are some important details:

The number of shares available at the IPO price is limited. Receiving this message and completing the form is only the first step in the process and does not guarantee that you will be able to participate.

If more Hosts express an interest in participating than the program is able to accommodate, eligible Hosts may be invited to register by the Administrator based on tenure, as determined by the year they first hosted on Airbnb. Registration will be available on a first come, first served basis, by invitation from the Administrator.

When the program reaches capacity, registration with the Administrator will be closed. If this occurs before you complete the registration steps you will not be able to participate.

Program capacity permitting, Hosts who complete the above form will receive information about the program directly from the Administrator in the coming weeks. By submitting the form, you consent to us sharing your responses with the Administrator.

We expect that there will be a minimum purchase amount of at least $300 in addition to a maximum purchase amount. We may further limit the amount any one Host can purchase depending on total demand for the program and Airbnb’s initial public offering price.

There are certain regulatory and other requirements that may restrict the ability of a Host to participate in the program. Hosts must be United States residents to be eligible.

,investing,"A lot of analysts rely heavily on one or two models they swear by to predict which stocks you should invest in. I have had to use a lot of models in case competitions and throughout college, and while on the surface they look really sophisticated and like they should be reliable, they really are just an excuse to slap whatever valuation you want onto a stock. Most of these models get so abstract with their valuations that tweaking an input or an expected result by just a few percentage points can drastically alter the final valuation, meaning a slight difference between the expectations of the future and what actually happens results in a big difference in both stock performance and earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

Models themselves are a critical part of finance and equity research. They present a simplified picture of a company that is crucial to investors. Yet when models get too abstract and when people rely on models to tell the entire story of a company, things get hairy.

&amp;#x200B;

On the subject, many models rely heavily on ebit and ebitda in its valuations. The issue with this is that while it makes it easier to compare companies, it hides a lot of key issues that can come up. Removing depreciation and amortization from the equation obscures companies with high capital expenditures that suck up a lot of the cash the company makes and makes them look a lot better when compared with companies who have much lower capex costs and as a result get to keep a lot more of their money and put it towards expanding operations and investing in other areas of the company. Removing interest expense from the equation gives an unfavorable advantage to companies laden with debt and high yearly interest payments when compared to companies with low debt and low payments each year. Overall, using ebit and ebitda makes crappy companies look a lot better than they actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

Using models too often and treating them like the word of god is a bad thing, no matter how good they are. Keep in mind though, models do have an important role in company analysis, but too much of anything is bad.

&lt;p&gt;On the subject, many models rely heavily on ebit and ebitda in its valuations. The issue with this is that while it makes it easier to compare companies, it hides a lot of key issues that can come up. Removing depreciation and amortization from the equation obscures companies with high capital expenditures that suck up a lot of the cash the company makes and makes them look a lot better when compared with companies who have much lower capex costs and as a result get to keep a lot more of their money and put it towards expanding operations and investing in other areas of the company. Removing interest expense from the equation gives an unfavorable advantage to companies laden with debt and high yearly interest payments when compared to companies with low debt and low payments each year. Overall, using ebit and ebitda makes crappy companies look a lot better than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using models too often and treating them like the word of god is a bad thing, no matter how good they are. Keep in mind though, models do have an important role in company analysis, but too much of anything is bad. Additionally, ebit and ebitda are a terrible way to compare companies and models that use these a lot should generally should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-11-15/china-s-electric-vehicle-surge-excites-investors-but-look-again

A quick review of the numbers: Passenger vehicle sales rose 9.5% in October from a year earlier, and have grown every month since May. Green cars, like hybrids and pure electrics, are standouts: Sales are up more than 50%. Stock prices for companies like BYD Co. and NIO Inc. have more than doubled this year. New model launches have boosted sentiment as local automakers incline toward carbon-free. Beijing wants such cars to account for 20% of all sales by 2025.

There’s no doubt that the path is toward a greener future, where electric cars and even more expensive hydrogen-powered vehicles dominate. But here’s the reality right now. Gasoline-powered auto sales are rising, too, around 6%, with 1.9 million manufactured domestically sold in September. 1  This segment accounts for around 90% of passenger cars sold monthly in the world’s largest market, where over 20 million autos were sold last year. Sport utility vehicles and other traditional-engine models that were beginning to find favor pre-slowdown aren’t seeing a big rebound yet. 

Electric car sales – though surging – are rising from a low base and the numbers are small relative to the size of the market, with around 160,000 green autos sold in October. Commercial and passenger new energy vehicles more than doubled last month from a year earlier. However, for the 10-month period, they fell 7.6% to around 875,000. That’s partly because some government subsidies were withdrawn or made harder to get last year. Penetration remains low, at around 6%, according to Jefferies Group LLC analysts.

In recent months, Beijing has released incentives to ease the purchase and financing of electric vehicles for fleets, leading to a faster uptake. Production volumes are up – 70% or 167,000 cars in October, but that’s still down 9% for the whole year, according to Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. analysts. Battery installations tell a similar story.

In short, it feels like MLPs may be a good investment opportunity given their depressed nature (EPD, HEP, TCP, etc), but as many of you are likely aware, MLPs can create some level of tax headache, ranging from K-1 filings (simple), to potential tax evasion opportunities for not filing income tax in every state it operates in (uggh). As a result, I'm looking at alternative vechiles that will capture the MLP return while not issuing me a K-1 in the process. Thing is, my options include CEFs, which I have no familiarity with.

,investing,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoins-price-action-rhymes-with-1970-gold-markets-says-citibank-200544659

CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”

History of Money and Gold
The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.

The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.

And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.

However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.

With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.

The monetary inflation and devaluation of the greenback are the basis of Fitzpatricks’ comparison of Bitcoin with gold. The report reads:

“Bitcoin move happened in the aftermath of the Great Financial crisis (of 2008) which saw a new change in the monetary regime as we went to ZERO percent interest rates.”

Fitzpatrick pointed out that the first bull cycle in Bitcoin from 2011 to 2013 when it increased by 555 times resulted from this.

Currently, the COVID-19 crisis and the government’s associated monetary and fiscal response are creating a similar market environment as gold in the 1970s. Governments have made it clear that they will not shy away from unprecedented money printing until the GDP and employment numbers are back up.

The above analysis is music to the ears of any Bitcoin enthusiast. What has been oft-preached across crypto forums is finally going mainstream.

Hyberbullish Bitcoin Targets
Fitzpatrick did not stop there; his price prediction chart sees Bitcoin price at $318,000 by December 2021.

The four-year bull and bear cycles post 2011 and the ascending parallel channel since 2013 projects growth of 102 times from the low of $3,200 in 2018 by December 2021. It reads:

“You look at price action being much more symmetrical or so over the past seven years forming what looks like a very well defined channel giving us an up move of similar timeframe to the last rally (in 2017).”

Fitzpatrick also pegs gold at $4,000-$8,000 based on an imminent economic crisis in another report.

Therefore, in all likelihood, the targets for BTC might seem exaggerated to traditional investors. Nevertheless, the principle theory of a paradigm shift in the global currency market is not new. Economist Ray Dalio has hinted at the debasement of the dollar and a paradigm shift as well.

Bitcoin might be the missing link in the new paradigm.

&lt;p&gt;CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History of Money and Gold
The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

,investing,"TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials markets will provide a better return on invested capital compared other market sectors and will be the main drivers of the next bull market. These industries have been cyclical for decades and this trend won’t change now.

As you all may or may not have noticed, the stock market and especially the tech giants have been on an incredible run as of late. Even though many people expect a general market downturn in the near future, myself included, it cannot be denied that these companies have presented an incredible return on invested capital in the past few months and years. These shares have not been the only ones on a tear in the last few months however, with precious metal miners going up in multiples since the lows seen in march. Because of the way monetary policy is implemented at the moment, with an aggressive targeting of inflation by the FED and the printing of trillions of dollars, I have shifted my attention to what I think will be the next great bull market. Remember, just because something has been going up or going down for a long time, does not mean it will keep being this way, especially not when looking at investing in commodities.

After the decade long bull market we have seen, what do I think will be the next bull market after all this is set and done? Commodities, specifically precious metals followed by industrial materials. We all know that when a currency is being devalued by printing trillions of it, investors tend to take their money and put it into 'safer' investments. These investments have historically been gold and silver, who last experienced great bull markets in the 1980's and after the 2000 dot-com bubble. Now it looks like everything is in place for another massive bull run, where investors will move a part of their portfolio into these assets both as a safety net and an chance to take part in the precious metals bull market. The three decade average holding of precious metals and precious metals related assets in the US has been around 2%, but today it is somewhere between 0.5 and 1%. Especially considering bonds now yield an almost negative return, I have no doubts that the average of 2% will be revisited and overshot, as the biggest competitor of precious metals is providing a negative inflation adjusted return on investment. I am a firm believer that we will see higher gold and silver prices the more the dollar (and other currencies around the world) lose value. How high? Nobody knows, but predictions of $5,000 gold and $100 silver have not been uncommon. What do you invest in? That will be discussed further below.

But am I only going to invest in precious metals? Absolutely not, because while I feel like this bull market is inevitable, I also believe that after the coming economic slowdown that will paint the next two to three years, countries are going to try their hardest to improve their own economies again. This has historically been done with heavy investments in things like infrastructure of all kinds. Regular industrial materials like copper, oil, platinum, lithium, uranium and steel have not been the best investments over the past few years, but an industrial material bull market will change all that. With an economic rebuild comes the need for these materials and because the respective prices for these materials have been relatively low over the past few years, I expect a major turnaround to incentivize the new production the world is going to need to properly get back on its feet. Prices of things like oil, lithium, copper and especially uranium will shoot up and the companies that produce these materials will go right up there with it. I am especially bullish on uranium, of which I wrote about many times of which I believe will reward patient and strong handed investors who can handle it's volatility on the way up.

To truly see how undervalued commodities are compared to regular equities in the S&amp;P 500, I would recommend looking at the chart mentioned here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html)

When something is so underinvested in and has all the catalysts in place to rally upwards, a subsequent bull market will be all the more violent on the upside. According to Rick Rule, one of the best commodity investors of the past few decades and CEO of Sprott Global, this will be the investment of choice for him and all his clients and after looking at the numbers, I can't say anything except I fully agree with him. This investment idea is gaining traction and while it is good to always be diversified, it would almost be foolish not to allocate at least a part of your portfolio into commodities. It is what I will be doing and I expect it to outperform the broad equities market in the coming decade. In a cyclical industry, you are either a contrarian or you are going to be too late.

Now I will share with you what I believe will be the 5 commodities that will benefit the most from a precious metals and industrial materials bull market. These markets are inherently cyclical and after a decade long slowing down of these industries, it is time the cycle fully turns.

1. Uranium

A commodity I have talked about on here at length (if you want to know the details, check my post history) and a commodity that I feel like offers the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment one can make in the current market. In short, uranium is used to fuel nuclear power plants, which are in turn responsible for around 15% of all the power generation in the US and 10% globally. The amount of power plants is growing, mostly in Asia, but the supply has dwindled because of low prices. The price of the commodity has to at the very least double from here to incentivize the new production needed to keep the lights on. There are only a few miners left in this sector and it has a total market cap of around 12 billion dollars, which is ridiculously low for something that provides so much value to power generation. When the general investment community and institutional investors decide to invest in uranium, it will be like moving the contents of the Hoover Dam through a straw.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Cameco (CCJ), Energy Fuels (UUUU) and Denison Mines (DNN)

2. Silver

Often seen as the little brother to gold, I am more bullish on silver than gold for the simple reason that silver is used widely for industrial materials. From solar panels to phones and from medicine to photography, silver is a metal that has many uses and is thus not easily replicable. It is also the case the silver is often not produced as a separate product, but mostly as a side product when mining for things like gold and copper. Add to that the fact that silver can often not be recycled and mostly ends up on the waste dump with the electronics it is in, makes this commodity scarce. The scarcity of this commodity means that if supply is not ramped up significantly, the price will go up because of the enormous demand for this metal. Lastly, silver is also often seen as a hedge against inflation just like gold, which can be another good reason to invest in it seeing how much money is being printed.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Pan American Silver (PAAS), First Majestic Silver (AG) and SSR Mining (SSRM)

3. Copper

Probably the most commonly used commodity on this list, copper is used in almost every single electrical device or contraption you can think of. Copper is used because it conducts electricity and heat extremely well, making it a core component in and ever more electrified world. The more we as a society focus on electricity to meet our everyday needs, from electric vehicles to the devices we used to read this very post, the more we will rely on copper. It is the same story as with most other commodities, the price has to go up or there will be a shortage of the commodity. When something is so key to our everyday life, it is quite easy to see where this will go. There are also nearly no new tier 1 copper deposits in the world, so bringing new supply online is not nearly as easy as it might be with other commodities.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Freeport McMoran (FCX), Rio Tinto (RIO) and Lundin Mining (LUNMF)

4. Gold

The thing a lot of people see as ‘real money’. Gold, for thousands of years, has been used as something to trade goods for or to back a different type of ‘money’. Even after the abolishment of the gold standard, this view of gold has not changed and it has been on quite the run recently. Gold has increased from roughly 1200 dollars per ounce at the end of 2018 to almost breaching the 2,000 dollar threshold in 2020. Many analysts believe it will not stop here, with figures ranging from 3,000 all the way to 15,000 dollar gold all being quoted. As mentioned before, with the seemingly endless printing of new money and further debasement of fiat currencies all around the world, gold is both a store of value as well as an investment vehicle. The only reason it is fourth on this list, is because uranium, silver and copper all have major industrial uses, instead of just being a store of value. However, that definitely does not mean one should pass on gold, for something that is considered as ‘the only true form of currency’ can prove to be a great investment in an ever more turbulent world.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Barrick Gold (GOLD), Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) and B2Gold (BTG)

5. Lithium

The world is being electrified more and more and just like that benefits copper, silver and uranium, it also benefits lithium. Lithium is silver colored chemical metal that has many uses, but the wide use in battery technology is the reason I am bullish on the material itself. As more electricity is being generated and more renewable energy sources are being connected to the grid, there has to be a way to store part of that energy to make use of it later or in a different way. Advanced battery technology is what makes renewable energy viable on a broader scale, it is what makes all these electric cars able to get on the road and it is a relatively rare metal in high demand. I expect this high demand to increase further as we come to depend more on battery technology.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Albemarle (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Livent (LTHM)",t2_3zxfdhuo,False,,0,False,"Commodity investing, the next great bull market and what 5 commodities can profit from it most",[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jun666,False,dark,0.89,,public,95,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,95,,False,,1605474033.0,,[],{},,True,,1605481420.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials markets will provide a better return on invested capital compared other market sectors and will be the main drivers of the next bull market.

As mentioned before, with the seemingly endless printing of new money and further debasement of fiat currencies all around the world, gold is both a store of value as well as an investment vehicle. The only reason it is fourth on this list, is because uranium, silver and copper all have major industrial uses, instead of just being a store of value. However, that definitely does not mean one should pass on gold, for something that is considered as ‘the only true form of currency’ can prove to be a great investment in an ever more turbulent world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Barrick Gold (GOLD), Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) and B2Gold (BTG)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lithium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is being electrified more and more and just like that benefits copper, silver and uranium, it also benefits lithium. Lithium is silver colored chemical metal that has many uses, but the wide use in battery technology is the reason I am bullish on the material itself. As more electricity is being generated and more renewable energy sources are being connected to the grid, there has to be a way to store part of that energy to make use of it later or in a different way. Advanced battery technology is what makes renewable energy viable on a broader scale, it is what makes all these electric cars able to get on the road and it is a relatively rare metal in high demand. I expect this high demand to increase further as we come to depend more on battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Albemarle (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Livent (LTHM)&lt;/p&gt;

The RCEP is expected to eliminate a range of tariffs on imports within 20 years.It also includes provisions on intellectual property, telecommunications, financial services, e-commerce and professional services.

Members of the RCEP make up nearly a third of the world's population and account for 29% of global gross domestic product. The new free trade bloc will be bigger than both the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the European Union.

,investing,"I've been invested in $amzn since 2016 and have done round about a 5X on my investment. With Amazon running up to over $3k I've decided to reassess my investment once again, this time focusing on more than just the fundamentals because it's such a unique bunch of businesses under one umbrella.

I took this info and really analyzed it also making a detailed video, and I've personally come to the answer that $amzn is nowhere near done growing.

This is not an extensive list, but here are some of the top areas keeping me attracted to $amzn:

1. Interviewing philosophy. Especially how they have over 3400 ""Bar Raisers"" at the company focused on removing positive/negative bias from interviewing and ensuring they ""Raise the Bar"" with each hire. 

2. How Amazon has stuck to the same principles laid out by Jeff Bezos in 1994. This clearly shows a very deep running corporate culture which is difficult to compete with. 

3. Continued growth mindset, focusing on Customers rather than Stock holders. Even as a stock holder myself this pleases me. There are always stockholder interests and Amazon has always put it on the back burner, reinvesting profits and having a longterm strategy. This makes it one of the best growth stocks to own, as it is clearly still undervalued because of profits seeming to not exists, when its just being reinvested. 

4. Amazon Web Services. This is the largers Cloud Computing provider in the world and tops market share (31%) even over Microsoft Azure (20%) and Google Cloud(6%). Last year AWS was 13% of Operating Revenue but 71% of operating income. It's a key business in a market that's spiking. And 3rd party analysts like Gartner puts AWS down as the market leader for the past 10years.

Anyways those are just some high-level elements I covered during my analysis...but...I'm curious to hear others thoughts?

Are you invested in $amzn and if so, what are your top reasons or Amazon businesses for continuing to hold or buy even more? Or alternatively, if you're not investing in $amzn why not?

,investing,"Hi all, 

I've been thinking for a while about investing in Japan's railways. For those interested, Japan's railway group (JR Group) provides nearly every train service in Japan. The traded groups are JR West, JR central and JR East. 

Aside from providing the services for public transport, JR Group is an innovator in developing the Shinkansen ""bullet trains"", well known for consistently breaking land-speed records for up to 600 km/h. This technology, although slow in development, may pave the road for future infrastructures around the world. Furthermore, JR not only provides rail services but also owns the land around the rail tracks. This makes for income with regards to services, real estate, hotel, travel and other businesses.

Right now, all 3 of JR Group's stocks sit around half of their pre-covid values. Before that, they were consistently profitable for every year that came before 2020. They are now posting losses for the first time and it might be a while before they see a return to their normal earnings. 

[https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/flash-report/pdf/fr202010.pdf](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/flash-report/pdf/fr202010.pdf)

Posted above is JR West's latest financial report. Although pessimistic in certain regards, the report acknowledges their difficulties and I believe the company itself is under sound management. During the pandemic, they seem to have taken the dip in travels as an opportunity for investing into and expanding their rail infrastructure network. 

The bear in me thinks that the images we have of Japan's conductors stuffing people in trains full of people just so the doors are able to close are over for good. This will likely hurt their profits. Then again, I don't think working from home will take off in Japan as much as it has in the rest of the Western world. Furthermore, a vaccine could cause situations to return to normal in no time. Furthermore, Japan as a whole unfortunately is dealing with a rough economic situation and declining populations. 

The bull in me sees a consistently profitable company that makes great strides in infrastructure technology at a discount of 50%. Japanese train services are head and shoulders above anything in the U.S. or U.K.  and will return to ""normal"" operation (&gt;80% of their normal commuters) by around early 2022. They have multiple irons in their fire regarding income diversification and I find it unlikely that they will go bankrupt any time soon as replacing a semi-nationalized train service will in many cases be more expensive than subsidizing your current one. 

I'm very interested in those that have anything to add. Thank you for reading through this post.

They have multiple irons in their fire regarding income diversification and I find it unlikely that they will go bankrupt any time soon as replacing a semi-nationalized train service will in many cases be more expensive than subsidizing your current one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very interested in those that have anything to add. Thank you for reading through this post. &lt;/p&gt;

I don't really want to push the view that value investing doesn't work anymore; I think that's a red herring. I would love to dig into the idea of ""intangible"" assets being more valuable, yet also that most investors don't understand them.

I believe my entire investment strategy over the past 8 years has been focused on intangible assets that end up generating large amounts of revenue for companies, but only after years of investment. These include data assets, advertising models fuelled by eyeballs, or enablement of marketplaces (e.g., Shopify, Airbnb, SEA Group, etc.). 

The way I tend to approach intangible investments is to answer ""yes"" to all of the following questions:

1. Does the company have an effective product that *some* people (i.e., a small current market) consider ""best in the market""?
2. If the product moves from *some* people buying it to *most* people buying it, will the company 10x its market cap?
3. Are there current players in the space that are 10x bigger than the company? This shows me that it's possible to displace/disrupt current leaders with a new product and strategy and actually capture a massive market. Think: Netflix in its early days (vs. Blockbuster), think Shopify on its IPO day vs. PayPal, Ebay, etc...
4. Do I believe the management team and founders could execute on this?

There are other signals to look for; if I'm right 1/3 of the time and make 10x on those companies, while losing on everyone else, the portfolio can still 3x itself...

U.S. stocks rose on Friday as investors bet again on stocks that would benefit from a potentially effective vaccine and economic recovery next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded higher by 452 points, or 1.6%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.5%, while the techy-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8%. The Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap stocks, jumped more than 2% to an intraday record, and was on pace for its first all-time closing high since August 2018.

Shares of Disney gained 2%. Shares of Carnival Corp., United Airlines and Boeing all rose, capping big gains for the week. At the sector level, energy and industrials rose 3.9% and 1.9%, respectively, to lead the S&amp;P 500 higher. Financials and materials were also up more than 1%.

“This week’s positive vaccine news is a game-changer in our view, as it allows the market to look through the recent surge in COVID-19 cases to the impending end of the pandemic and broader reopening of the economy,” wrote Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan’s head of macro quantitative and derivatives strategy, who was among the first to call the market’s turn in March.

The Dow gained 4% for the week after Pfizer’s news on Monday that the vaccine it is developing with BioNTech was more than 90% effective in a trial.

,investing,"Apologies for the slightly clickbaity title, I wasn't sure how to best formulate the question.

Let me start by saying that I'm not trying to subtly push my point of view onto others in the form of a question. As an outsider that is currently studying the dynamics of the world of investing with the goal of possibly getting in it in the future, I'm genuinely asking what people more experienced than I think about this.

I very often see people discussing the ""true value"" of a company. This is usually done, as far as I can tell, using one of a number of stock valuation methods. What some people refer to as ""fundamental analysis"". I've read my share of articles on [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com) so I think I've got an at least superficial understanding of how this works etc.

However, I find myself wondering *why* this matters at all. On the surface it should be obvious: owning a stock amounts to owning a share of a company, and obviously, you would want to know whether what you are paying reflects the actual value of what you are getting. At the same time, I'd wager that for the majority of people the only real value of owning a stock is the potential gains that can be made when selling it in the future. From this point of view, why does it matter what the ""real value"" of the company behind the stock is? After all, even assuming I know the ""real value"" of company X's share is $10, if I have reason to believe I'll be able to sell that share for $200 in a month, buying it now at $100 is a bargain, regardless of how overpriced it is.

Now, if all investors were to religiously follow stock valuation techniques, relying on it for their investing strategy, it would then make sense to use such value as a baseline, because we should then expect the stock's price to stabilise to such value in the long run. I would submit that, even in this scenario, such ""real value"" of a company would only be relevant for the average investor because other people follow it, not because that's the ""true value"" that the shares you are buying have for you at any given time, but I guess one can disregard this point as being nitpicky.

But here's the thing: the market, at least at a cursory glance, *does not* look rational to me, and it does not look like many stocks' prices actually reflect their ""true value"" as derived from fundamental analysis. It mostly seems to me that prices fluctuate due to news stories. Granted, the real financials of a company *do* affect the price, to some degree, but that's because these financials generate a specific type of news story (profits lower/higher than expectations, buy/sell!). 

So all of this brings me to the question: is there any actual empirical evidence that stocks' prices are directly tied to the real companies' valuations, rather than being directly tied to news stories, and thus only *indirectly* to the real valuations? And if so, by what amount? This is the sort of thing that I think isn't very easy to gauge based only on individuals' personal experience (though I'd also be interested in that), so I'm hoping there is some actual statistical analysis that has been performed to assess this sort of thing.",t2_7iixjnr1,False,,0,False,Do companies' valuations really matter?,[],r/investing,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ju6do6,False,dark,0.54,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605406458.0,text,6,,,text,self.investing,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the slightly clickbaity title, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how to best formulate the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Key takeaways:

* Overall average return of 9.9%, with an equal weighted return of 11%. If you picked a stock from this list at random, you would have a 44% chance of a return greater than 10%
* Highest returning pick: Nio Inc (NIO) at 260% flagged by /u/Carrera_GT, /u/makesalotofmoney, /u/Charlie_Brown364
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen a return of 12.7%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 18.6%
* If you had invested in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 27.4%

See below for takeaways after ~3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you can view a visual version here: &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/sRrYmmy.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall average return of 9.9%, with an equal weighted return of 11%. If you picked a stock from this list at random, you would have a 44% chance of a return greater than 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highest returning pick: Nio Inc (NIO) at 260% flagged by &lt;a href=""/u/Carrera_GT""&gt;/u/Carrera_GT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/makesalotofmoney""&gt;/u/makesalotofmoney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/Charlie_Brown364""&gt;/u/Charlie_Brown364&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen a return of 12.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 18.6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you had invested in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 27.4%&lt;/li&gt;

I watched Tesla go from 300 to 700, to 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000+. Since 300$ everyone was saying it's way overvalued and will crash big time. It kept going. 

How is NIO different? It's a good EV company, backed by the government. 

\- EV marked is growing stronger day by day. In Europe it's already hefty fines for companies not selling enough green cars  
\- In Norway in October more than 60% of new registered cars were electric   
\- Chinese government emphasises a lot on environment last few years  
\- Those Chinese EVs get good reviews and anticipated on European marked  
\- My guess, Biden will limit trade war with China and make way for green power/EVs

With other words, EV is both present and future. NIO, NIU, XPENG, LI can capture Chinese marked and get a good share European/US marked.

Paired together with cheaper production in China and government behind their back (NIO), it seems like a winning receipt?   
XPENG got Baba behind them, not bad neither.  
NIU may capture huge scooter market so popular in all Asian countries

I need to perform a risk adjusted performance evaluation for a university assignment (Portfolio management class) , I have monthly series returns for two portfolios and a benchmark (for 10 years) and the assignment is to calculate the risk adjusted returns such as alpha, sharp ratio and Traynor, and then allocate among the two portfolios.

my question is which risk free rate should I use ? I checked the daily treasury yield curve rates and I was thinking of using the 10- year as it matches the investment horizon as well as it is more liquid than 20-y and 30-y (correct me if I am wrong), the other question is how can I convert this daily returns to monthly in order to calculate the excess return on a monthly basis ?

1. NIO is a startup and currently at a growth phase. Go back to your fundamental and tell me, is NIO currently overprice or severely overpriced
2. Large Total Addressable Market
3. BaaS is attractive especially taxi fleet and robotaxi in the future
4. Chinese government backing (A reason why everyone is investing in it right?)

Cons:

1. Dependent on government backing out from funding. (Come on its possible)
2. I've been to China, there are Tesla car everywhere (Status). Foreign cars are perceived better there.
3. It may be profitable, but not so soon. OR NEVER since they have high capex businesses. There are many firm going bankrupt as a reason for that
4. Their the firstmoover for Baas but it is not an advantage... It is easily copied and follow by the rest of its competitors
5. Priced to perfection
6. It is reliant on third party like JAC motors. How are they going to get their own factory? How much dilution is it going to take to raise money for a factory to keep up with the demand? Can we assume that NIO's factory will be as good as JAC motors?
7. Risk of BaaS station catching fire due to poor quality in the long run. It is going to be a pain to keep having new batteries as it is costly. The only way to preserve quality in the long run is to always use new batteries to swap the vehicles (Which cost tons of money.)

In the event whereby cars starts catching fire due to poor maintenance of batteries, the brand is going to get tarnish.

8) Are quality assurance audited?

I would love a good debate and I wish everyone respect each other opinions on the direction of this company. Let's have a breakdown and a good analysis of this company.
