&lt;p&gt;It was not that bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know its long journey but hoping for best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will update soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not in sales and I have tax-bookkeeping business.&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hi guys, 

I stumbled upon a November-December seasonal side hustle last year, and I was wondering if yall would have some suggestions to help me grow this into something more.

After a long hiatus, I recently got back into woodcarving, which was a childhood pastime. In winter 2019, I made about 700 in sales, mostly selling a single Santa Claus figurine design exclusively on Etsy. 

This year, I decided to start promoting my work in September (I know that’s pretty early), so I created a Facebook page and spent about 100 bucks on Facebook and Etsy marketing from September until today, which is the end of November. In that period, I’ve made about 700 in sales. Based on last year’s numbers, I expect December to bring a decent increase in sales, but here’s where I need help:

1. I sell the figurines for $40/piece. Each one costs me about $7 for materials/packing/shipping. Etsy charges a listing fee of .20 and also 5% of my total sales price. It takes 1.5 hours to make each one, from block of wood to packed up and ready to go. You can see that with these numbers I’m only making about 20 bucks an hour. Depending on how effective/ineffective my ads are, it might be even less than that. 

Although I’m passionate about woodcarving, mass producing the same figurine by hand sucks. Should I consider outsourcing the carvings? 

2. Over the past two holiday seasons, I’ve sold about 35 of these figurines. If I can sell 35, shouldn’t I be able to sell 350 or 3,500? It’s hard to believe that there’s only 35 people in the US who are interested in this product at this price point. I’ve tried to drum up more business with ads, but based on my conversion rate of 1%, they don’t seem to be effective.  

I’d be grateful for any helpful thoughts. 

Here’s my [shop link.](https://etsy.me/3nOxnoK)

I’ve also created a [website](https://www.carvingadream.com) , but understandably, people seem hesitant to trust a random website with their money and probably prefer to use Etsy. This costs me 2% of sales.

I  initially wanted to share the tool in relevant Reddit communities along with a 3-month free offer-code but it seems that this quickly leads to bans or deleted posts.

We're obviously reaching out to our own professional network as one avenue to get testers but we would also like to test with people we have no  connection to have a much larger beta to be sure the tool is ready for users to start paying for it.

,Entrepreneur,"Hi Entrepreneurs.  

As we get ready for Thanksgiving tomorrow in the States, in my work with entrepreneurs I’ve been thinking a lot about the dichotomy between entitlement and gratitude.  I think it’s one of the most powerful, and impactful, decisions an entrepreneur can make.  I wrote a thing about it, and included a practical exercise you can use to make this powerful shift, below: 

#You’re acting entitled

If you’re like most people, you hear that and you immediately get defensive. Maybe even just reading it, right now. “Am not,” you say. And you think you’re telling the truth.

But put aside what you know about what it means to act entitled, the image of a spoiled three-year old perhaps, and really think about it. Think about something you’ve recently complained about, and consider what’s behind that complaint.

If you’re honest, when you look under the sheets of your complaint you’ll find that you feel entitled to the thing you’re complaining about being different than what it is. (You might resist this, but it’s what’s there if you’re honest with yourself.)

Realizing this — that you’re acting the way you might teach your kids not to act — can have the remarkable effect of moving areas of your life that haven’t moved in a long time. Seeing yourself in a new way can change you, if you let it.

Next time you catch yourself complaining about something, lift up the covers and see the entitlement underneath. Give yourself the gift of catching yourself in the act, owning your entitlement even if it’s uncomfortable.

#Entitlement or gratitude. Each moment is a choice.

If gratitude doesn’t feel like a choice, try this exercise

Here’s a quick, two part exercise to illustrate the power of attention, paraphrased from The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership:

Look around the room, identifying everything in a 360-degree radius that is white. Be specific in your inventory, and make sure you find everything.
Go ahead, do this now and I’ll wait.

…

Great.

Now, without looking around the room again, recite all the green things you saw.
…

You find what you look for.

This holiday season, at home, at work, or over Zoom, I invite you to choose to look for things to appreciate. You’ll find them.

#Quote that sums up my thoughts on entitlements vs gratitude

Am I better off making up an alternate reality in my mind and then fighting with reality to make it be my way, or am I better off letting go of what I want and serving the same forces of reality that managed to create the entire perfection of the universe around me?

— Michael Singer

#What I’m grateful for

This Thanksgiving, a vastly incomplete sampling of things that I’m grateful for:

The many people sacrificing to save lives, both COVID related and not, and the many people sacrificing to get us a vaccine
The way the sunlight hits the elm leaves outside my home office window, long after all the other leaves have fallen
The generosity of so many people sharing their love and compassion online (this is my experience of the internet, it may not be yours, in which case see the exercise above)
The worldwide recognition of the importance of community
The right poem at the right time
The forest, walking distance from my house
The amazingly deep relationships I’ve formed since COVID, many over Zoom
The teachers at my oldest son’s school and the teacher at my youngest son’s home-school-pod
My youngest son’s dimples
My oldest son’s boundless energy
My wife’s unquestioning support, for our family and for everyone in her life
My wife’s bravery amidst uncertainty
My wake up call, now over a year old
Receiving a not-so-gentle nudge to make a change
Rediscovering my love for writing, and an audience of leaders I’m so lucky to share my journey with
The many generous people who continue to believe in me and support me
How remarkably serendipitous my life has become, in such a short time
The remarkable men and women I get to work with every day, and their inspiring visions that I get to help bring into the world
The courage to live my one wild, precious life fully, even (especially) if I don’t understand where it’s all headed

,Entrepreneur,"Good morning everyone! I run a software company - we do mid 8 figures in revenue. We are a fully distributed business that has raised mostly debt capital from banks that I've personally guaranteed. This is money accessible to everyone, if you are willing to take sufficient risk and have enough of an operating track record.

When we started, we had zero connections, zero advisory, and did not live in Silicon Valley. It took a total of 8 years to get to where we are, from founding the business to the revenue we do today.

A lot of posts here seem to focus on mindset, but I will share some practical tips on how we got started.

1. It was 2012, but...we built our prototype using Google Docs. We literally wrote out what our business would do, and our value proposition, and saved it in a .pdf
2. We then emailed this .pdf to about 100\~ people a day (manually) with a CTA requesting a call. At the time, we didn't know about how to artfully construct a drip campaign or that emailing a .pdf would trigger the spam filter in a lot of email clients
3. My co-founder and I created a competition - whoever emailed more people by the end of the week, got to be CEO for the next week
4. We did this for months, until enough people agreed to pre-purchase if we built a feature specific to them
5. We then built the things people wanted by hiring a freelance developer
6. We got a bit smarter and started scraping emails, and we emailed them until Angel List's CTO emailed us to ask how we were doing it and asked us to stop

The tools of the game have changed. Not many people spend time reviewing their Angel List inboxes today... (In fact, if there are smart, hungry founders currently growing their business through direct contact, I would like to know how they are reaching folks!)

Happy to answer any and all questions. But that's how we got started. We didn't build a list, produce a nice video, go to a trade show or do a mega-launch at Techcrunch. We literally spent a few hours a day cold emailing people on Angel List for a year. It just takes time, effort, and persistence.

,Entrepreneur,"My business is tiny, and I don't really call myself an entrepreneur (I'm a freelancer). Nevertheless, I thought it might be interesting for other small business owners to see behind the scenes of an established freelance business. I hope it allows for some helpful comparison for other established freelancers, and as inspiration for those starting out that freelancing can provide a reasonable income.

These facts and figures are for **2019**, **prior to COVID**. I’ll post 2020 figures next year, but I’m currently projecting our income and profits for 2020 will be about **20% - 25% lower** as a result of COVID (hence why an emergency budget is so important).

First, a little history. My wife and I have been running a freelance business for the last 14 years. Until 2016, we focused purely on proofreading and copy editing. In 2016, I decided to add freelance writing to what we offered, mainly to diversify revenue streams. Between 2016 and 2019, we managed to up our revenue each year, both due to taking on more work and raising rates. We work exclusively from home.

## Here's an overview of how we did in 2019, starting with the financials. All figures are approximate, rounded, and shown in US dollars.
---
## Total revenue: $146K

* Revenue from proofreading / editing: **$25K**
* Revenue from freelance writing: **$120K**
* Revenue per day from writing: **$500**
* Revenue per day from editing: **$100**
* Total revenue per day: **$600**
---
## Total business expenses (excl taxes): $24K

* Health insurance premiums: **$11K**
* Accounting fees: **$3K** (I had some complex tax matters that I resolved in 2019, fees are for that and EOY filings)
* Computer software and subscriptions etc: **$2K** (SaaS subscriptions, web hosting, etc)
* Bank and credit card charges: **$2K**
* Office costs: **$2K**
* Business donations to charity: **$1K**
* Internet and phone: **$1K**
* Other expenses: **$2K**
---
## Total profits (pre-tax): $122K
---
## Taxes (payroll / self employment, federal, state): c. $33K 
---
## Take Home Pay after Taxes: $89K, $7.5K a month
---
## Living Expenses: $4.5K a month, $55K a year

* We have paid off our mortgage and don’t carry debt.
* We don't have kids, which significantly reduces our expenses.
* We do have “emergency” savings to cover six months of expenses.
---
## Disposable Income: $3.3K a month, 39K a year

* We spend 20% - 30% of this on charitable donations, larger projects, and fun stuff. 
* 70% - 80% of this disposable income is invested over the medium to long term, mainly in retirement accounts. Only 15 years away from retirement and need to build those funds up!

## 2019 Revenue by Major Clients

* Currency exchange business: **$30K**
* Marketing agency for business formation: **$26K**
* Fiverr Pro freelance platform: **$19K**
* Marketing agency for cybersecurity and other clients: **$14K**
* Marketing agency for SaaS: **$12K**
* Supply chain business: **$10K**
* Ecommerce marketplace: **$8K**

## Lessons learned

* **Diversification** \- Diversify among niches and clients as much as is reasonably possible. Don’t rely on one particular client for the majority of your income. Needless to say, the currency exchange business that was my biggest client in 2019 has not used me at all since March 2020, due to COVID. I definitely recommend multiple revenue streams for any freelancer, so you can protect your income.  

* **Independence** \- The only freelance platform that we use is Fiverr Pro which we were invited to join. Fiverr Pro is for professionally priced freelance services, so we can charge as much on there as we do for off-platform work. We haven’t used other freelance platforms like Upwork or Freelancer.  

* **Specialization** \- A narrow focus on specific niches and topics was key to success. On the proofreading / copy editing side, that means non-fiction, medical, and training. On the writing side, that means tech, business, and finance. Specializing means you can often charge more, and helps you get work in the first place.  

* **Confidence** \- If you’re good at what you do, have the confidence to ask for higher rates. My B2B clients are happy to pay my rates for the level of service they get. The ideal position to be in as a freelancer is that you set the rates, not the clients.  

* **Pricing** \- We always price by the project or per word - That works much better for our clients than hourly pricing. Additionally, if you can work fast and maintain quality, that often results in *higher* per hour fees. For example, if you can write a 1,500 word blog post for $200 in 90 minutes, that's an hourly fee of $125. Additionally, I started writing at 10c a word and slowly increased the rate every year, until the c. 35c a word I am on now. That feels like a sweet spot for my current level of expertise, and works for clients.  

* **Automation and efficiency** \- Automation is really important. Less time spent on admin means more time that's chargeable to clients. Key efficiencies for us include IFTTT for scanning job boards and emailing leads, Zapier for transferring information between online services, FreeAgent for accounting, invoicing, expenses, payroll etc, TickTIck for project and task management, and Google Docs for working with clients.  

* **Finances** \- It's really, really important to stay on top of finances, so you can see where you're making money, your key expenses, your financial outlook etc. We also have around six months of household expenses as an ""emergency budget"" which definitely helps our peace-of-mind!  

* **Professionalism** \- This is vital. Presenting yourself as a professional businessperson, with confidence and poise is vital. In other words, it's not just about the work itself, it's about everything around that. Good communications, suggestions to the client, getting contracts in place, always meeting deadlines, following up - It *all* makes a difference.  

* **Clients** \- Do everything you can to find *regular* clients. One of the biggest time sucks for a freelancer is seeking out new leads and applying to them. If you can get clients who use you on a regular basis, that's good for your bank balance, and for reducing time you spend looking for new gigs. For me, the revelation was marketing agencies, who find clients for you!  

* **Finding leads**: Find a lead generation tool that works for you. Much of my lead generation came to applying for very specialist jobs through job boards that I was highly qualified for. In 2020, I completely rebuilt my website and portfolio to concentrate solely on inbound leads, and get between 3 and 5 serious inquiries a month.  

* **Work and life balance** \- Through all of this, it's important to keep a good work and life balance, especially in times of COVID!  

* **Puppies** \- Pets are a *wonder* for freelancers. Perfect for the breaks you take, the love you share, and the need to get out and take them for walks (at least for dogs and wombats.) They're great for mental and physical health.

The Art of War by Sun Tzu
 
 
 
 
Tzu segments his book into 13 chapters that together, discuss being strategic about your decisions and actions.
 
 
 
 
Chapter 1: Laying Plans
 
 
Tzu points out the importance of studying war. He introduces 5 fundamental factors: moral influence, weather, terrain, command, and doctrine that, along with seven other elements he introduces and discusses in other parts of the book, he believes are central to developing a pre-conflict plan for battle.
 
 
He notes that the confidence a people have in their leader is of utmost importance because among other things, it determines their willingness to support the leader’s war campaign.
 
 
Because all warfare is a form of deception, by laying the foundation—pre-engagement planning—and preparing in this manner, a wise commander prepares himself for great success.
 
 
 
 
Chapter 2: Waging War
 
 
The second chapter of the book discusses pre-engagement preparation in the form of ensuring the availability of all the support an army needs before it goes into battle (support, provisions, and equipment).
 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: Offensive Strategy
 
 
Among other things, in the third chapter of the book, Tzu notes one of his most famous strategies: “To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill,” a phrase he uses to reinforce the need for careful planning as the ultimate way to subdue and triumph over all forms of adversities, enemies, and battles.
 
 
 
 
Chapter 4: Disposition
 
 
The fourth chapter of Sun Tzu’s Art of War clarifies the distinctions between defense and offense 
 
 
The main purpose of this chapter is to illustrate the differences between defensive and offensive strategies/tactics. He notes, “The experts in defense conceal themselves ... those skilled in attack move as from above. ... Thus they are capable of ... protecting themselves and ... gaining ... victory.""
 
 
 
 
Chapter 5: Energy 
 
 
In the fifth chapter, Tzu turns his attention to the organization of troops. He notes the importance of building and organizing troops into skillful units that can operate as a single, powerful force.
 
 
 
 
Chapter 6: Weaknesses and Strengths
 
 
Building on the lessons from the last three chapters, Tzu notes that the successful general is one who has the ability to trick an opponent into engaging.
 
 
 
 
Chapter 7: Maneuver 
 
 
As part of the opening for this chapter, Sun Tzu piques, “Nothing is more difficult than the art of maneuver,"" which he expands by noting that triumph in battle often boils down to deception, a general’s ability to make a very organized and focused strategy or course appear complicated and aimless.  
 
 
 
 
Chapter 8: Variation in Tactics
 
 
In the eight chapter of the book, Tzu lays the foundation for the nine variables he discusses in the eleventh chapter.
 
 
Low laying ground: “no wise general should ask his troops to encamp here.”
Desolate: “an army should move through as quickly as possible.”
Where roads intersect: “a wise general joins his allies.” 
Enclosed grounds: “a wise general employs stratagem and resourcefulness to find a way out of the situation.”
Desperate situation: “the only option is to fight.” 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 9: The Army on the March
 
 
For the most part, chapter 9 of the Art of War addresses the need for discipline as an army marches towards the battlefield and more importantly, the arrangement employed 
 
 
This chapter is also an illustration of the importance of keen observation. 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 10: Terrain
 
 
In chapter 10, Tzu returns to the topic of terrain and discusses six types of terrains: 
 
 
On accessible ground, the general with the high ground and well-organized supplies has the battle advantage. 
To entangled terrain, retreat or escape is harder and therefore, a wise general should attack only after careful forethought and if the enemy is unprepared. 
On deadlock terrain, he notes, “no side has an advantage” and a wise general draws out the enemy (by retreating) and avoiding falling for the enemy’s tricks. 
For enclosed terrain, the army that gets there first has the advantage because it can block it and lay in wait for the enemy. 
To precipitous grounds, the general who arrives first should take up high ground. When the enemy has high ground, a wise general should retreat as a tactic to lure out the enemy. 
On distant terrain where the armies are of equal strength, none has the advantage. 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 11: The Nine Situations
 
 
Chapter 11 details nine different types of battlegrounds and the tactics that work best for each type of ground. 
 
 
In dispersive ground where the battlefield is within the commander’s territory, in frontier ground where advance into enemy territory is shallow, and in “key” grounds where the ground is neutral or advantageous to both armies, Tzu notes that such grounds are not conducive to victory.
On expanded and level grounds where fortifications are possible, engagement is necessary but only if a General can keep his formations together and united. 
On focal ground, a ground surrounded by other states, a wise General should seek alliances and carefully plan his approach for the risk is higher since allies are not 100% dependable. 
On “serious” grounds where the troops make deep inroad into enemy territory, a wise General moves on quickly.
On “encircled” where in addition to jagged terrain, the enemy attacks, a commander should resort to stratagem because fighting out is the best possible course of action. 
 
 
Chapter 12: The Attack by Fire
 
 
Chapter 12 is one of the shortest in the book. In this chapter, Tzu describes the various ways to attack by fire. He notes that because of the equipment involved, an attack by fire requires a great degree of pre-planning. 
 
 
Chapter 13: The Use of Spies
 
 
The last chapter is about the cost of war and the need to employ spies to have a strategic advantage over the enemy. The first two kinds of spies, native (native to the enemy’s country) and inside (agents already residing inside the enemy’s army structure), he notes, are best because they have “insider information”.
 
 
On “doubled” agents, susceptible spies the enemy has sent into an opposing army, he notes that through bribery, they can covey falsehoods—to which he notes act as a form of deception. However, because of their “doubled” nature and affinity to bribes, Tzu reinforces the need to handle such spies with great caution. 
 
 
“Expendable” agents are exactly that: expendable. Their purpose is to feed the enemy with falsified information. “Living agents” are spies that gather information and deliver it directly to the general. The information gathered by living spies is highly influential and advantageous.  
 
 
 
 
I hope that was useful, have a great day!

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 11 details nine different types of battlegrounds and the tactics that work best for each type of ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dispersive ground where the battlefield is within the commander’s territory, in frontier ground where advance into enemy territory is shallow, and in “key” grounds where the ground is neutral or advantageous to both armies, Tzu notes that such grounds are not conducive to victory.
On expanded and level grounds where fortifications are possible, engagement is necessary but only if a General can keep his formations together and united. 
On focal ground, a ground surrounded by other states, a wise General should seek alliances and carefully plan his approach for the risk is higher since allies are not 100% dependable. 
On “serious” grounds where the troops make deep inroad into enemy territory, a wise General moves on quickly.
On “encircled” where in addition to jagged terrain, the enemy attacks, a commander should resort to stratagem because fighting out is the best possible course of action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 12: The Attack by Fire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 12 is one of the shortest in the book. In this chapter, Tzu describes the various ways to attack by fire. He notes that because of the equipment involved, an attack by fire requires a great degree of pre-planning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 13: The Use of Spies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last chapter is about the cost of war and the need to employ spies to have a strategic advantage over the enemy. The first two kinds of spies, native (native to the enemy’s country) and inside (agents already residing inside the enemy’s army structure), he notes, are best because they have “insider information”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On “doubled” agents, susceptible spies the enemy has sent into an opposing army, he notes that through bribery, they can covey falsehoods—to which he notes act as a form of deception. However, because of their “doubled” nature and affinity to bribes, Tzu reinforces the need to handle such spies with great caution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Expendable” agents are exactly that: expendable. Their purpose is to feed the enemy with falsified information. “Living agents” are spies that gather information and deliver it directly to the general. The information gathered by living spies is highly influential and advantageous.  &lt;/p&gt;

I have a really funny gag/cool gift I made that is very inexpensive, it's a type of costume jewelry item.

I have tons of this product in my house and if more successful I can order more from my specific factory.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone! I post regularly about business ideas and opportunities. I made a previous post like this and you all seemed to like it. I’m back with another 3 ideas! You can check out more ideas like this [here](http://brainstorms.io/).

To preface, I personally think these are 3 solid (albeit not deeply researched) ideas that I think you could turn into pretty sweet businesses or side projects. Here’s what I’ve been thinking about -  


* **Software to Analyze Web Session Recordings:** Whether you know it or not, millions of companies are recording your activity while on their website using tools like Hotjar, Lucky Orange, and many more. While it may seem creepy, this data is incredibly valuable to these companies. In fact, this information is so valuable that these companies will spend hours watching footage to find places to make changes so they can create the best experience for their customers. Rather than the company spending hours watching recordings to glean insights, there should be software that analyzes these videos and gives recommendations on how to optimize the website.
* **Drones for Roof Inspections** \- Drones have been trendy for a while now, but I’m still not seeing many practical uses being implemented. I recently had to get my roof inspected and the process was antiquated, to say the least. There were a few forms I had to fill out, I had to be present when the person showed up, and it took the guy like an hour to get all of the information on my roof to create an estimate. One practical use of drones could be for roof inspections. As a consumer, I don’t care how they gather the information on my house so long as it’s easy for me. Whereas for the company, I can’t imagine it’s economical to have a guy drive around to each house and spend an hour inspecting it for damage. A few ideas here -

1. Be the drone company that roofing companies outsource their roof inspections too.
2. Run ads for free quick roofing inspections and sell leads to roofing companies.
3. If legally possible (which it may not be), just fly drones around and look for damaged roofs - sell those leads.

* **AliExpress Price Chrome Extension** \- It’s surprising to me how few people know about AliExpress/Alibaba given that the majority of the products we buy as consumers are sourced from there. In a lot of cases, you’ll pay the same exact product from Amazon for 2-3x what you could get it for on AliExpress. I like the idea of a Chrome extension that compares and shows prices between similar products being sold on Amazon and AliExpress. For example, when you’re on an Amazon listing, the extension will automatically tell you what that same product costs on AliExpress. You could monetize the extension by offering an option to purchase the product from AliExpress and take a cut of that transaction. The key here is you’d need to find customers who are willing to accept longer shipping times in exchange for cheaper prices.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys, there are a few acquisition channels most of you are targeting (Facebook, SEO, Twitter, content marketing,

If you're familiar with the [law of shitty clickthroughts](https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/), you'll know that over time, the effectiveness of those channels/strategies goes down (as they become more saturated). As a founder, some of those strategies can be **out of reach** when you start (too expensive, too much competition, etc.), because you're too late to the game.

The solution? **Be early to the game**. How?

Platforms like Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Google release new business features **all the time**.  When they do that, they are **actively looking to promote them** by integrating them into their existing products/giving preference to creators who use them, etc.

That's **great news for you**. This is the first (and hopefully not the last, please upvote this post if you think I should continue doing this) issue of a weekly newsletter where I plan to explore some of these news/opportunities and how you can make use of these new acquisition (sub)channels/strategies. So here are the latest acquisition channel opportunities that happened over the past week:

## [YouTube Launches Audio Ads (Opportunity: Get Lower CPCs)](https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/youtube-music-audio-ads/)

&amp;#x200B;

**What this means for you:** Every time a major platform launches a new type of ads, there's an opportunity to get exposure for much cheaper as compared to their ""traditional"" ad formats (for YouTube, it's in-video streams). This is one such opportunity.

Do you have a domain name that's easy to pronounce? You can try and create an audio ad &amp; see how many people you drive to it.

## [Twitter Launches Their Version of ""Instagram Stories"" (Opportunity: Get Better Exposure to Followers)](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/11/17/21570348/twitter-fleets-audio-spaces-new-feature-clubhouse-instagram-stories)

It's called ""Fleets"" and I'm already seeing it on my Twitter mobile app

**What this means for you:** People notice new things. Millions of users are going to notice their Twitter feed looks different &amp; will pay more attention to it. This is an opportunity for you to **reach more of your Twitter followers**. Also, the media is going to keep covering this. If you can think of a viral format of a Twitter story / get people to share it / get media to cover it, that's extra free exposure.

## [Instagram May Turn into a Mini Search Engine (Opportunity: Use this early to appear first)](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/expanding-guides-on-instagram)

&amp;#x200B;

Instagram recently made ""guides"" available for everyone. ""Guides"" are basically articles inside Instagram. There are speculations that they'll soon change their search bar, so you can actually find those guides...turning Instagram into a mini search engine.

**What this means for you:** If you thought that you can't post informational content on Instagram, you were right...until now. You can try this ""guides"" feature by creating a sample guide and share it on your story (yes you can do that). If things go the way they do, Instagram will also soon enable people to advertise their ""guides"", which will be pretty interesting.

## [Content Marketing: Get Viral by Making Fun of Twitter's ""Disputed"" Footers (Opportunity: Interesting angle to create engaging Tweets)](https://adage.com/article/digital/brands-have-fun-claim-disputed-twitter-meme/2295311)

Some brands are already starting to [do this](https://twitter.com/BurgerKing/status/1328764442230853636). No need for ""what it means for you"" for this one :D

&amp;#x200B;

## [Monetization Opportunity: Make $ on Facebook When People Share Your Videos](https://www.facebook.com/formedia/blog/new-monetization-opportunities-for-creators-on-facebook)

[Facebook Rights Manager](https://rightsmanager.fb.com/) is a tool where, if someone posts your images/videos, you'll get notified of it &amp; you can decide what to do (block it, add an attribution to the picture/video and so on).

Facebook has recently announced they'll offer creators an ability to also ""collect ad earnings"" from things like in-stream ads if someone posts a video that was originally yours.

**What this means for you:** If you have a Facebook page [with 10k+ followers](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1884527914934148?id=1200580480150259) &amp; have generated at least 30k 1-minute video views in the past 60 days, you may want to enroll into this program. Having the power to see who re-posts your stuff can open a lot of opportunities (you can potentially get in touch for partnerships/ask for a small mention in exchange, and so on).

\-----

Wait, I just got a reply that mentions 'love' and 'cold email' in the same sentence (I just can't stop being surprised by how far this got):

**""I loved your cold email**, congratulations on one of the best cold emails I have seen in a while. Well crafted.""

But the reality is, cold emailing when done right can truly help people. When you reach out to people that can really benefit from your product/service, you are helping people! (yes, cold emailing has this power, but you need to do it right). The problem is to know who are these people... For that, there is no better thing than a scientific approach to sales.

Cold emailing is a process and the first step **lead generation.** The problem is that this is often an overlooked part of the process. However, a good lead generation process is essential to:

1- Make sure you're contacting people that will be happy to read your email (this is what we want right?)

2- Get enough data points about your leads so you can add extra personalization (it's never enough ;) )

\----

To help me with a great lead generation process I've come to learn a few things about LinkedIn and Sales Navigator. This is a tool that many people usually have but don't fully utilize its potential. So, to pass on these learnings to my team, [I wrote a quick lead generation guide](http://blog.amplemarket.com/how-to-find-purchase-intent-linkedin/) for Sales Navigator. You're free to check the link, but here are some of the most important points I stress there:

\- Department headcount growth lets you filter for growing teams that have available money to spend

\- Companies that are hiring have even more money available to spend right now

\- Managers that changed jobs recently and are working in growing teams are most likely looking for tools to help them accommodate that growth (reach out!)

\- Managers that recently changed jobs, are working with growing teams and are usually active on LinkedIn have outstanding engagement rates to your emails and Linkedin messages! (for these ones you may try a LinkedIn VOICE message (check it here) - trust me, they will be surprised!)

\- etc

Founding a company during a pandemic required being able to pivot quickly to the new reality. In March, I immediately started volunteering time towards COVID-19 research through the Kaggle CORD-19 challenge. The body of NLP applications NeuML had were directly applicable to that challenge. I worked 70+ hours a week on this effort for much of the spring and feel the work helped the medical community early on in the pandemic. 

These efforts broadened the scope of NeuML towards more generalized NLP and led down the path of building a number of related open-source applications. Opportunities are now available that would have not been available, presenting a clearer path towards a successful business model.

Sharing this story to hopefully help others on their own entrepreneurial journey.

I worked 70+ hours a week on this effort for much of the spring and feel the work helped the medical community early on in the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts broadened the scope of NeuML towards more generalized NLP and led down the path of building a number of related open-source applications. Opportunities are now available that would have not been available, presenting a clearer path towards a successful business model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing this story to hopefully help others on their own entrepreneurial journey. &lt;/p&gt;

If you want to start an online business but don't have a lot of money, selling on Amazon is a great option. With this method, you can set up your own business without spending a lot of money. Let's get started!

FBA stands for Fulfillment by Amazon. It's a way to sell items online without having to deal with shipping.

To set up an FBA business, you need to buy products that you can resell on Amazon. You then send the products to Amazon's warehouse and they ship them out when someone buys them!

To start your own FBA business, you need to have a little startup capital. You'll need about $1,000 for the first month of inventory (that's about 10-50 items). Then you'll also need some money for packaging and shipping supplies ($100-$300).

Then you'll need a computer with internet access and a phone or tablet with internet access so that you can take pictures of your items and list them on Amazon. The rest is just hard work! You'll be able to sell your items on Amazon at around 50% off of retail price!

## Decide what you want to sell

The first thing you need to do is decide what you want to sell. You can sell anything on Amazon, but it's a good idea to choose something that's in high demand and has a low price point.

If you're not sure what to sell, try searching for items on Amazon and seeing which ones have the highest sales volume. Then look at the reviews for those items and see if there are any common complaints or problems with them. If there are, you might be able to solve those problems by creating your own product that doesn't have those issues.

## Choose a product to sell

The first step in setting up your own FBA business is to choose a product to sell. You can sell anything on Amazon, but some products are better than others.

The best products are ones that have high demand and low competition. If you're just starting out, you want to find a product that's easy to get and doesn't require a lot of work on your part.

You can use the Amazon sales rank as a guide for this step. The lower the sales rank, the more popular the item is -- and the less competition you'll have when selling it yourself.

## Find a supplier

Finding a supplier is the first step in setting up your own FBA business. You need to find someone who will sell you products at wholesale prices and ship them directly to Amazon for you.

There are lots of ways to find suppliers, but here are some good places to start:

Craigslist - check the ""for sale"" section on Craigslist in your area.

Etsy - check out Etsy's wholesale page for more information about selling wholesale on Etsy.

## Create your Amazon seller account

The first step is to create an Amazon seller account. To do this, go to https://sellercentral.amazon.com/ and click ""Sign Up Now"" in the top right corner of the screen.

You'll need to enter your name, email address, password, and a few other details before you can move on. Once you've done that, you'll be taken to a page with some information about selling on Amazon. Read through it carefully and make sure you understand everything before continuing!

## List your products on Amazon

First, you need to find products to sell. You can do this by looking at the top sellers on Amazon and seeing what they're selling. You can also look at other websites that review products and see what they recommend.

Once you've found some products, search for them on Amazon and see how much they cost. If the price is too high, you might be able to find a supplier who will sell it to you for less money.

## Optimize your listings for better sales

The first step to optimizing your listings is to make sure you have a good product. If you're selling something that's cheap and low quality, people won't want to buy it.

The next step is to take good pictures of your product. You can use a digital camera or a smartphone for this, but make sure the pictures are clear and show the product from different angles.

The last step is pricing. You want to price your products so that they're competitive with other sellers' prices but not too high that people won't buy them.

## Promote your products on social media and other platforms

The best way to promote your products is to use social media. You can also try using other platforms like blogs, forums, and review sites.

The first thing you need to do is create a Facebook page for your business. Then you can start posting about your products on that page. Make sure to post regularly so people don't forget about you!

You can also try promoting your products on other platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Tumblr. Just make sure not to spam people or they'll unfollow you!

## Monitor the performance of your products and business

When you're selling on Amazon, it's important to monitor your business. You can do this by checking your seller central dashboard regularly.

The dashboard will show you how well your products are selling, how much money you've made from them, and other useful information. It's a great way to see how well your business is doing and make adjustments as necessary.",t2_526yq0h6,False,,0,False,A Quick Guide - How to make $500 per month in passive income selling other people's products on Amazon,[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k0jq6i,False,dark,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606301732.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to start an online business but don&amp;#39;t have a lot of money, selling on Amazon is a great option.

,Entrepreneur,"This blog post is based on a conversation we had with Reza Sabahi. Reza Sabahi is the managing director at Wells Fargo Capital finance, which is one of the specialized lending lines of businesses at Wells Fargo. It is a business to business commercial loan portfolio. Reza’s department exclusively provides finance to technology companies (primarily software companies in North America and Western Europe). In his role Reza oversees a team that manages direct credit exposure to a variety of different technology companies. 

### Reza on what leveraged Buyout (LBO) is:

According to Reza an LBO refers to making an acquisition of an entity or entities using a lot of debt. He advises startup founders that an LBO is an alternative option for a liquidity event. 

### Difference between loan- and revenue based financing:

Reza notes that it is difficult for a startup to obtain credit from a bank. It is easier now because technology has become such a big part of our lives that banks are more willing to provide loans to startups or early stage technology companies. Additionally, Reza pontificates that typically non bank lenders offer revenue based financing. Revenue based financing works by lenders providing debt structured around the revenues of the startup which  means that a lender will give a company a percentage of their revenues whether it is one or two times mrr. Unlike pure revenue based financing where it is a revolving line of credit, so that companies only have access to whatever their revenue formula is, banks like Wells Fargo are willing to provide term financing. Meaning that day one startups may have access to a much larger source of capital, without the same burdensome requirements to pay down and borrow. Obviously that is case by case and depends on the performance of the business. 

### What other factors play a role in deciding if a traditional bank will give financing to a startup:

Reza shares that the fundamentals for extending credit to any company are going to be the same: banks want to understand the business, the billing practices, services the business provides, and the management of it. However, technology companies are unique and some of the things they look for when it comes to tech companies are: the quality of the revenue, the churn of the business, gross profit, cash flow conversion, the cost structure, enterprise value, total addressable market (TAM), and what the source of funds are going to be used for. 

### The requirements for startups to get capital from a bank:

Reza says that the first thing an entrepreneur needs to be armed with is a very strong understanding of their own business. He also states that founders will also need a very detailed and achievable forecast as well as an ability to explain that forecast to someone who might not be familiar with the industry. For most bank loans you will also need 2-3 years of revenue history. Although, banks require revenue that does not necessarily mean that they need a company to show profit, in order to extend credit. Another thing that you don’t necessarily need to get credit from a bank is near-term cash flow. Of course you need to be able to articulate why your company is not generating cash flow and explain at what point you might be. 

In summary, what you need in order to secure financing from a bank is to know your business, have revenues, have a plan, and have conviction for whatever your plan is. 

### Why startups don’t need cash flow in order to secure a loan from a bank :

Most technology startups do not need to generate near-term free cash flow in order to get financing from a bank because sometimes there is  much demand for the product or service of a company  that it is more accretive from a valuation perspective to invest cash flow from operations into sales and marketing and product development. However, startups do have to have a plan to generate cash flow at some point in the future. 

### What amount revenue is required to obtain credit from a bank:

According to Reza most banks lenders will want to see a technology company with at least 2 million in annualized recurring revenue. Now that does not necessarily mean that you need 2 million of trailing 12 month revenue. If you are a high growth startup and if your mrr is growing aggressively, there are lenders that would look at your most current quarter or month and annualize that figure.  Once a technology company gets to 7-10 million in recurring revenue there are a lot of good options for financing. 

### Pros and Cons of receiving financing from a bank:

Reza cautions that most banks when dealing with the companies that have low revenue are going to require a personal guarantee from the founder which means that if the company is unable to pay its obligations and repay the loan, the bank will in most cases try and go after the founder of the company, including going after their personal assets. However, that is generally not going to be a likely outcome because if the lender is doing their diligence they should not find themselves in that situation. Moreover, bank loans and financing comes with rules and restrictions that may not come with equity investments. For example, even if you get a small loan you're going to have to provide the bank some reporting. It is not uncommon to be required to provide monthly reporting, quarterly reporting, or annual reporting. Additionally, most bank loans come with loan covenants. The term covenant is just a fancy legal way that means you are agreeing to do or not do certain things. Some common loan covenants require you to generate a certain amount of revenue or that your leverage does not get too high. In terms of pros from receiving financing from a bank is that you generally don’t have to give up equity. 

### Call to action:

Reza’s call to action is to urge entrepreneurs to have a solid understanding of the finances of their business. Know it so well that you can articulate it easily and effortlessly.

He also advises startup founders that going the equity route is not the only option for raising money.",t2_7adsaolj,False,,0,False,Blog Post: How startups can work with banks,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Startup Help'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_k0bj24,False,dark,0.33,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Startup Help,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606273871.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog post is based on a conversation we had with Reza Sabahi.

,Entrepreneur,"In this short  blog post we will summarize the tips Sarah Leners, Venture Capital Senior Associate at Bull City Venture Partners, shared in regards to getting your first call with an investor.  


### Networking advice for founders: 

1. Perform a basic web search before hand;
2. Research companies in a similar space in order to find out who were their early stage investors (this fact will mean that they are already familiar with your space and they also might be able to connect you with new customers or mentors);
3. If you and a VC do not fit or mesh well, do not be afraid to ask if they could recommend you to another venture capitalists/investor. The VC community is quite small and because of that mostly everyone knows and keeps in touch with one another. 
4. Reach out to a local ecosystem or investor community (via LinkedIn or email). To find Email addresses of people from LinkedIn we recommend using SalesQL. 

In regards to finding your first investor Sarah states that the strategy described above is the right one. She also recommends using special databases to conduct research, for example you can use Foundersuite, CrunchBase or PitchBook. 

When you find an investor who might be interested in your idea, you have to do some homework before contacting them. It means you need to find out whether an investor has participated in some podcast and/or written an article you could be able to refer to in your message. 

It is also a good idea to check LinkedIn and other social media in order to find some possible common connections, which will possibly become «ice breakers». 

### First call advice: 

1. Be prepared with your pitch deck and demo if it is applicable to your business; 
2. Remember that investors are human too, so that is completely in order if you do not have an answer to something. 
3. You should be well prepared to present your idea and show your vision of the market so it is better to do some team practise before your first call. Moreover, it is also wise to have all of your team participate.
4. Even if it is not the full team or if you are working solo it is important to have a second person taking notes of what is happening in order to improve your way of leading the call and answering the questions in future. ",t2_7adsaolj,False,,0,False,Blog Post: How to land your first call with an investor,[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k0bhxw,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606273781.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this short  blog post we will summarize the tips Sarah Leners, Venture Capital Senior Associate at Bull City Venture Partners, shared in regards to getting your first call with an investor.  &lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"I sat down with Scott in a Business Breakthrough session. 

Here’s his specs:

* **22 Years old**
* **Owns a Painting Business in Wisconsin** 
* **Has 3 Full time employees, has 1 sub team he trusts to do work when there’s overflow**
* **Has been in business for 4 years**
* **Averages around 10-15k per month**

He came to me wanting a [Business Breakthrough Session](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/contractor-secrets/id1477208973#episodeGuid=a886a00f-6df9-462a-a611-27c6cbc477f6) because of his inability to make it through the winter. When he jumped on our call, he was in his living room, hanging out…**waiting for the phone to ring.** 

Immediately, there were definitely some things I liked about Scott and the way he did business. Him being a young contractor, he’s well equipped with technology and has a good understanding of sales and marketing when it comes to knowing his role in his company. He’s not tied to the “brush” as we call it in the painting business…which is great, because he can focus on working ON his business instead of IN his business. 

He also made his team members employees. This is hard for a lot of painting contractors, and contractors in general in the northern states, for the very reason we are discussing today. So, he earned my respect immediately. 

However, with 4 years in, he shouldn’t be so scarce when it comes to work around this time..so I dug a little deeper as to why he was struggling, and why he was completely out of control. 

My first question was, ***what’s your marketing strategy?*** How are you generating business?

*Scott's answer: “Sherwin Williams has been great throughout this year, they send me a good amount of clients…So I relied on them a lot”* 

*My assessment:* This is a major problem. His entire marketing strategy is dependent on something he cannot control, which has led him to this major bottleneck in his business. He’s unable to control whether or not the phone rings because he is reliant on word of mouth...which (especially during Covid) is a **completely unreliable lead source.** 

So, knowing that his marketing strategy was the major issue here...

I then asked him the name of his town, and as he was telling me, I was plugging it into google, followed by the word “painters”. 

The results? **His company was no where to be found.** 

*“Scott, you have to understand, that in house painting, people only search for you when they need you. The reason your phone is not ringing is because when they need you, they can’t find you.”* 

**Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty**

Having a strong Google presence is a must. **I recommended he hire a google specialist to help him get ranked for his city, and start working on getting as many Google Reviews as possible.** We looked at his closest competitor in his area, and they only had 21 Google Reviews! He could immediately place himself as the ""Top Rated Company"" with just 22 Reviews! Too easy! 

Although all of this is great, the major problem is what’s going on at this moment. No work, with winter coming up. 

It’s not entirely too late to generate business, but I told him one of the best things he can do is hire a lead generation company to send him interior leads. He’s got to have some sort of lead flow tailored to the specific job type he needs at this current time. 

Another way he can generate interest is to have a CRM or book of business that he can re-market to. If he categorizes jobs as ""exterior"" during the summer, he can re-market to those individuals offering ""Interior"" services. 

Going forward, if he implements these strategies next year he will set himself up for a prosperous winter next year. 

But, I didn't want to leave him empty handed for this year...so, I asked if he had any open bids right now waiting for people say ""Yes or No"" 

**The Fortune is in The Follow Up:** 

Scott [exclaimed to me](https://instagram.com/contractorcoach) that he is not comfortable following up, because it makes him feel like he is coming across as ""needy"". He's also concerned that people aren't reaching back out to him because he feels as though they clearly don't want the job. ""If they wanted us to do the work, they'd probably call us""

This couldn't be further from the truth. 

To address his first concern as coming across as needy, there's two ways to come across when you're following up: 

Excited to do the work, or needy. 

The difference between the two? How much money you have saved. 

If you have no money, you're not so much needy, you're ***desperate.*** 

Desperation can be felt through the phone. It will repel the client, and they will most likely feel apprehensive to hire you. 

  
However, when money isn't the issue, and it's more so out of wanting to keep your team busy, and also doing what's in the best interest of the customer by being excited to help them achieve their home improvement goals, ***coming across excited exudes enthusiasm.***

&lt;p&gt;Here’s his specs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22 Years old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owns a Painting Business in Wisconsin&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has 3 Full time employees, has 1 sub team he trusts to do work when there’s overflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has been in business for 4 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Averages around 10-15k per month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He came to me wanting a &lt;a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/contractor-secrets/id1477208973#episodeGuid=a886a00f-6df9-462a-a611-27c6cbc477f6""&gt;Business Breakthrough Session&lt;/a&gt; because of his inability to make it through the winter. When he jumped on our call, he was in his living room, hanging out…&lt;strong&gt;waiting for the phone to ring.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, there were definitely some things I liked about Scott and the way he did business. Him being a young contractor, he’s well equipped with technology and has a good understanding of sales and marketing when it comes to knowing his role in his company. He’s not tied to the “brush” as we call it in the painting business…which is great, because he can focus on working ON his business instead of IN his business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also made his team members employees. This is hard for a lot of painting contractors, and contractors in general in the northern states, for the very reason we are discussing today. So, he earned my respect immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with 4 years in, he shouldn’t be so scarce when it comes to work around this time..so I dug a little deeper as to why he was struggling, and why he was completely out of control. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first question was, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what’s your marketing strategy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; How are you generating business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scott&amp;#39;s answer: “Sherwin Williams has been great throughout this year, they send me a good amount of clients…So I relied on them a lot”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My assessment:&lt;/em&gt; This is a major problem. His entire marketing strategy is dependent on something he cannot control, which has led him to this major bottleneck in his business. He’s unable to control whether or not the phone rings because he is reliant on word of mouth...which (especially during Covid) is a &lt;strong&gt;completely unreliable lead source.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, knowing that his marketing strategy was the major issue here...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then asked him the name of his town, and as he was telling me, I was plugging it into google, followed by the word “painters”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results? &lt;strong&gt;His company was no where to be found.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Scott, you have to understand, that in house painting, people only search for you when they need you. The reason your phone is not ringing is because when they need you, they can’t find you.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dig Your Well Before You&amp;#39;re Thirsty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a strong Google presence is a must. &lt;strong&gt;I recommended he hire a google specialist to help him get ranked for his city, and start working on getting as many Google Reviews as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; We looked at his closest competitor in his area, and they only had 21 Google Reviews! He could immediately place himself as the &amp;quot;Top Rated Company&amp;quot; with just 22 Reviews! Too easy! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although all of this is great, the major problem is what’s going on at this moment. No work, with winter coming up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely too late to generate business, but I told him one of the best things he can do is hire a lead generation company to send him interior leads. He’s got to have some sort of lead flow tailored to the specific job type he needs at this current time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way he can generate interest is to have a CRM or book of business that he can re-market to. If he categorizes jobs as &amp;quot;exterior&amp;quot; during the summer, he can re-market to those individuals offering &amp;quot;Interior&amp;quot; services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, if he implements these strategies next year he will set himself up for a prosperous winter next year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I didn&amp;#39;t want to leave him empty handed for this year...so, I asked if he had any open bids right now waiting for people say &amp;quot;Yes or No&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fortune is in The Follow Up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott &lt;a href=""https://instagram.com/contractorcoach""&gt;exclaimed to me&lt;/a&gt; that he is not comfortable following up, because it makes him feel like he is coming across as &amp;quot;needy&amp;quot;. He&amp;#39;s also concerned that people aren&amp;#39;t reaching back out to him because he feels as though they clearly don&amp;#39;t want the job. &amp;quot;If they wanted us to do the work, they&amp;#39;d probably call us&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This couldn&amp;#39;t be further from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address his first concern as coming across as needy, there&amp;#39;s two ways to come across when you&amp;#39;re following up: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excited to do the work, or needy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two? How much money you have saved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no money, you&amp;#39;re not so much needy, you&amp;#39;re &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;desperate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desperation can be felt through the phone. It will repel the client, and they will most likely feel apprehensive to hire you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when money isn&amp;#39;t the issue, and it&amp;#39;s more so out of wanting to keep your team busy, and also doing what&amp;#39;s in the best interest of the customer by being excited to help them achieve their home improvement goals, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;coming across excited exudes enthusiasm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm is what pushes the needle. Enthusiasm is what gets people to say...&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you know what, this guy might be a little more expensive, but his enthusiasm tells me that he&amp;#39;s going to do a remarkable job&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;...compared to the other company that I can&amp;#39;t even get a hold of...he&amp;#39;s worth paying more&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I put it like that, Scott felt at ease and actually was eager to pick up the phone and &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFOvUJjtOvo""&gt;start dialin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;!&amp;quot; - Wolf of Wallstreet Reference. &lt;/p&gt;

Imagine creating a giant facility, almost the size of a shopping mall that provided all needs to someone at there whim. Food, entertainment, housing, shopping but every so often completely change what food is there, entertainment, housing and shopping there is.

,Entrepreneur,"### Good Advice

Here’s some good advice that I never heard:

1. Start a business. It’s easy! 
2. Start a FOOD business, they’re the easiest! 
3. Choose a food with a hard to pronounce name, that most people don’t know about. 
4. Do it in a pandemic. 

### What We’re Doing - Kolaches

Well, Tom and I are starting a [kolache](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/11/28/502088150/the-czech-pastry-that-took-texas-by-storm-and-keeps-gaining-strength) business, in Chicago.

[image](https://i.imgur.com/RNWz3Y9.png)

[image](https://i.imgur.com/6mfyLPO.png)

Odds are, you don’t even know what that word is, and aren’t completely confident about how to pronounce it (all the hallmarks of a fantastic good idea).

Here’s the big picture: we are starting a baked goods business. The primary product is a sweet bun, filled with savory fillings.

The best way to imagine it is what you would get if you crossed a **sweet Hawaiian dinner roll with the filling of a breakfast taco**.

They’re delicious. They’re very common in Texas (where I grew up), but they’re largely unknown outside of Texas.

### Why It’s A Risky Idea

Well, the reasons above:

1. Food is hard 
2. Unknown or confusing product in our geography 
3. Pandemic 

### Why We’re Doing It Anyways

_a. k. a. “What We’re Trying That We Think is Unique”_

_a. k. a. “Our Theory For Succeeding Despite The Challenges”_

**Cross Pollination**

I believe there is a lot of “common knowledge” that accrues in some industries or fields that simply doesn’t transfer (or transfers very slowly) to other fields where it could be valuable.

Applying the widely known techniques from one field to your own can give you an unfair advantage over your competitors.

Examples:

- Obama’s campaign was the first to widely use A/B testing in their website and “modern” email marketing tactics to presidential elections, despite the fact that these techniques were widely used by tech startups. 
- Trump’s (first) campaign activated Twitter and Facebook ad targeting in a way that no other candidates had before. This playbook was being run by Silicon Valley for a decade beforehand. 
- [Billy Beane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane) (Moneyball) applied statistics to baseball to create amazing teams at a fraction of the price in ways that defied the standard practices of the time. 
- The Black-Scholes options pricing model was a difficult and “unsolved” problem in finance until a chance encounter with a physicist, who looked at it and immediately recognized it as a solved problem in physics (gas diffusion). 

All of these seem obvious in hindsight, but at the time gave someone an edge over their peers/competitors by applying a common practice in one field to another.

Our thesis is basically: “**Do the things that startups do, but apply it to food.**”

**First Principles Thinking**

Don’t be afraid to reconsider things from the ground up.

I don’t want to reinvent everything, but I definitely want to have a clear reason for why we do things other than “because that’s how it’s done.”

This is largely inspired by [Nick Kokonas](https://twitter.com/nickkokonas) (Alinea, [innovated on a bunch of stuff around restaurants](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/429-nick-kokonas-on-resurrecting-restaurants-skin-in/id863897795?i=1000473791021)) and Elon Musk (specifically talks about [first principles](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/billionaire-elon-musk-this-is-a-powerful-way-of-thinking-but-hard-to-do-how-it-works.html), goal of reducing cost of rocket launches by factor of 10).

Many restaurants do things poorly, do things without understanding why, and make errors in the game of business (even if they are excellent in the game of food).

Our goal is simply to be open to reconsidering which things work and why and hope to improve our odds of success.

We might still fail, but hey, won’t it be fun to watch us blog about it while we crash and burn?

**Some Theories For Things We Will Try**

Our main meta hypothesis on all this is to treat food like a tech business. So a lot of these ideas will not seem particularly innovative to tech/ecomm/internet business folks.

1. **No brick and mortar** - In researching buildout costs, talking to other kolache store owners, exploring kolache franchises, it would cost a ton to build out a space and it would take a ton of time. Pandemic is also not a great time for this. 
2. **Move fast / launch quickly / “Minimum Viable Product”** - Obviously the “don’t build out a space or a kitchen” is in this vein. Additionally, we’re trying to use an opinionated, minimal menu (only 4 kolache flavors) and get to market as quickly as possible lto validate kolache interest in Chicago as cheaply as possible 
3. **Build a launch list** - Just like an unsplash / “coming soon” landing page for a SaaS business, our goal is to build interest before we have product available so that we can launch to pre-orders. SaaS businesses have been doing this for a long time. 
4. **Model after DTC e-comm companies** - Casper, Allbirds, Everlane, Away etc - generate demand with the consumers directly and getting the product to them without the normal distribution channels. We want to try to do this. This is admittedly a bit weirder. Ghost kitchens, in a way, are kind of in this vein, but just moving their product through intermediaries like GrubHub, DoorDash, Caviar, etc. We want to advertise directly through Instagram and Facebook, have them buy our food for future delivery (not “on demand” food like delivery apps), and batch deliveries to compress costs. 
5. **Subscription Breakfast** - KaaS? (Kolaches as a Service?) Who doesn’t want hot, amazing, delicious breakfast delivered to their door every Saturday morning in the cold, terrible, Chicago winter? OK, maybe nobody wants it, but why is this not even attempted? Maybe it’s a terrible idea. Maybe it’s brilliant. We’ll tell you after we try it! 
6. **Social Media Native** - Building backwards from Instagrammability. I’ve always been inspired by the story of Grey Goose Vodka (tldr: [Sidney Frank](https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/bizfinance/biz/features/10816/) invented the brand first, designed it to be beautiful and eye catching, then made the Vodka. A story is as important as the product). Kolaches in Houston are DELICIOUS. But they aren’t INSTAGRAMMABLE. We're not the first people to think of prioritizing food or restaurants being “Instagrammable” (plenty of others, just Google it), but it seems to still be a less common practice, and we’re definitely the only kolache place in Chicago starting during a pandemic that’s at least trying to think about it this way.

,Entrepreneur,"Hi!  
I am 17 and I started a webdev business in May-June. As every business, one of the hardest but most important thing was to find customers. I did something I never expected to do and it was cold-calling. Big scary stuff for a socially-awkward 17 years old who has phone phobia. It took me legit 10 minutes before typing the phone number and calling the random shop I found that didn't have a website.

Most of the time, either I stumbled upon a voicemail, left a message and never got an answer, got transferred 2-3 times before being told ""call later"", got told to send them an email and never get an answer, get told that they aren't interested. Never once I got a positive answer on the 15\~ calls I made. However, amazing experience and my fear of phone calling went away and I am much more confortable with calling someone randomly.

I found that ""being out there"" was much, much more efficient. I found a 4000$ contact by meeting the CEO of a startup in a coworking space (the owner told him about my skills), I found two 800$ contracts by posting ads on Facebook (like, not paid, just random posts on the right groups) and I got a 2500$ and a 750$ contract by just contacting them on LinkedIn/Facebook. I find that writing is way better to convince someone, once you got their attention, they won't read the first few lines and stop reading. Naturally, their curiosity ends up with them reading the whole thing. It allows me to put my arguments on why they should hire me to make them a website.

,Entrepreneur,"Hello!

Long time lurker here. I've been experimenting with writing online and trying to make money while doing so. I've started to document my journey. Here's what I've learned. 

## Step 1: Create a Portfolio

People say you need experience before you can do anything. And the problem was I had zero writing experience. So I *created* experiences. How? I started rewriting other people's stuff.   For example, I opted into the email list of Lurn, the marketing company started by Anik Singal and I started re-writing some of their emails. Once I'd finished, I would add them to my portfolio which was a simple Google Doc. No fancy website, no time worrying about WordPress widgets and themes. Just a simple Google doc. 

## Step 2: Search Google like a Pro

You can search for anything on Google. True.  
But knowing HOW to search effectively is a skill. This is how I find companies hiring writers. 

Type **site:docs.google.com/spreadsheets hiring copywriters** on Google**,** you'll find a spreadsheet of companies using Google docs to find people like you to work for them remotely. (This is called indexing.)

You can also do the same with **Notion****.** Type **site:notion.so hiring** on Google and you'll find companies that are using Notion to hire people.

This is a creative way to look for roles using a simple Google search trick. Most people are missing out on this.

## Step 3: Fish where the Fish are

The Internet has opened the opportunity to everyone. You can find anyone with a few clicks. Finding people is easy. Finding the *right* people is hard.

Find the owners looking for copywriters and shoot a message. Make sure you are in alignment with their requirements - word for word. I've done this successfully on Upwork with a British copywriting agency. 

## Step 4: Join a Writing group

Learning from experts means you learn quicker. There's a lot to choose from. I've personally joined one. It's not cheap. The value is indisputable. My writing is 10x better than when I started 4 months ago.

Having my copy read by experts who've sold millions of dollars worth of products with words is the best personal investment I've made in 2020.

## Step 5: Reflection

If you're still unable to find any success, reconsider the steps you've been taking and also look for weak points and mistakes you are making.

Ask yourself:

\* Are you communicating the value you bring to a company?

\* Is your portfolio up to date and error-free?

\* Does it paint an attractive picture of all your skills?

\* Are you able to write effective follow-up emails to the hiring manager?

,Entrepreneur,"Hi all, my biz just reach a $80m valuation after a tonne of hard work but my click-bait title is designed to outline whats wrong in this Sub-reddit.

Unfortunately, most of the content here doesn't represent true entrepreneurs but rather wantrepreneurs that think you need a crazy idea to make it, you have too many great ideas and can't focus,  how you make a tonne of cash without working hard.

In this post, I am just going to lay out some home truths in the hope that maybe one person may not waste their hard earned money on a silly idea, or perhaps stop daydreaming and start doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Entrepreneurship is NOT about big ideas**

There are 5.6m [employer firms in the USA,](https://sbecouncil.org/about-us/facts-and-data/) thats at least 5.6m entrepreneurs in the USA. Most of these entrepreneurs have businesses in existing industries. People today have been poisoned by click bait regarding geniuses like Mr. Zuck or Page. &amp; Brin who have dominated their fields and created wealth beyond anyone's wildest dreams yet their ideas weren't original, [Google wasn't the first search engine.](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/how-search-worked-before-google-1703.html) It wasn't the second, not even the third.

Successful business is all about execution. A great team with a dull and mundane product are so much more likely to get succeess than a college grad with a big dream.

* If you feel that being an entrepreneur requires a big idea, you are a wantrepreneur
* If you carry a notebook with all yout great ideas, you are a wantrepreneur.
* If you have so many great ideas but just lack focus (also known as as the ability to execute well), you are a wantrepreneur

Every headhunter that starts their own headhunting firm is an entrepreneur and they aren't doing anything massively different, they just back themselves to execute better. Lawyers who make their own practices are entrepreneurs, you don't need to create the next automated legal subscription service to be an entrepreneur.

Either learn a business, get great, save up and then launch a slightly differentiated business or focus on looking for problems in the job you currently are doing.

Stop dreaming, start executing

&amp;#x200B;

**Successful entrepreneurs spend more time empowering others to build their business**

A lot of people lurking around this sub seem to relish the idea of bring their big idea to life. I have news for you; this process is maybe 6-18months of your business. The rest is incremental improvements and empowering others to grow your business further.

Maybe you are working in a 9-5 job and dreaming via this sub is a way to keep you sane but remember when you have 100 people working for you, you have 100 people potentially thinking of ways to move to the next thing. Who doesn't want to be a tech millionaire! Remember, you probably think you are under-paid and under-appreciated but every person you employ will think similar!

Even if you have the experience, drive and ingenuity to build the beginnings of a business, you can only grow it so much before you need to rely on others. If you cannot empower those people, you will not execute and you will not succeed.

A manager who knows how to empower and excite their sub-ordinates is so much more value than someone who wants to create 'strategy' all the time. If you don't have this skill yet, you will need a co-founder does or you will need to get more corporate experience

&amp;#x200B;

**Businesses aren't built for you**

Many posts on this sub talk are variants of get rich quick schemes or figuring out how to 'side hustle'. At the heart of it, many wantrepreneurs think that working for themselves will bring immense freedom and untold riches.

When you employ 100 people, you are **responsible** for the livelihoods of 100 people. You are priority 2 vs your staff. Businesses need people and people need to believe that their fearless leader can make great outcomes for them!

Think about that for a second. Are you mature enough to be responsible for 100 families rent or mortgage? Do you realize that a silly decision on your side could actually create financial hardship for others?

If your business is not built to make your employees lives better, your great employees will churn out and your business and you will not succeed.

When you look at your spreadsheet imaginging the $100m net income from your online bow-tie emporium, just remember, those 'staff' numbers will become real people. Be prepared to look after them.

Managing your staff well is worth 100x that zany, crazy idea.... soz

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do you want to be an entrepreneur?**

I think that by now I can call myself a successful entrepreneur and while I am a wealthy human on paper, I am grinding and saving like everyone else. In fact, my sister who is a few years younger than me and who works in law earns **triple** what I do whilst complaining that she doesn't have the work freedom.

If you just want to be wealthy, without the hassle of all the above, try your best to get into those premier industries and make a career out of it. If you aren't fortunate enough to be able to move into Law, medicine, finance etc then excel at what you are currently doing and then do exactly the same thing yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that is enough of a rant. Dreaming is great because the thought of being successful can fill that emotional void but unfortunately it isn't real. Furthermore, if you think that being an entrepreneur means being the next Zuck or equivalent, you are essentially trying to replicate 0.01% of successful entrepreneurs as opposed to the 99.99% unsung business owners out there

&lt;p&gt;When you look at your spreadsheet imaginging the $100m net income from your online bow-tie emporium, just remember, those &amp;#39;staff&amp;#39; numbers will become real people. Be prepared to look after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing your staff well is worth 100x that zany, crazy idea.... soz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you want to be an entrepreneur?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that by now I can call myself a successful entrepreneur and while I am a wealthy human on paper, I am grinding and saving like everyone else. In fact, my sister who is a few years younger than me and who works in law earns &lt;strong&gt;triple&lt;/strong&gt; what I do whilst complaining that she doesn&amp;#39;t have the work freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just want to be wealthy, without the hassle of all the above, try your best to get into those premier industries and make a career out of it. If you aren&amp;#39;t fortunate enough to be able to move into Law, medicine, finance etc then excel at what you are currently doing and then do exactly the same thing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that is enough of a rant. Dreaming is great because the thought of being successful can fill that emotional void but unfortunately it isn&amp;#39;t real. Furthermore, if you think that being an entrepreneur means being the next Zuck or equivalent, you are essentially trying to replicate 0.01% of successful entrepreneurs as opposed to the 99.99% unsung business owners out there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all!&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"I have an idea for a business to start that I've been thinking about for a while now. It's pretty simple actually, just an outdoor beach volleyball business. I would operate a league that runs from May to September. Depending on market research, I would have a number of courts with games most evenings of the week. This would be one source of revenue. The other source would be a small kitchen that serves alcohol and a small menu. This could even be just a food truck parked on the property. All seating would be outdoors. (I would would have to confirm this is okay with the liquor and gaming commission in my area).  

As for numbers, if for example I had 3 volleyball courts, I could have 6 teams play on each court per night, so 18 total. There would be two 2.5 month long seasons and each team would pay $650 per season. So if there are games 6 nights a week, that would be roughly $163k from the volleyball along.

- land requirement may be an issue. There will be quite a few vehicles that need parking and the courts themselves take up decent amount of space.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

Before I start, I want to provide a disclaimer that this post is not for the people who have businesses/clients that sell something normal (like dish soap).

Some of our clients sell products that are pretty general, so we don't always use this strategy, but when we get a chance, we do incorporate this strategy in their businesses as well, and it works most of the time.

This is for mainly the businesses that sell CPGs, have an E-Commerce brand, etc.

When you advertise what are you usually trying to do?

Is it just optimisations based on a great ""offer""? Or scroll-stopping creative designs? Etc?
Which is great, and if you're running ads, you should definitely do these things.
Great way to increase your conversions.

But what do you do once they've entered your ""world""? When they buy one of your products? Or follow you on social media?

Are you evoking any kind of emotions when they look at your social media? Or go through your website? Or read your e-mails?

Because believe it or not, if you don't bring out emotions within these people, they are not going to stay with you for long.

Now, what type of emotions am I talking about?
- Emotions where they feel smart. (Informed)
- Where they feel inspired.
- Where they feel happy. (Entertained)
- Etc

You need to evoke the good emotions within them, either when they look at your posts, or when they use your products (or both).

The more you bring-out these emotions, the more they want that feeling from you and/or your products.

Some tactical ways to bring-out these emotions, with some of the examples we've used with our own clients:-

- Study industry trends:-
Listen to what's happening in your industry, and share it in a way that has a unique voice to it (of your brand).
For example:- One of our clients who is in the beauty space wanted to launch a product with ""red clay"" in it.

Now this ingredient is in a rise within the beauty space, so riding this wave, we started creating content/creatives around the benefits of red clay, which made our audience feel informed about how to take better care of their skin.
This resulted in people asking more information about red clay, which helped us get a good no. of conversions when the product was launched.

- Use trendy culture outside of your industry:-
Listen to what's happening around the world, and use that to your advantage.
For example:- One of our clients who sells dog grooming products, and has a mascot for their brand is a perfect example for this. When the show ""Money Heist"" was trending, we used it to create our own version of ""Dog Heist"" with the use of our client's mascot, and we created a 4 part series of carousel posts with an interesting story.
This helped create a good deal of organic shares, and people loved reading it.

So learn what's happening around you, and use it to our advantage in a creative way.

- Understand their problems:-
There's a long list of businesses that go the simple route of ""Here's your problem, we have the solution, so buy"".

But have you ever tried talking to them about the problems they're facing? If you sell protein shakes, have you ever talked about fat-shaming? If you sell chocolate, have you talked about the emotions we go through after a break-up? If you sell life insurance, have you talked about your customer's fear of leaving their family alone after they die?

Understanding your customer, or in other words, being ""authentic"" as a brand, has given exponential growth to so many upcoming brands, and I feel we're just getting started, we'll see more of these brands popping up in the coming years.

What's your point Kushal?

My point is, if you want to make customers come back, follow you and talk about you. You need to make them feel something, because if you can't, you are just another logo that sells face wash to them.",t2_1uf9artg,False,,0,False,Are you really evoking any kind of emotions?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'How to Grow'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_k03kto,False,dark,0.25,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},How to Grow,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606247349.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I start, I want to provide a disclaimer that this post is not for the people who have businesses/clients that sell something normal (like dish soap).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our clients sell products that are pretty general, so we don&amp;#39;t always use this strategy, but when we get a chance, we do incorporate this strategy in their businesses as well, and it works most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for mainly the businesses that sell CPGs, have an E-Commerce brand, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you advertise what are you usually trying to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it just optimisations based on a great &amp;quot;offer&amp;quot;? Or scroll-stopping creative designs? Etc?
Which is great, and if you&amp;#39;re running ads, you should definitely do these things.
Great way to increase your conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what do you do once they&amp;#39;ve entered your &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;? When they buy one of your products? Or follow you on social media?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you evoking any kind of emotions when they look at your social media? Or go through your website? Or read your e-mails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because believe it or not, if you don&amp;#39;t bring out emotions within these people, they are not going to stay with you for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what type of emotions am I talking about?
- Emotions where they feel smart. (Informed)
- Where they feel inspired.
- Where they feel happy. (Entertained)
- Etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to evoke the good emotions within them, either when they look at your posts, or when they use your products (or both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you bring-out these emotions, the more they want that feeling from you and/or your products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tactical ways to bring-out these emotions, with some of the examples we&amp;#39;ve used with our own clients:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study industry trends:-
Listen to what&amp;#39;s happening in your industry, and share it in a way that has a unique voice to it (of your brand).
For example:- One of our clients who is in the beauty space wanted to launch a product with &amp;quot;red clay&amp;quot; in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this ingredient is in a rise within the beauty space, so riding this wave, we started creating content/creatives around the benefits of red clay, which made our audience feel informed about how to take better care of their skin.
This resulted in people asking more information about red clay, which helped us get a good no. of conversions when the product was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use trendy culture outside of your industry:-
Listen to what&amp;#39;s happening around the world, and use that to your advantage.
For example:- One of our clients who sells dog grooming products, and has a mascot for their brand is a perfect example for this. When the show &amp;quot;Money Heist&amp;quot; was trending, we used it to create our own version of &amp;quot;Dog Heist&amp;quot; with the use of our client&amp;#39;s mascot, and we created a 4 part series of carousel posts with an interesting story.
This helped create a good deal of organic shares, and people loved reading it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So learn what&amp;#39;s happening around you, and use it to our advantage in a creative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand their problems:-
There&amp;#39;s a long list of businesses that go the simple route of &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s your problem, we have the solution, so buy&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But have you ever tried talking to them about the problems they&amp;#39;re facing? If you sell protein shakes, have you ever talked about fat-shaming? If you sell chocolate, have you talked about the emotions we go through after a break-up? If you sell life insurance, have you talked about your customer&amp;#39;s fear of leaving their family alone after they die?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding your customer, or in other words, being &amp;quot;authentic&amp;quot; as a brand, has given exponential growth to so many upcoming brands, and I feel we&amp;#39;re just getting started, we&amp;#39;ll see more of these brands popping up in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your point Kushal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is, if you want to make customers come back, follow you and talk about you. You need to make them feel something, because if you can&amp;#39;t, you are just another logo that sells face wash to them.&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur," Hey guys!

I have a few questions more so related to my fellow Canadians! I've been researching about Amazon FBA for the past few weeks now and I plan on doing this with a friend - just on the side at first and see if we can genuinely make a decent ROI and grow from there.

We noticed a lot of entrepreneurs purchase their products off Alibaba and ship it to directly to their home (in the u.s). As Canadians this isn't very feasible considering we would have to pay for shipping again to ship to the U.S after packaging the products ourselves.

The best choice would be having the supplier in China package and ship the products using a freight forwarder in China \*by air\*. Do most Canadians do this? If so what's the entire process like?

Do you need to create your own label (with your brand image) include a UPC barcode you buy off ebay to the supplier to add on each unit after it's been packaged?

,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I have been in this sub for a long time and learned alot from you! So far I always read but never posted. Today I want to share my experiences with you about dropshipping/sourcing from China.

**1.** **My background**I currently have two eCommerce sites. One is a boutique clothing site and my latest project is a medical face mask website. Like many of you here, I generate my traffic through Instagram botting, SEO, email marketing and other free/cheap methods.

**2. Why you shouldn’t use Aliexpress**Thousands of people dropship the same products from Aliexpress. customers are not stupid, they see all the same products over and over again and already know about Aliexpress.

Many of the sellers on Aliexpress are actually just resellers from manufacturers and therefore take their own cut. This means your margin will be lower, since you basically have another person in your value chain.

There are many other Chinese sites that are not as flooded with people and still provide the same or even cheaper prices. I recommend using Taobao.com, jd.com and pinduoduo.com (not affiliated with any of those sites).

All of those sites are mainly in Chinese and Google Translate can help you with that if you don’t speak that language. To make things easier and to get even better prices you could find a sourcing agent (e.g. b2btradeworld.com – again not affiliated) to help you source products directly from the manufacturers. They usually know the difference between a manufacturer and a wholesaler. They’re even able to check the samples directly for you and send you images or videos for you to see.

**3. Some additional tips**

* Always order samples before you make a huge order. Minimum order quantity (MOQ) is often negotiable, but you have to seem professional.
* Always try to use e-packet as your shipping method (unless there’s something cheaper and faster)
* Avoid sourcing any electronics or any product with batteries.

Mindset by Carol S. Dweck
 
 
 
 
To achieve any form of success in your personal or professional life, a strong belief in yourself and your capabilities is the first key ingredient you must have. Developing a strong belief in yourself, a positive mindset, is very important. If you want success in important areas of your life, you simply must believe in your ability to better yourself
 
 
“This is something I know for a fact: You have to work hardest for the things you love most.”
 
 
Carol Dweck’s book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, is the most informative and actionable book on how to develop a healthy self-esteem—a strong and positive mindset—that cements belief in your growth. 
 
 
If you’re interested in this book you can get 2 audiobooks for free with a trial of audible using the link in the description of this video. Subscribe and turn on the notification bell so you don’t miss any future summaries.
 
 
 
 
The Premise Of The Book
 
 
The two mindsets—a fixed and growth mindset–are the foundation upon which Carol Dweck builds her groundbreaking work and book. From her research on the subject of achievement, she discovered that what someone believes of his or her ability is fundamental to the kind and level of success one can achieve. It is from this research that she unearthed the two mindsets.
 
 
Her book talks about both mindsets and offers readers invaluable insight into how best to become growth-minded and apply the positive mindset in all areas of their life including parenting, career, and interpersonal relations.
 
 
“A growth mindset is belief you can develop abilities.”
 
 
This book summary outlines the most actionable strategies discussed in Dweck’s book:
 
 
 
 
Lesson 1: Growth Requires Effort
 
 
What is more important, effort or ability? Ability vs. effort is one of the most defining characteristics of Dweck’s book. In fact, Dweck main area of focus—in her research and in the book—is illustrating how, through effort, a positive belief in the ability to better ourselves, those with a growth mindset can achieve far more than those who with a fixed mindset, the belief that ability is constant. 
 
 
“No matter what your ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.”
 
 
When you believe that ability or talent is all it takes to accomplish, achieve, or attain, this belief actually hinders your personal growth because when you believe that ability is a fixed trait, you essentially diminish the value of learning, growing, and developing through consistent effort. 
 
 
A fundamental aspect of the growth mindset, the topic Dweck concentrates on disseminating, is the strong belief that all growth or improvement requires effort. 
 
 
When you have a fixed mindset instead of a growth one, you associate your ability or ‘talent’ to your self-esteem/self-identity, which is not healthy because when you attach your self-identity to your abilities, you shun challenges that may lead to failure, which denies you a chance to improve. 
 
 
“Becoming is better than being”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 2: Change Your Life By Adopting A Growth Mindset
 
 
Dweck does an amazing job of illustrating the power of a growth mindset. She also does an amazing job of showing her readers how to shift their mindset from a fixed one to a growth one.
 
 
The most life-changing information Carol Dweck shares is that it is possible to have a growth in some areas of your life and a fixed mindset in other areas. 
 
 
“It’s also important to realize that even if people have a fixed mindset, they’re not always in that mindset.  In fact, in many of our studies, we put people into a growth mindset. We tell them that an ability can be learned and that the task will give them a chance to do that or we have them read a scientific article that teaches them the growth mindset.  The article describes people who did not have natural ability, but who developed exceptional skills.  These experiences make our research participants into growth-minded thinkers, at least for the moment — and they act like growth-minded thinkers, too.”
 
 
From these discussions, Carol concludes that the best way to change your life is to change your perspective (mindset); instead of seeing your “abilities” as fixed, start seeing your life—and all your undertakings–as malleable, something you can learn from and through commendable effort, grow through. The best and easiest way to change your life is by changing how you look at your circumstances and life in general.
 
 
“Mindsets are an important part of your personality, but you can change them. Just by knowing about the two mindsets, you can start thinking and reacting in new ways.  People tell me that they start to catch themselves when they are in the throes of the fixed mindset — passing up a chance for learning, feeling labeled by a failure, or getting discouraged when something requires a lot of effort.  And then they switch themselves into the growth mindset — making sure they take the challenge, learn from the failure, or continue their effort. “
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
Always be taking consistent action towards your aims.
 
 
“Effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment.”
 
 
 
 
I hope that was useful, have a great day!

,Entrepreneur,"Hey There,

Friend of mine has a niche Instagram page that blew up from a few hundred followers to nearly 15k over the past year. Purely organic.

He gets a ton of engagement and his follower base is definitely high quality / engages heavily. 

At the moment his content is based around his keyboard / synth collection which features a lot of rare &amp; vintage synths, instruments etc... Lots of videos of jamming, making music, fixing instruments and very genuinely made. Also very much so focused on synthesizers, keyboards, drum machines and other ""gear"".

My friends expressed that he doesn't want to ""cop out"" and monetize in a way that will cheapen the fun he's having with his audience. He really does this stuff because he enjoys it. He receives DMs from legitimate EDM producers / musicians that want to jam, see his collection or potentially even produce beats / music for them as well.

I'm just trying to help share a couple ideas his way that could help him monetize this audience tastefully.

Obviously I think if he had a brand / website which offered merch that wouldn't hurt. But I'm not sure how interested he is in building all that out, not enough time to make music then haha. 

I figured if he kitted his studio with better lighting and a solid camera, he could probably livestream sets. But I'm not sure how popular the music-livestream side is comparatively to gamers.

I also pitched the idea of starting a technical youtube channel which has tutorials on his repairs, certain instruments etc... That could certainly build up the opportunity for passive ad rev + partnership deals.

Also, we work together with several personal trainers so we can offer pre-defined workouts.

I hope you enjoy it.

The app is made 100% with react native.

#### Ok, Why Grow Your Email/Newsletter?

#### IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS OR LIKE EARNING MONEY…

Whether it's Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok, if you build on their platform, they own your followers - you don't. Going back to [their inception](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-screws-social-media-marketers-2013-12), they have systematically been optimizing you to pay more, for fewer eyeballs. Anyone who has ever tried to sell on Amazon or run ads on Google or FB knows what we are talking about. Not to mention they have a pesky habit of ya know, disappearing, like Snapchat, MySpace, and even AOL IM for all you 90's babies.

So the ONLY place you have real control over is your website and your email list. It’s the kingdom no Zuckerberg, Amazon or Newsom can stage a coupe within.

That is why it’s imperative you figure out how to grow those you can email.

So anyway we broke down our exact process so hopefully it helps you scale fast as well:

I don’t profess to be a guru at this. Just relentlessly documenting the journey to growth: Here’s status as of last month:

* 100k+ subscribers at [Contrarian Thinking](https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/).
* 15k subscribers at [Unconventional Acquisitions](https://www.unconventionalacquisitions.com/)
* 2k subscribers at [Grow Getters](https://growgetters.substack.com/) (where we break down how to hack email growth each week)

So across the ecosystem with those and email lists for EEC (our VC fund) we’re sitting around 200k followers. Goal = 1 million.

### BUT BEFORE WE START, ON DAY ONE WE WERE: Just our moms basically.

**Good news, that changed.**

## So here's How I Got My First 10,000 Subscribers in 30 Days

My embarrassing (I failed and looked silly a lot) rearview mirror look into how I built my newsletter to 10,000 in 30 days.

**Take, tweak and use for your own.**

### Day One: (No One Cares ‘Cept Me)

* Get the idea from my friends at [the Dispatch](https://www.thedispatch.com/) who launched a paid newsletter and made $1MM in less than a year. Ears perked.
* Spend evening looking through Evernote on things that get me fired up to talk about.
* Get amped up from my hubs and friend Joe saying they’d read mine… first 2 subscribers (takes a bow).
* Come up with name Contrarian Thinking by looking through my journals.
* Draft a welcome email, [about me section](https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/p/coming-soon), and a first post (Thinking Critically &amp; Why it Matters) [here](https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/p/youre-invited-thinking-critically).

### Day Two: 0 - 102 People Who Care

* I create a [mailchimp](https://www.mailchimp.com/) account (it’s basically free)
* I use Squarespace’s [free logo creator](https://www.squarespace.com/logo) for original logo. Kinda lame but FAST AND did I say, FREE.
* Pull a list of all my emails in gmail, phone and old mailchimp accounts (1,000+ in total) and send them an opt in email.
* **102(ish) people do it… that tickles my little heart**
* Don’t love those first emails (and they were all in mailchimp) but [here’s a sample](https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/p/youre-invited-thinking-critically?r=26ke5&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy)

### Day Three: 0 - 135 People Who Care

* I send an email to my buds explaining what the newsletter is and why.
* Send it to 50 people I think highly of and ask them to forward it.
* Friends respond and get me even more amped up. **Email list up to 135 now.**  


### Day Four: 0 - 167 People Who Care

* I add a pop up on my site using Squarespace templates at codiesanchez.com
* I update the first signup box on my website to link to the newsletter signup
* I use [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/) images because I hate stock photos.
* I post on LinkedIn and get good engagement. 5 newbies join.
* I tried Reddit and failed, got my posts deleted from 3 groups. I knew nothing about Reddit and felt like a boomer doing a Tik-Tok vide.
   * I post in facebook groups, Masterminds I’m in w/ people who know me. (5 in total) 27 people join. Here’s an example but couldn’t find originals.

### Day Five: 0 - 253

* I’m over Mailchimp, too designed, doesn’t have paid and most importantly doesn’t have a community. Aka no comments and historical posts.
* I Sign up for Substack and read how to get your [first 100 subscribers](https://on.substack.com/p/getting-your-first-100-signups#:~:text=Link%20to%20your%20publication%20everywhere%20you%20can.&amp;text=Add%20your%20Substack%20URL%20to,top%20of%20your%20Twitter%20feed.), [first 2,000](https://on.substack.com/p/how-delia-cai-grew-deez-links-from) and [first 5,000](https://on.substack.com/p/zero-to-) subscribers.
* I create a folder for newsletters I like in my gmail, and start creating content
* I make a list for growth hackers on twitter to help cross-pollinate tweets.
* The posts on LinkedIn, Facebook pick up some steam. Pass 250 sign ups.

### Day Six: 0 - 300+

* I post on twitter and on Instagram. 22 signups.
* Instagram stories with a swipe up to subscribe link work. I’ll do them weekly.
* I put it in my bio link on Twitter and Instagram 13 signups.
* Brainstorm growth ideas in a google doc (now need to actually do them)

### Day Six: 0 - 421+

* I come up with a content calendar - post every week at weds at 9:15am
* Issue goes out - 82% open rate, 46% click rate. (Because basically only my mom on there and she better f\*ing click).
* I start hosting a weekly webinar with [Arcview Group ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_investing-smallbusiness-activity-6668896737345777664-XM-b)\- grows my LinkedIn by 4,000 so I use that to post more on LinkedIn and get a 100+ subscribers.

### Day Seven: 0 - 422+ (shitty day not much growth)

* A couple of the LinkedIn posts get zero engagement, feel a bit embarrassed
* Lots of what I posted don’t do well and fall flat

### Week 2: 0 - 1790+ (kicking into gear)

* I want to work smarter, not harder by using my relationships with bigger followings
* I make a list of friends who have podcasts, I get myself on a couple of them. Generate 100’s of subscribers in following days/wks (10 podcasts in 2 weeks).
* Include buttons to share in my post those work: [Share](https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/p/how-i-got-my-first-10000-newsletter?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNjY1NTk3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNjUzMjEzLCJpYXQiOjE2MDYxNDY1MzEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi02NzYyNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.9cIaW0L_Cx04qE3oWetQj853Z6eV0v8N990y6giHDFU&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share)
* Ask if I can email a few of the businesses I invest in’s lists (15k+ subscribers) with a giveaway and an opportunity to sign up. A few say yes.
* Create a flywheel and a process to use all my different social sites to spin faster

### Week 3: 0 - 3800+ (2x growth of previous week)

* Podcasts start hitting and I see subscribers grow
* Create a list of all media to hit them up when we have new ideas or content
* Posts and flywheel start hitting
* Twitter reposting and including links didn’t get huge engagement but 10-20 signups
* What did work is tagging bigger accounts Flippa, it even led to me being on their blog and podcast and chatting w/ their CEO. [Example here](https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1294273824536526853).
* I create a [lead magnet](https://www.codiesanchez.com/) and insert on website, post it on socials (400+ signups).
* I used [Designrr](https://designrr.io/) to auto take blog posts and turn them into e-books

### Week 4: 0 - 11,000+ (Nailed it!)

* A few of the first podcasts (and then webinars) I did didn’t do very well, then I started adding a quick link and the giveaway - that worked well in converting subscribers to the tune of a few thousand.
* I also started offering a discount code for one of my courses of 50% for each podcast and that led lots of people to take action
* I REALLY have done well with LinkedIn so I added a weekly video segment, super simple filmed on my iPhone and have had some great engagement and some that ABSOLUTELY no one watched.
* I changed my podcasts/webinars o be laser focused on buying businesses which drew people in
* Used [YEC’s](https://yec.co/) (a mastermind I’m in) ability to guest blog [post on Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/08/26/an-unconventional-idea-for-a-small-profitable-business/) etc and link to my newsletter.

**Ooof, what a month.**

**Certainly was work, but my hope is people stop obsessing about ad spend and spammy ads and instead look at ways to grow organically as well.**

&lt;h3&gt;Day Two: 0 - 102 People Who Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I use Squarespace’s &lt;a href=""https://www.squarespace.com/logo""&gt;free logo creator&lt;/a&gt; for original logo. Kinda lame but FAST AND did I say, FREE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull a list of all my emails in gmail, phone and old mailchimp accounts (1,000+ in total) and send them an opt in email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;102(ish) people do it… that tickles my little heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t love those first emails (and they were all in mailchimp) but &lt;a href=""https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/p/youre-invited-thinking-critically?r=26ke5&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy""&gt;here’s a sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day Three: 0 - 135 People Who Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I send an email to my buds explaining what the newsletter is and why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send it to 50 people I think highly of and ask them to forward it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friends respond and get me even more amped up. &lt;strong&gt;Email list up to 135 now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day Four: 0 - 167 People Who Care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I add a pop up on my site using Squarespace templates at codiesanchez.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I update the first signup box on my website to link to the newsletter signup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;a href=""https://unsplash.com/s/photos/""&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; images because I hate stock photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I post on LinkedIn and get good engagement. 5 newbies join.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried Reddit and failed, got my posts deleted from 3 groups. I knew nothing about Reddit and felt like a boomer doing a Tik-Tok vide.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I post in facebook groups, Masterminds I’m in w/ people who know me. (5 in total) 27 people join. Here’s an example but couldn’t find originals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day Five: 0 - 253&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m over Mailchimp, too designed, doesn’t have paid and most importantly doesn’t have a community. Aka no comments and historical posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I Sign up for Substack and read how to get your &lt;a href=""https://on.substack.com/p/getting-your-first-100-signups#:%7E:text=Link%20to%20your%20publication%20everywhere%20you%20can.&amp;amp;text=Add%20your%20Substack%20URL%20to,top%20of%20your%20Twitter%20feed.""&gt;first 100 subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://on.substack.com/p/how-delia-cai-grew-deez-links-from""&gt;first 2,000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://on.substack.com/p/zero-to-""&gt;first 5,000&lt;/a&gt; subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I create a folder for newsletters I like in my gmail, and start creating content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make a list for growth hackers on twitter to help cross-pollinate tweets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The posts on LinkedIn, Facebook pick up some steam. Pass 250 sign ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day Six: 0 - 300+&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I post on twitter and on Instagram. 22 signups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram stories with a swipe up to subscribe link work. I’ll do them weekly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I put it in my bio link on Twitter and Instagram 13 signups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brainstorm growth ideas in a google doc (now need to actually do them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day Six: 0 - 421+&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I come up with a content calendar - post every week at weds at 9:15am&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issue goes out - 82% open rate, 46% click rate. (Because basically only my mom on there and she better f*ing click).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start hosting a weekly webinar with &lt;a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codiesanchez_investing-smallbusiness-activity-6668896737345777664-XM-b""&gt;Arcview Group &lt;/a&gt;- grows my LinkedIn by 4,000 so I use that to post more on LinkedIn and get a 100+ subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day Seven: 0 - 422+ (shitty day not much growth)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of the LinkedIn posts get zero engagement, feel a bit embarrassed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of what I posted don’t do well and fall flat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Week 2: 0 - 1790+ (kicking into gear)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to work smarter, not harder by using my relationships with bigger followings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make a list of friends who have podcasts, I get myself on a couple of them. Generate 100’s of subscribers in following days/wks (10 podcasts in 2 weeks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include buttons to share in my post those work: &lt;a href=""https://contrarianthinking.substack.com/p/how-i-got-my-first-10000-newsletter?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjozNjY1NTk3LCJwb3N0X2lkIjoxNjUzMjEzLCJpYXQiOjE2MDYxNDY1MzEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi02NzYyNyIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.9cIaW0L_Cx04qE3oWetQj853Z6eV0v8N990y6giHDFU&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share""&gt;Share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask if I can email a few of the businesses I invest in’s lists (15k+ subscribers) with a giveaway and an opportunity to sign up. A few say yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a flywheel and a process to use all my different social sites to spin faster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Week 3: 0 - 3800+ (2x growth of previous week)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Podcasts start hitting and I see subscribers grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a list of all media to hit them up when we have new ideas or content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posts and flywheel start hitting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter reposting and including links didn’t get huge engagement but 10-20 signups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What did work is tagging bigger accounts Flippa, it even led to me being on their blog and podcast and chatting w/ their CEO. &lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/Codie_Sanchez/status/1294273824536526853""&gt;Example here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I create a &lt;a href=""https://www.codiesanchez.com/""&gt;lead magnet&lt;/a&gt; and insert on website, post it on socials (400+ signups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used &lt;a href=""https://designrr.io/""&gt;Designrr&lt;/a&gt; to auto take blog posts and turn them into e-books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Week 4: 0 - 11,000+ (Nailed it!)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few of the first podcasts (and then webinars) I did didn’t do very well, then I started adding a quick link and the giveaway - that worked well in converting subscribers to the tune of a few thousand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also started offering a discount code for one of my courses of 50% for each podcast and that led lots of people to take action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I REALLY have done well with LinkedIn so I added a weekly video segment, super simple filmed on my iPhone and have had some great engagement and some that ABSOLUTELY no one watched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I changed my podcasts/webinars o be laser focused on buying businesses which drew people in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used &lt;a href=""https://yec.co/""&gt;YEC’s&lt;/a&gt; (a mastermind I’m in) ability to guest blog &lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/08/26/an-unconventional-idea-for-a-small-profitable-business/""&gt;post on Forbes&lt;/a&gt; etc and link to my newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooof, what a month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certainly was work, but my hope is people stop obsessing about ad spend and spammy ads and instead look at ways to grow organically as well.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://growgetters.substack.com/p/coming-soon""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GROW GETTERS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Breaks down the weekly how.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love to hear anyone else&amp;#39;s ideas or what works for you??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Is asking for help in such a direct way allowed here? I'm not entirely sure, but I guess we will find out. If nothing else, I'm sure a lot of people on this thread can relate to this and might be in the same exact predicament I'm in.

The stated predicament is as follows; I am inherently lost. Ever since I was a kid, all I wanted was to be a business man. Corner office, secretary, the way they glorified it in all the movies. Now, obviously, as I got older, my definition changed. But the fact still remained; I wanted to run a business. The 9-5 petrified me. I was born with a disability, which limits me physically and completely dictates what jobs I can and can't do. Not to mention I loathed the idea of working under someone who makes maybe three dollars more than I do for a billion dollar company that really didn't value me or made a difference in the world. To be fair, I fought it for a long time, not getting a job at all until I absolutely had to. And by that point, I doubled up, working at my local movie theater and obtaining an incredible internship for my college. Ironically, I fell in love with both places besides the terrible pay, but Covid laid me off from both of those. Here I am now, starting over again, in a new city at a new school, wondering how to approach the new year.

As I stated, I've always wanted to be a entrepreneur. The only issue is, I suck at it. I can't count on two fingers how many business ideas I've pursued and poured money and time into only to have it fall completely on its tail. I've read just about every book on the subject, taken courses, watched videos. But, I think we all know none of that is what makes a business successful. Then again, what would I know on that subject? To preface, the closest I got to success was my photography business. I was making decent money (or so I thought) at the time, but it's one of the most cut-throat industries out there. It's just other photographers saying they'll do a better job for cheaper until everyone's devalued down to nothing. That was my issue; I knew my photography was incredible and unique, yet I was being viewed as just another photographer. 

The decision to abandon capitalizing on my photography sent me spiraling into other things; website design, videography, event live streaming, even an online course taking website. None of which panned out. At this point, I am desperate. I've almost completed my Bachelors in Media &amp; Communications, specializing in Marketing with a Minor in Writing.

,Entrepreneur,"I made a simple landing page maker as I believe there's a gap in the market. I placed some PPC ads, and used my landing page maker to create a landing page to collect email addresses for people that might be interested. It worked, I have a few people that are interested!

At the moment the tool can edit a landing page template, host it and collect email addresses, but that is literally it. The glaring missing features would be login and billing. I'm wondering if I should reach out to my (tiny) mailing list now, or wait until I have a more complete product.

The template editor uses hidden 'magic' links like this:

[www.xyzwhatever.co/c6e6e6ae-d3be-4631-b8d8-7cb1ae704b93](https://www.xyzwhatever.co/c6e6e6ae-d3be-4631-b8d8-7cb1ae704b93) (not real site)

And public pages like this:

[www.xyzwhatever.co/152ba6d4](http://www.xyzwhatever.co/152ba6d4) (not real site)

Is this super shitty and completely non-credible or would this be viewed as an acceptable way to work? I'm only looking for feedback at this point, not to charge people. (Maybe 3 months free or whatever.)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.xyzwhatever.co/c6e6e6ae-d3be-4631-b8d8-7cb1ae704b93""&gt;www.xyzwhatever.co/c6e6e6ae-d3be-4631-b8d8-7cb1ae704b93&lt;/a&gt; (not real site)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And public pages like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.xyzwhatever.co/152ba6d4""&gt;www.xyzwhatever.co/152ba6d4&lt;/a&gt; (not real site)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this super shitty and completely non-credible or would this be viewed as an acceptable way to work? I&amp;#39;m only looking for feedback at this point, not to charge people. (Maybe 3 months free or whatever.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts are gratefully received.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems like a good opportunity, because it will give my business a healthy influx of money to develop and manufacture products for my own (much smaller) brand. 

Now each product takes me anywhere from 3 to 7 months to formulate from start to finish, because of the sheer amount of research that is required. My partner and I took months to create the line of products that we are selling under our own brand name currently. 

With the effort that we will undoubtedly have to put in to develop a special product for this company, should I negotiate a royalty percentage based on the sales of the product? Or should I settle for the continued business that we will get by manufacturing their product for them in bulk?

,Entrepreneur,"A short introduction on myself. I'm an engineering student but halfway in college I realized what I want to do is to lead a team or company to do great things and inspire other people. I don't see myself becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos, I don't even see myself being in Forbes' rich list. I just feel that doing business is what I am passionate about, particularly founding and developing a startup company.

I am very inspired. I have all the motivation in the world and in fact, even without motivation, I would still try to get into a business career. I started reading tons of books (40+ books) about business (even read books like Good to Great, The Lean Startup, The Effective Executive etc), started reading lots of business articles as well. This all happened this year.

Now my problem is, despite all the efforts I have made out of my interest in business, I still don't know where to start because I have zero business skills. All the books I read don't teach you essential business skills like they do in business schools. I thought of taking an MBA but I found out that MBA requires not just a business degree, but real-world experience as well. So I decided an MBA isn't for me. An option I'm considering is take online business courses but I'm hesitant because there's plenty of them and I don't know what are the exact skills I need to start a career in business.

Basically, I'm an engineering student with engineering skills, but I want to become an entrepreneur/businessman and I have no skills that I can use for that goal. I am willing to learn, I have saved up some money for the said online courses but I just don't know what are the particular knowledge and skills I have to learn to get started.

Can anyone offer some advice here? It will be greatly appreciated, thanks a lot!!

I always wanted to have my own business and I am going to college as a way to have a backup plan in case stuff don&amp;#39;t go the way I want them too. I need college as backup because my household will rely on me later on. I just wanted to ask you guys how much of a negative effect will more student loans have on me wanting to create my own business. I am looking to create my own business either during college which I am currently working on or right after. My business will be most likely based on a app since I code. Should I transfer to the better school and take the larger student loans or stay at a current university and sacrifice whatever a more prestigious university will give. I am looking at either NYU or USC to transfer to and I will go in as a comp sci major.&lt;/p&gt;

But because the sale is of the request, and the fact that I pay user A immediately, refunds are not an options since I cannot refund money that isn't mine. I also make it very clear to user B there is no promise that user A will actually fill the request.   


That all being said, I'd like to have actual meaningful terms/conditions and proper protection so if there are any disputes, I have ways to show that all the conditions were made available before purchase.

**5. BE A PROBLEM SOLVER**

I got this tip from James Altucher’s book Choose Yourself. If you can solve problems then you will likely go very far in life. To me life seems like a continuous set of problems that we have to overcome in order to move up to the next level. Just like in a video game, you can’t move up to the next level until you have figured out how the current level works. That is just like life.
But aren’t some people better than others at solving problems? And aren’t those the people that get ahead? Well, there may be some truth in this, but even if you’re not a great problem solver you can make yourself one.
In James Altucher’s book he suggests coming up with 10 ideas every day for the next six months. Just like going to the gym will build your physical muscles, coming up with 10 ideas a idea will build up your idea muscle or problem solving muscle.
If you have a problem in life but don’t know how to fix it, it’s likely because you’re just not used to solving problems. Maybe you can come up with one or two solutions that aren’t great and then you give up. The idea behind coming up with 10 ideas a day is that you get used to thinking about these things, so when you actually need to solve a real problem you’ll be much more effective.
Many people don’t have enough money and that can be a big problem for them. But why don’t they come up a solution to earn more? Well, probably they did think of a couple of ways but they weren’t really effective. They then probably gave up and accepted the fact that they will never have enough money. I was in this situation myself and over time have come up with over 100 ways to make extra money and I use many of them today.
So, for the next six months, write down 10 ideas every day on a specific topic. The first few ideas will likely be easy, but then you’ll really have to think hard in order to come up with 10. That is the part that pushes you to think up novel solutions. And that is what gets you good at problem solving. The ideas can be on anything. For example, 10 ideas to make $100 extra next month, 10 ideas to have a better sex life, 10 ideas to fit more exercise into your day. It doesn’t really matter what you choose, as it’s the coming up with the 10 ideas that counts. It doesn’t matter if some of these ideas are silly or not, but they should be at least somewhat practical. You don’t have to act on the ideas.

TL;DR: [LeetHub](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/leethub) is a free chrome extension that automatically pushes your code to GitHub when solving any Leetcode problem!

I just wanted to share a chrome extension I built in the past 2 days that legit could've been SOO helpful this recruiting season. As someone who's received multiple Fortune 100 SWE internship offers, having a good developer portfolio is vital for getting that interview. Recruiters \*actually\* check out your GitHub profile.

But instead of building random side-projects that may or may not help you prepare for your coding interviews, why not just practice on your algorithms &amp; data structures, whilst at the same time improve your dev portfolio?

This is what led me to LeetHub to enable students to just focus on improving their algorithms skills &amp; let this extension take care of improving your portfolio!

If you find it useful (or not), I'd appreciate some feedback on ProductHunt.

The E-Myth Revisited
By Michael E Gerber 
 
 
 
 
The Book’s Main Idea 
 
 
The E-Myth: “If you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. This is not true.”
 
 
 
 
A look at the main ideas shared in the book
 
 
The book uses various principles to define with clarity the differences between an entrepreneurial mindset and a business owner mindset. An entrepreneur sets up a system dependent business while a business owner sets up a people dependent business—a business dependent on him or her. 
 
 
 “If your business depends on you, you don’t own a business—you have a job. And it’s the worst job in the world because you’re working for a lunatic!”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
 
 
1: The Turnkey revolution
 
 
“Contrary to popular belief, my experience has shown me that the people who are exceptionally good in business aren't so because of what they know but because of their insatiable need to know more.”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
80% of all small businesses fail because they are the brainchildren of technically skilled people who believe because they have the technical skills, they “understand a business that does that technical work,” the very definition of the E-Myth.
 
 
What can you do to ensure you are setting up your business in a way that ensures its success? That is where turnkey revolution comes in.
 
 
The term means setting up your business processes and systems to ensure they are system-centric instead of people-centric. When your business systems and processes are effective, orderly, and consistent, your business works well and is likely to achieve success because the business is system-dependent instead of people dependent. 
 
 
“The Entrepreneurial Model has less to do with what’s done in a business and more to do with how it’s done. The commodity isn’t what’s important—the way it’s delivered is.”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
How do you set up your business in a way that ensures its operations are optimal? Gerber offers the following suggestions: document all processes—product creation, testing, marketing, sales, fulfillment, bookkeeping, etc. When you do this, you give your business that “franchise edge,” where because the business is systems centric—instead of people centric—you can effectively eliminate yourself from the business—essentially turn the business over to other people and still achieve massive success.
 
 
“With no clear picture of how you wish your life to be, how on earth are you going to live it? What is your Primary Aim? Where is the script to make your dreams come true? What is the first step to take and how do you measure your progress? How far have you gone and how close are you to getting to your goals?”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
The best way to create such a system is to determine your aim, the life you want to live as a business owner/entrepreneur, and then from that, create a beginning-to-end system that illustrates every stage of the business, how to solve arising problems, and how to create value for all involved. Define the systems you put in place so explicitly that someone with the lowest skill level can operate any area of the business. 
 
 
 
 
2: How to create a small business that succeeds 
 
 
“Everybody who goes into business is actually three-people-in-one: The Entrepreneur, The Manager, and The Technician.”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
To create a successful small business or business solution, you have to play three key roles: you have to be the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.
 
 
Entrepreneur: The role of the entrepreneur is to be visionary: to think ahead, and plan:
 
 
“…The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He’s happiest when left free to construct images of ‘what-if’ and ‘if-when…” “…The Entrepreneur is the innovator, the grand strategist, the creator of new methods for penetrating or creating new markets….”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
Manager: The manager is responsible for ensuring the business or workplace has a productive order. His role is to ensure the turnkey systems in place are consistently productive: 
 
 
“…The Manager is pragmatic. Without him, there would be no planning, no order, no predictability….” “…It is the tension between The Entrepreneur’s vision and The Manager’s pragmatism that creates the synthesis from which all great works are born…”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
Technician: The technician is the person responsible for doing the technical work:
 
 
“To The Technician, all ideas need to be reduced to methodology if they are to be of any value.”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
Unfortunately, and according to the E-myth, many entrepreneurs are small business owners who started a business because they had skilled, technical knowledge. 
 
 
“The typical small business owner is only 10 percent Entrepreneur, 20 percent Manager, and 70 percent Technician.”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
Technical knowledge alone is not enough because it enslaves you to your business. To be a good business owner, even as you work on the technical bits of the business in the beginning—creating systems—you must also be equal parts manager and entrepreneur. 
 
 
“Once you recognize that the purpose of your life is not to serve your business, but that the primary purpose of your business is to serve your life, you can then go to work on your business, rather than in it, with a full understanding of why it is absolutely necessary for you to do so.”
Michael E. Gerber
 
 
 
I hope that was useful, have a great day!

Gerber offers the following suggestions: document all processes—product creation, testing, marketing, sales, fulfillment, bookkeeping, etc. When you do this, you give your business that “franchise edge,” where because the business is systems centric—instead of people centric—you can effectively eliminate yourself from the business—essentially turn the business over to other people and still achieve massive success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With no clear picture of how you wish your life to be, how on earth are you going to live it? What is your Primary Aim? Where is the script to make your dreams come true? What is the first step to take and how do you measure your progress? How far have you gone and how close are you to getting to your goals?”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to create such a system is to determine your aim, the life you want to live as a business owner/entrepreneur, and then from that, create a beginning-to-end system that illustrates every stage of the business, how to solve arising problems, and how to create value for all involved. Define the systems you put in place so explicitly that someone with the lowest skill level can operate any area of the business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: How to create a small business that succeeds &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everybody who goes into business is actually three-people-in-one: The Entrepreneur, The Manager, and The Technician.”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a successful small business or business solution, you have to play three key roles: you have to be the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur: The role of the entrepreneur is to be visionary: to think ahead, and plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He’s happiest when left free to construct images of ‘what-if’ and ‘if-when…” “…The Entrepreneur is the innovator, the grand strategist, the creator of new methods for penetrating or creating new markets….”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manager: The manager is responsible for ensuring the business or workplace has a productive order. His role is to ensure the turnkey systems in place are consistently productive: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…The Manager is pragmatic. Without him, there would be no planning, no order, no predictability….” “…It is the tension between The Entrepreneur’s vision and The Manager’s pragmatism that creates the synthesis from which all great works are born…”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technician: The technician is the person responsible for doing the technical work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To The Technician, all ideas need to be reduced to methodology if they are to be of any value.”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, and according to the E-myth, many entrepreneurs are small business owners who started a business because they had skilled, technical knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The typical small business owner is only 10 percent Entrepreneur, 20 percent Manager, and 70 percent Technician.”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical knowledge alone is not enough because it enslaves you to your business. To be a good business owner, even as you work on the technical bits of the business in the beginning—creating systems—you must also be equal parts manager and entrepreneur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Once you recognize that the purpose of your life is not to serve your business, but that the primary purpose of your business is to serve your life, you can then go to work on your business, rather than in it, with a full understanding of why it is absolutely necessary for you to do so.”
Michael E. Gerber&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that was useful, have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hey, this is going to be a long post but it will be worth it!

If you are new in entrepreneurship, you must be having what you should do to grow and make a living out of it! Well I have 6 years of entrepreneurship experience and I would like to share what I have learned the hard way! 

1) Sales - Yes, no matter what you are capable of or what your product can do! You have to be the highest revenue generating person in your team! It being huge confidence in you to run business! Secondly as cashflow is positive you can grow quite easily! 

But I'm a product guy, or I'm an introvert! It is ok, but you have to learn the skill of selling because in the end of the day you are selling to human beings! Even if you are a introvert, you only like people who respect you as a human being and they give you your space! Or you buy products and services who gives you the best smile! Because that is how human beings are made!

2) Team - People leave because they are not valued! People do want to make money but majority of them want to feel what they are doing! They want to take responsibilities! And good people stick with you, no matter what the situation is! 

If you feel people only work for money, just understand a fact, there are 2 kind of people, one who only work for money and another who need money to pay bills but they want to make an impact or feel like they are part of something!

3) Hiring - In early stage of your business, Never hire a person who has everything sorted for him / her! Like their parents can take care of them when they are out of job! 

I can explain this with a very simple example, have you ever seen a lion inside a zoo? He is fed by the zookeeper, he forgets his skills and stops thinking about his hunting skill! Gets lazy because he knows he'll get food in a day or two, but a lion in jungle never forgets that he need food for survival! So he doesn't miss a chance to kill and that is why he is the king of jungle! 

4) Scale - Growing big is ok, but at what cost? Growimg big in stable or linear fashion is the right thing! Abnormal growth hurts everyone and I believe only lucky people are able to get that kind of growth for rest of us, it has to be one step at a time! 

5) I want a business without too much involvement - have you seen a doctor doing heart surgery as a side hustle and on day he is a corporate lawyer? Exactly, side hustle culture is too good to be true, if you want to step in a business world, only step if you can do that business 24 X 7 for rest of your life! Don't create something like a 2 year or 3 year! Because time is not going to stop and whatever you built is going to vanish!

6) Stress will be part of your life, there is no running away from it! You can only balance the stress with proper work life balance! And if you need relief, visit nearest community center, help people with something you can but they cannot! Like old age home! This will help you remove the stress from your body!

7) Delegation - Your only role is business is to get things done, but the only rule is! You are not allowed to lift a pen! Yes this sounds impossible but have you seen a president cleaning road? 

What I mean, delegate as much as you can, be their problem solver! Trust your subordinates, they have brain too! 

8) Documentation - Never give or take an instruction in verbal format, document everything! It sounds very ""slow"" and ""corporate culture of put me in cc"" but there is a reason for it! Your brain is too important to remember a small things! 

9) Transparency - If you have partners, keep everything transparent, do lie and don't hide things! Because if you do, it is going to break the tread of trust which is going to break your partnership or create a mess which you won't be able to solve! 

But, I don't know if I can trust them! Then leave them! Sounds harsh but it is better to have mad friends then angry enemies 

10) Take a salary home - one of the business man asked me how much salary I'm taking? I said right now nothing! He replied ""if you are not happy at home, you are not happy at work"" 

These are few lessons I learned my entrepreneurship journey!

,Entrepreneur,"I just want to state the original purpose of the term start-up because people on this sub abuse it.

A start up is business where the product, service and/or business model aren't clear at first.

I saw someone mention they are in a lawn care start-up. If you are taking care of lawns in some new novel way, THAT'S a start-up. 

If you are simply a landscaping business, that's NOT a start-up. That's just a new small business. 

Your service and product are clear. Your industry and customers are well defined. 

Start-ups, at least originally, got that name to highlight the added uncertainty of starting a business while figuring out if that business is even viable. They have much higher rates of failure than typical businesses.

On the flip side, because start-ups are in uncharted territory, they also have a much higher chance of monopolizing a market before anyone realizes what they are doing. Meaning far greater returns. 

This is why VC investors prefer to drop millions into a start-up and not a typical small business because the potential reward is significantly larger. 

This is why start-ups tend to go public or get acquired, because you need a lot of money to figure out that business model and those investors want a return on what they've given. 

This is also why banks usually won't touch start-ups at first, because banks have to stick to sure bets with loans and require you to have proven that you definitely can pay them back. 

Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with just starting a business that isn't a start-up. No, it's not as sexy, there won't be many articles written about your lawn care business, and it probably won't get acquired millions, but small businesses are just as important, if not more important than start-ups. Small businesses are the true drivers of the economy.

Edit: I did not realize this was such a controversial view. 

What you call your business can determine how customers, investors, etc frame your business.

Startups are more likely to get large amounts of funding because of the uncertainty.

Non start-ups are more likely to get traditional funding due to less uncertainty.

Customers will more likely be early adopters of start-ups and will wait for you to ""figure things out"". They won't do that for something like landscaping or car repair because those aren't start ups and they are expected to already operate at a certain level.

A lot of people ""feel"" that certain terms mean certain things, which is fine. But new entrepreneurs should, at the very least, be aware of how the gatekeepers (investors, customers) see this distinction.


Source: I've worked with startups for about 10 years, one which was acquired, one that went public. I've made a lot of money, but not enough to retire. I'm working on one now that I hope pays off enough for me to not have to work again.",t2_3wz478ks,False,,0,False,The Difference Between A Start-up and a Small Business,[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jyuee7,False,dark,0.88,,public,34,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,34,,False,,1606064659.0,,[],{},,True,,1606074331.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to state the original purpose of the term start-up because people on this sub abuse it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A start up is business where the product, service and/or business model aren&amp;#39;t clear at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw someone mention they are in a lawn care start-up. If you are taking care of lawns in some new novel way, THAT&amp;#39;S a start-up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are simply a landscaping business, that&amp;#39;s NOT a start-up. That&amp;#39;s just a new small business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your service and product are clear. Your industry and customers are well defined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start-ups, at least originally, got that name to highlight the added uncertainty of starting a business while figuring out if that business is even viable. They have much higher rates of failure than typical businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, because start-ups are in uncharted territory, they also have a much higher chance of monopolizing a market before anyone realizes what they are doing. Meaning far greater returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why VC investors prefer to drop millions into a start-up and not a typical small business because the potential reward is significantly larger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why start-ups tend to go public or get acquired, because you need a lot of money to figure out that business model and those investors want a return on what they&amp;#39;ve given. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why banks usually won&amp;#39;t touch start-ups at first, because banks have to stick to sure bets with loans and require you to have proven that you definitely can pay them back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with just starting a business that isn&amp;#39;t a start-up. No, it&amp;#39;s not as sexy, there won&amp;#39;t be many articles written about your lawn care business, and it probably won&amp;#39;t get acquired millions, but small businesses are just as important, if not more important than start-ups. Small businesses are the true drivers of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, before anyone wastes their time pointing out one of two examples that don&amp;#39;t fit nicely into these categories, I&amp;#39;ll just say I know they exist. Exceptions make the rule. I just hope this gives some people insight as they explore entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

Its seems more and more lately i see terrible products, that solve no problems, that founders wonder why they fail, or cant improve revenue. How do we avoid pursing a bad idea?     
  

First off, id like to say that literally anything in todays world can be sold, and be profitable. Bath water, snow, desert sand, shit shaped cupcakes, human hair, etc the list goes on. Even these products solve a problem but only for a small market or select group of people. At first glance the business is not sustainable, so lets try to avoid products like this and focus on a more wide-spread issue.     
 

 99% of all ""products"" ever created where meant to solve one single problem. Time. One of the only things we as humans cannot govern. From the earliest civilizations to this very day almost everything we have done is to gain more time.  

It can be split into two categories. 

Ability to buy time:   

This can be simple like using a horse and buggy to travel rather then by foot, or using a car, plane.   Using a mobile phone vs a landline. Faster internet, electricity, roads, city buildings, sewers, etc.   These products directly give us more time. At a cost but allowing us to use that time to do other things 

Improving existing time: 

These are like luxuries, chocolate, expensive cloths, nice house, vacations. In all these 'products' we still lose time, but it is improved while spent. Again, comes at a cost.     
  

In short, money evolved to allow us as individuals to ""purchase time"". Everyone is given a base starting point upon birth, and you choose what happens after that. You trade the resource TIME, for MONEY, and use it to buy more TIME.     
  

Think of all the great notable advancements throughout history, i can assure you each one was a significant improvement on time spent vs the next alternative at that time. It still continues to this day. People are different, but we are all at the core governed by the same thing. Most moves and thoughts we make will be towards the same final goal as the person next to us.

I don&amp;#39;t actually have much hope for it. I&amp;#39;m more run by my passion to work hard until it&amp;#39;s successful despite how long it may take. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think it&amp;#39;s a good idea to start dropshipping as a way into the whole buisness aspect of things or should I go a different route? Or do you have any advice for me at all? Anything is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone,

I asked this on Facebook to friends and family and no response (shocker) but I wanted to see if this idea was worth looking into. 

There's an app that lets you send messages to other people by using their license plate number. 
This is a base of something I was looking to build but with more features. 

I got the idea while driving from NY to FL. My U-Haul had a flat, but I didn't feel it because it was on the tow tire. 
1 guy was able to get my attention, but I'm sure many others tried or kept driving while thinking they should have done something. 

Would anyone find an app that you can talk to people through license plate numbers appealing? I would work on the privacy and it would initially be focused towards helping others, when we can't stop to help. 

This is the link to the app that's already created.

,Entrepreneur,"I thought I'd jot down a few thoughts about a topic that has been on my mind lately after hearing a lot of entrepreneurs and freelancers complaining about low social media engagement, increased monetization of platforms etc. 

When you're trying to start a business we always put so much energy into our digital footprint. You've got your squarespace website, your social media platforms, your mailchimp and too many of us are guilty of setting these up and complaining when the sales dont roll in. 

However, we're forgetting that the physical, analogue world still exists and always will do. Too many entrepreneurs ignore this, and it's creating huge opportunities for innovative traditional marketing and relationship building. As a space it just isnt being addressed anymore as people throw all their time and resources online. This is a huge mistake in my eyes. 

People buy things and do business with people they know and trust. Its just how things work. There is no better way than getting out into your community and talking to people about your business, showing them and demonstrating your product and looking locally rather than globally. 

Think about it, how many of your product are there on Amazon or when you search Google? Its like trying to sell sand in the desert, survivor bias means some will succeed, but most will be lost wasting energy.

Now think about how many people are going door to door locally pushing your product or service? How many people are setting up stands at local events or shopping areas and enthusiastically demonstrating and chatting to potential customers? The reality is local competition for most businesses probably sucks, its stale, run by people who are comfortable and bored, innovation is non existent.

,Entrepreneur,"Setting the right price is a pretty difficult task. All you can do is just set a random price. You can guess, or follow your greed and fall off the business. 

Here is a good example: 
In 2011, Netflix implemented a 60% price increase. As a result, 800,000 users cancelled their service. It was painful. 

Nobody wants to repeat this mistake. But, who is insured against such errors? All you have to do is guess and take a risk like a real beast. Right? 

Wrong. 

You can avoid these errors. Here is how. You need to perform a price A/B testing on a small group of your audience. After that, knowing for sure what will happen after you change your pricing, you can announce a new price to your entire audience. The other pitfall here is that, without price A/B testing, you will never know whether your current price brings you the biggest revenue or not. 

Here is an example: 
Brian Harris from Videofruit planned to sell his product for $97, but decided to A/B test his pricing before the public launch. Here is how: 

1. He sent the $97 price to the first 50 subscribers. They bought the product. 
2. Then, he sent a $197 price to next 50. They also purchased the product. 

He continued to increase his price until he found which figure generated the greatest revenue. He ended up with the price: $1200, which is more than 12 times higher than his initial guess.

The obvious next questions are

* Which features should the product include in its first version?

Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.

Before jumping into MLP, let's first understand what MVP is and why it's not enough in today's times.

# What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?

Eric Ries popularized the term minimum viable product in his book The Lean Startup as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.

**When MVP still works**

MVP is not dead though. It still works, given the right kind of problem statements.

Suppose you're building something that simply doesn't exist in the world, and it's something that people really want and have no alternative to getting it except from you.

At this time, people will accept a textbook MVP, simply because they have no frame of reference to compare it with. Or better yet, because they have no alternative to replace your MVP with.

**Why MVP is not enough in 2021**

Over the past few years as smartphone penetration boomed, products matured, product design and user experience matured, people's expectations have increased.

No longer does a quickly thrown together prototype cut it. People expect a minimum level of good UX and ease-of-use, else they'll leave your app before even giving it a proper try.

In fact, in 2021 great UX might be one strong reason people pick your product over incumbents. That's what happened with Transistorfm, who made podcast hosting simple and easy.

People expect good aesthetics that make a first impression, simply because that's what they have become used to from the plethora of beautiful and well-designed apps out there in the world.

People expect products to be fully functional as advertised. Buggy products are not acceptable, and in fact people might quickly take to Twitter or social media to let others know that a product is unreliable.

The MVP mindset intensely focuses on building the bare minimum, and that often leaves users frustrated and drives them to seek alternative solutions. Stiffer competition means that people WILL compare your product to alternatives in the market, it's inevitable. And unless you provide something unique and valuable that nobody else does, people are likely to leave.

All these reasons and more make MVP a dated concept, especially in the context of SaaS products. But above all, I think the MVP mindset makes product builders think too heavily about the ""minimum"" and often so at the cost of ""viable"".

That's a common pitfall and to avoid that, I propose the MLP framework.

# What is a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP)?

A great new concept that I've fallen in love with and personally follow in every product I build is MLP, or Minimum Loveable Product.

The term MLP was first coined by Brian de Haaff, the co-founder of Aha!, in his book Lovability.

Its definition is an extension of what Eric Ries already introduced to the world with MVP. With MLP though, you are trying to build the minimum ""loveable"" product, with a focus on no matter how small or feature-stripped the first version of your product is, it is sufficient to deliver a delightful experience to your user.

**Minimum Viable Product and the burnt pizza analogy**

Jiaona Zhang, who is currently VP of Product at Webflow (this blog is built using Webflow) introduced the burnt pizza analogy to her students at Stanford.

*“Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.""*

A great practical example of Minimum Loveable Product is the Apple iPad. All the tablets that came before Apple's tablet were MVPs.

# MLP vs MVP

If you're new to all these terminologies, I understand that it can be confusing. Bear with me, you'll wrap your head around it soon enough.

Build an MLP when you are solving a problem that's already understood by people, and an MVP when people don't easily understand a problem.

Build an MLP when you can clearly define and understand a market and you are trying to stand out from the existing tools. Build an MVP when you're trying to gauge if there even exists a market to serve.

An MLP can be built when you know exactly what customers want. An MVP is when you don't know what customers want, and therefore you want to throw things at the wall as quickly as possible and see what sticks.

An MLP is necessary if you are building in a market where several large and well-known alternatives already exist. An MVP is the right approach for a new market with barely any alternatives, or those solutions are not yet known by the masses.

While building an MLP, you make a dedicated effort to succeed with that idea. With MVP, you are trying to determine quickly whether the idea can succeed or whether it will fail.

Building an MVP means you're ready for failure and also ready to pivot quickly as you learn more about the market. Which means you should make tech and architecture decisions that help you move fast above anything else. Scalability or good architecture design is a concern to pay attention to while building an MLP.

Finally, the end goal of an MLP is that the customers who use it find it sufficient in functionality and experience to be able to ""love"" it. With an MLP, you're building just enough that a customer with (hopefully) a real pain point would ""tolerate"" and continue using your product while you validate your assumptions.

# Minimum Marketable Product, Minimum Remarkable Product, Minimum Launchable Product

The what?

I know, I know. I came across these terms for the first time today while researching to write this post. And I went through the literature so that I can tell you to safely ignore it.

If you understand and embody the concept of MLP, you don't need to think about any other frameworks or terminologies that you may discover while researching on Google.

# How to build an MLP for your Micro SaaS idea

Alright, let's put aside theory and dive right in.

Here are the steps you should loosely follow to building an MLP.

**1. Understand the #1 problem you're trying to solve**

What's the #1 reason someone would want to use your SaaS product over existing alternatives?

Is it that existing options have poor UX? Great, create a well designed and easy-to-use product. You'd be surprised to know how often people switch to an easier to use tool, simply because they are fed up of the poor UX that they encounter repeatedly.

Is it that existing alternatives are very expensive? Carve out a minimum set of features that people are paying a lot of money for and charge 1/10th for your v1 product. This might not work for very large customers, but vast majority of customers who are small or mid-sized are always looking for affordable alternatives.

It might not just be raw quantum of pricing, but certain companies targeting Enterprise customers have very complicated pricing slabs and tiers that are designed to give their sales person more room. In such a case, coming out with a competitor product which has a simple, easy-to-understand pricing is how you attract customers.

Are existing alternatives lacking certain features that leaves a subset of users very dissatisfied? Great, your MLP should specifically address that problem by building functionality that attracts these dissatisfied users. Side note - This is perhaps one of the best ways to go about building a new product.

In all cases, it involves understanding the problem you are solving and the exact reason why someone would use your product.

**2. Design a simple product that solves the top customer needs satisfactorily**

Once you have identified the #1 reason, it's time to decide on a feature set for your product that solves your customer's top pain points satisfactorily.

Let's take an example - People want to add a feedback tracking tool inside their product, so that they can collect user feedback automatically. However, the existing solutions don't allow them to embed the feedback tracker within their tool.

That's your entry point into providing value that customers seek, but are not getting as of today.

Having understood the #1 problem, you also have to understand other requirements that fall under the ""minimum"" set of things you need to do to build a ""loveable"" product.

These could be:

* existing solutions are all well designed and aesthetically pleasing =&gt; your minimum loveable product needs to be well designed too
* existing solutions are affordably priced with a easy to understand pricing structure =&gt; your MLP also needs a simple pricing structure that's affordable

In general, you want to analyze your competitors and understand

1. What they are doing well
2. What users value from among those things

In your MLP, you need to cover the intersection of (what they are doing well) x (what users value from among those).

**3. Set a short timeline for building your MLP**

No matter what you build, building in isolation for too long is dangerous. The main reason for that is - you get to know too late whether your assumptions about what the user really values are on point or off course.

*""But Preetam, you just told me to build a Minimum Loveable Product. And now you're saying I got to build it quickly?""*

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

Short timeframe depends on what you are building, and the size of your team.

For example - with SuperLemon (WhatsApp plugin for Shopify), Sankalp and I built a MLP in 2 weeks time.

How?

We identified precisely the way we could do better - build an easy to setup app, and design beautiful looking widgets that blend in with your store.

The minimum set of features required were - the ability to configure the text within the chat button (eg. ""Chat with us""), and the option to select between 4 different design and colour options based on the user's preference of having a large button or a small one.

That's it! That was our MLP and we grew it to 2,000 users in 40 days before we added a new set of significant features to the app.

""My product is more complicated than that! I can't build an MLP in 2 weeks.""

That's okay! I totally understand.

With [DelightChat](https://www.delightchat.io), which is customer support software for ecommerce stores, we are taking a significantly longer duration to build our MLP than we did with SuperLemon. A little over 3 months, to be exact.

Let's set the record straight - I'm uncomfortable with long development timelines. But in this scenario, it can't be helped.

We need to do it this way because the product is complex and needs time for development. And also because building anything lesser than the MLP we have designed would not appeal sufficiently to ecommerce merchants to use DelightChat over existing alternatives.

But most importantly, and it would be misleading if I didn't disclose this, we have the runway in terms of monetary capital to afford 3 months of product building. And hence we can afford to take the time.

But even then, we are

* focusing deeply on the core UX, functionality and value proposition that will draw the initial set of users in, and delight them
* ruthlessly prioritizing features that can be built later, that are not dealbreakers for the initial userbase

And that's precisely what you need to do as well.

If this post managed to get through to you, then you now have the required framework and understanding to build an MLP version of your micro-SaaS product.

&lt;p&gt;The obvious next questions are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which features should the product include in its first version?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long should you take to build it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this post, I provide you with a framework to identify your initial product features, how to decide what to include or exclude from the first versions, and continue building upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into MLP, let&amp;#39;s first understand what MVP is and why it&amp;#39;s not enough in today&amp;#39;s times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Ries popularized the term minimum viable product in his book The Lean Startup as that version of a new product that is just usable enough by early customers who can then provide feedback to the team. This feedback should help the team generate validated learnings and guide them on future product development and features.&lt;/p&gt;

[Optimizing landing pages for conversion ](https://youtu.be/KO5Yi7lvNkU)

Too lazy to watch the video? Read the summary 

1) Adding Count Down Timers - when you add count down timers, it creates a sense of urgency! People feel they are going to miss out the deal! Big companies do all the time, like last sale and stuff!

2) Less Form Fields - Every hate filling forms, and people are very very suspicious of filling out an extra field, why you need my phone number, why you need my blood group? Unless it is required, keep it minimum to email address!

3) Pre Filled Forms - you are upselling something, there is no need to get their details again if you already have them! It sounds very cliché but people don't do that! Pre fill them!

4) Dynamic Text - Instead of ""hey, we made this for you"" make the text look like ""Hey, John! We made this product for you""

5) Retargeting - Retrageting is like warming up the leads, if a person already clicked on your ads, chances of him getting converted will increase instead of a person who is new to your brand!

6) Exit Popup - If a person is going away(closing tab), show them exit popup! Give them something to sign up for, like discount! And offer or even a free ebook for reading!

7) Reviews - Yes, after your killer product pitch, show them reviews of other users! Show them that there are users who are using your product and what they feel about it!

8) Demo Video - This is by far the best, show the problem the current user is facing and after that show the solution you are offering! It will help you convert better more than any other thing!

&lt;p&gt;1) Adding Count Down Timers - when you add count down timers, it creates a sense of urgency! People feel they are going to miss out the deal! Big companies do all the time, like last sale and stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Less Form Fields - Every hate filling forms, and people are very very suspicious of filling out an extra field, why you need my phone number, why you need my blood group? Unless it is required, keep it minimum to email address!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Pre Filled Forms - you are upselling something, there is no need to get their details again if you already have them! It sounds very cliché but people don&amp;#39;t do that! Pre fill them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Dynamic Text - Instead of &amp;quot;hey, we made this for you&amp;quot; make the text look like &amp;quot;Hey, John! We made this product for you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Retargeting - Retrageting is like warming up the leads, if a person already clicked on your ads, chances of him getting converted will increase instead of a person who is new to your brand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Exit Popup - If a person is going away(closing tab), show them exit popup! Give them something to sign up for, like discount! And offer or even a free ebook for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Reviews - Yes, after your killer product pitch, show them reviews of other users! Show them that there are users who are using your product and what they feel about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Demo Video - This is by far the best, show the problem the current user is facing and after that show the solution you are offering! It will help you convert better more than any other thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need visuals, please go though the video!&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur," 

I know I know, you are probably used to reading happy ending stories about entrepreneurs who tried, failed, tried again, and eventually raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Sorry, this is not one of them, not yet anyway, I'm still trying :)

I Apologize for any phrasing/spelling issues but I think it will be worth reading it

I started my entrepreneur's journey somewhere in 2015, at first I was only working on my venture during the weekend as I still had a day job. The big break came 2 years later when I was introduced to a hedge fund guy who was interested in what I was working on. To cut a long story short 6 months later I was finally a full-time entrepreneur who raised its first pre-seed funding ($1.5M). The catch was he gave me the idea and I was in charge of executing it, at the time it didn't look like a big deal because the guy was obviously successful and knew what he was doing.

Over the next 2 years, I was: building a platform, flying to meetings, negotiating, creating new partnerships, burning money, and feeling pretty important. But every time someone asked me what I was doing I felt two things, first I didn't have a good answer to stick to, and second, most people didn't understand what I told them.

In the end, after two years of hard work and a lot of money our solution was almost ready, and my partners/investors told me it's time to find new clients. Although I knew perfectly this day is coming I was still in shock when I was told it's my responsibility to do so. I found myself rushing to build a deck and trying to convince companies to pay for something we never checked in the first place if they even want.

Lesson number one:

Although I do not regret the journey, it could have been much more empowering and efficient if I had started with the problem and not the solution, or as they say a solution in search of a problem. Don't be afraid to ask the hard questions especially the ones you don't know the answer to, listen to your inner voice in most cases it is right, and always confront your assumptions. If you won't do it now you will do it later!!!.

&amp;#x200B;

Second attempt:

Like any good entrepreneurship story, it starts in a bar (yes with a napkin). I was sitting with a friend who wanted to consult with me on what to do with his new fortunate he just inherited, pretty quickly we ended up with real estate. While we were talking about the best areas to buy an apartment, we suddenly realized we might have found a big problem without a good solution.

Armed with what I learned from lesson one, I immediately started researching online and talking to people about my new problem. When I couldn't find a solution online and most of the people I spoke to told me how smart I was, I decided it's a good time to speak to more believable people with actual experience in the field. I reached out to a friend of mine who owns a successful real estate development company, after the meeting he told me that he liked the idea and he wanted to join in. To be completely honest we spoke to a lot of people about the idea and even conducted an online survey, but most of the time we got a soft yes to the option of using the service, and not, I want it right now, as an answer.

So we kept investing time and money into the MVP hoping it will be a bit better and bigger so we could launch it. From here to there almost a year passed when we were finally ready to launch (two months into covid-19). We only managed to hold 3 meetups before covid forced us to freeze the launch as market conditions changed dramatically.

Lesson number two:

Launch as quickly as possible, there is a reason it's called MVP (a minimum viable product). How minimal? my rule of thumb is somewhere between 3 weeks and 3 months, any longer than that you are probably lying to yourself (unless you are building the next SpaceX). And do yourself a favor: speak directly to your potential customer and ask good questions, by that I mean, challenge your core assumptions.

&amp;#x200B;

Third attempt:

While I was still licking my wounds from the last two experiences and was adapting to live in the new normal with Covid-19. My mind starts in search of new broken things in the world (word of caution, following a trend, can be a short and risky ride). Pretty quickly I realized that WFH (Working from home) is not easy and a lot of people are suffering from the new reality. So this time I decided I will start talking to potential clients first (Lesson number 1) and once I have a better understanding of the problem I will launch quickly (Lesson number 2), so I started to test my assumption by talking to HR managers, COOs, CEOS, basically anyone I could find whom I believed was directly in charge of solving the problem (the champion) or will eventually need to approve the deal (the decision-maker). It's very important to ask open-end questions and even more important to listen (A.K.A ask good questions).

Once I felt I had enough good feedbacks, I decided to test the water, it took me about 1 month since I originally thought about the concept until I actually started to reach out to potential customers. Personally, I prefer B2B, I think it's easier to start with and the feedbacks are more reliable. Anyway pretty quickly I started to get responses and schedule intro calls with prospects (Even though it's harder it's better to listen than to talk). In the beginning, I was pretty happy with the results. I started seeing my pipeline growing by the day, especially when you take into account that the only thing I had was a deck and a financial model. It took me about another two months and almost 700 more cold emails to realize that my solution is not bringing enough value to the table, I think the PROs will call it fake traction.

Lesson number three:

I actually learned two lessons here, but I have to stick with the title. First, if you select a problem in a field you are not an expert in (low founder market fit) you will learn a lot on the way, so it's very important not to fall in love with your idea because most chances it will change. Second and more importantly when you do get some traction (Two companies did sign up) please make sure you didn't lose your main goal in the process, and you aren't getting yourself into something that can't grow quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope my experiences will help some of you to look at things differently, and if I’m lucky they might even save you some time along the way.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

I've started working with clients across various countries, and there are some common themes I've noticed with the type of creatives that work the best.

If you've got your targeting right (which is a tough job as well), I think this can help a lot of people, hopefully.
I've found a couple of things depending on various age groups:-

- 15-20:- This age group is much more likely to make a purchase if an influencer they know is shown in that ad, or if the ad has a relatable factor to it (based on various industries).
- 20-30:- If the ad shows a ""socially cool"" factor to using that product, they are much more likely to purchase. For ex:- If your wore this jacket, girls will get attracted to you (or something along those lines).
- 30-40:- This group is the most simple, yet difficult to crack to. They need a lot of social proof, a lot of re-targeting, a lot of talking about the ""benefits"" of the product, a lot of offers to purchase, etc.
- 40 and above:- If you show user-generated content to these people, they are much more likelier to make a purchase, especially if it's a child in the creative.

Obviously I'm generalizing a lot, but this is what I've seen work across all of my Indian, US and other International Clients. And testing is always a way to go, test multiple audiences, variables, copy, creative, different formats, etc... And see what works.

p.s:- It's no secret, but short-form videos work the best through-out the different awareness stages (sometimes long-form if the product is high ticket or the industry demands it).",t2_1uf9artg,False,,0,False,The creatives that work the best for different age groups!,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'How to Grow'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_jypbpz,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},How to Grow,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606047186.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to scale this even further, and eventually convert into an LLC, and hire employees. However, I JUST started. All of this is simply calculating, and even though I’m outsourcing basically everything and only doing order processing on my end, I still am worried this will flop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do, to make this easy idea, into a growing business? Is there anyone here with experience in this market?&lt;/p&gt;

My TikTok account recently exploded and I am seeing consistent significant growth every day.  

Coincidentally, I am seeing a huge growth in monthly followers on my YouTube channel, which I suspect is coming from TikTok (also have had confirmation from some TikTok followers that they have subsequently followed me on YT after coming across my TikTok account). 

However looking at YouTube analytics I don’t see any mention of TikTok in any of the external traffic sources. Anyone have any idea why? 

My biggest source of external traffic right now is "" sites.google ""... but as far as I know, TikTok is not affiliated with Google? I don’t know what else this could be as I don’t have a website and I’m not featured in any press or online articles etc.

Atomic Habits by James Clear
 
 
 
 
Success is habitual. If you have good, positive habits, your life/career trajectory will be good and no matter how long it takes, you will eventually achieve the positive results you want. 
 
 
 “All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.”
 
 
What is the best, most frictionless way to create good habits and break bad ones or replace them with good ones? 
 
 
James Clear’s bestselling book, Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones, discusses easy but highly effective habit formation strategies that will change your life. 
 
 
As James Clear aptly puts it:
 
 
 “Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.”
 
 
Atomic Habits by James Clear is a habit-changing manual that will show you how to create good habits and replace bad one with positive ones. The habit creation methods James Clear discuses are as efficient as they are methodical and the book is a beehive of actionable self-development golden nuggets.
 
 
In this book summary, we discuss the key lessons learned from reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, and more importantly, how you can implement these lessons in your life right now and start achieving the best results possible:
 
 
 
 
Lesson 1: Atomic habits are the secret to personal growth 
 
 
An atomic habit is a habit so small that you do not experience its positive effect in your daily life. Over time though, these “small” and seemingly nonconsequential habits compound and cast a substantial effect on your life experience. 
 
 
“the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.”
 
 
Whenever you are working towards adopting a specific habit—or towards breaking one—rather that concentrate on massive changes that require more willpower and motivation, concentrate instead on making smaller, gradual changes; concentrate on atomic habits and changes.
 
 
As an example, if you would like to develop the habit of exercising in the morning, instead of committing yourself to a full on 30 minutes jog on the first day, commit to walking around the block for 5-10 minutes and keep improving at a rate of 1%. Eventually, you will successfully create positive habits or break negative ones.  
 
 
“If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system/habits instead.”
 
 
How do you create atomic habits?
 
 
The best way to create small habits that stick is to concentrate on completing two minutes tasks/mini habits, and stacking smaller routines to create a larger routine. 
 
 
For instance, rather than focus on working for one hour uninterrupted, which requires a lot of motivation and willpower, concentrate instead on working in bouts of 5-10 minutes with 2-5 minute breaks within sprints. This will keep you motivated as you work towards developing the habit of being productive. 
 
 
When you create small habits 
 
 
 
 
Lesson 2: To create sticky habits, make them identity-based 
 
 
“With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.”
 
 
To create and adopt good habits that stick, concentrate on developing habits based on who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve. For instance, if you want to become healthy and lean, concentrate more on the person you will become—a healthy and lean person–and less on what you want to achieve. 
 
 
By focusing on the development of atomic habits that help you build your ideal identity, the person you want to become, the habit formation and breaking process becomes easier to implement. 
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
James Clear’s Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones, is a splendid book that will get you to rethink how you develop habits. 
 
 
 
 
I hope that was useful, have a great day!

&lt;p&gt;For instance, rather than focus on working for one hour uninterrupted, which requires a lot of motivation and willpower, concentrate instead on working in bouts of 5-10 minutes with 2-5 minute breaks within sprints. This will keep you motivated as you work towards developing the habit of being productive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you create small habits &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2: To create sticky habits, make them identity-based &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create and adopt good habits that stick, concentrate on developing habits based on who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve. For instance, if you want to become healthy and lean, concentrate more on the person you will become—a healthy and lean person–and less on what you want to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on the development of atomic habits that help you build your ideal identity, the person you want to become, the habit formation and breaking process becomes easier to implement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Clear’s Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones, is a splendid book that will get you to rethink how you develop habits. &lt;/p&gt;

But I see that all these subreddits have a rule of &amp;quot;no self promotion&amp;quot;, including this one. I&amp;#39;m a frequent reader of these subreddits, so I don&amp;#39;t want to get banned for breaking the rules. Other non-reddit communities (e.g. Forums) have similar no self-promotion rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: how do you validate your ideas with potential customers without making it look like spam or self-promotion?&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Who says you have to spend large amounts of budget to scale your marketing?

Companies like Trello acquired their first 500,000 users without spending a dime on marketing or advertising.

That’s what we call *bootstrapping*. 

Literally strapping up your boots, rolling up your sleeves, and doing everything by hand with existing resources.

Not only does this save on expenses and keeps a company lean, but it also gives you first-hand insight into what a good job looks like if you decide to outsource later.

Bootstrapping is also great for testing the waters. You may invest into some channels and campaigns but bootstrap others to see if they’re worthwhile.

Try out these powerful bootstrapping marketing ideas to see for yourself:

## 1. Build your audience with an email list

Imagine having a private audience you could tap into any time to promote content or services.

It would drive traffic and revenue in the snap of a finger.

Welcome to bootstrap email marketing.

Yes. It’s decades-old but still works like brand new. 

As a matter of fact, email marketing generates up to a 40x return on investment. Not too shabby, right?

The first step to build an email list is choosing an email marketing software. These include:

1. Mailchimp
2. HubSpot
3. Aweber
4. Active Campaign
5. Constant Contact

Try the free versions of these if they’re available to see if it suits your company. Then you can move onto the second step.

You, of course, need a way for users to opt-in to your email list. You can use popup, sidebar, or embedded forms to achieve this. 

Better yet, reel subscribers in with something called a *lead magnet*. This is a free resource that you offer in exchange for their information.

It significantly increases conversions while also allowing you to show authority, expertise, and promote your services.

Keep the 80/20 rule in mind with email marketing: 80% of newsletters should be informational and value-driven while the remaining 20% can be promotional.

That brings me to my next point.

## 2. Content marketing is a must

Not having content on a website in 2020 is like being a ghost town.

“Where are all the blogs?” your customers will think.

I’m not joking either. According to the Content Preferences Survey Report, 47% of consumers read up to 3–5 pieces of content before contacting a sales rep.

It makes sense.

Consumers want to perform their due diligence on a company to trust them before buying.

That’s where content bridges the gap.

Content comes in a million different forms too: blog posts, videos, podcasts, infographics, social posts, whitepapers, case studies; the list goes on.

The key is to choose a single channel and master it. Become the Tony Robbins of that content format.

Study what makes that type of content great, how to distribute it, and how to get users engaging. 

I suggest researching topics with a free tool like AnswerThePublic. Plug in a keyword and hit “Search.”

This will display questions, prepositions, and questions related to your query. 

Export these and share them with your team to begin fleshing out a content calendar.

## 3. Create a viral effect like Slack

Slack, the world’s most popular communication platform, grew with little to no marketing or advertising.

How did they do it?

By making one hell of a free product that people couldn’t resist using. They also encouraged users to invite others and get their team on the platform.

They are easily one of the best bootstrap marketing examples ever.

Okay. How can your business take a similar approach?

Firstly, consider offering a free version or trial of your platform. If you aren’t a SaaS business, it can be a free consultation, audit, or lead magnet.

The idea is to get people into your funnel. A.K.A get their foot in the door and have them tell others about their experience.

Most importantly, treat them like your one and only customer. America Express discovered that 7 out of 10 consumers spend more money with a company that delivers great service.

Optimize the heck out of the customer experience so much they can’t help but talk about it.

Consider offering an incentive for sharing your business with others such as affiliate commissions, extended trials, etc.

## 4. Find your 1,000 true fans

Seth Godin, the geeky marketer with funny glasses and author of 18 books like *This Is Marketing* doesn’t believe you should market to everyone.

That’s a surefire way to bore a lot of people and come off as generic. You need to have a distinct personality and please a very small group of customers.

That’s what Seth calls your *1,000 true fans*: a small group of buyers that love your product, rave about it, and become brand ambassadors. 

So, how can you find these people and delight them?

I recommend that you use an analytics segmenting tool such as:

* Google Analytics
* Hotjar
* Morphio
* HubSpot
* Marketo
* Etc.

These will collect website and customer profile data to organize into reports and sheets. From there, it’s time to start digging!

We’re looking for a hypersegment. A group so small you’ll need a magnifying glass to see them. (Not literally!)

I recommend that you break down the customer groups that are contributing the most to conversions, revenue, and your bottom line.

You can set up goals on Google Analytics and see what demographics are completing them the most for illustration.

Once you’ve discovered a profitable hypersegment, marketing campaigns, targeting, and messaging should be reworked to please this small group.

## Concluding bootstrap marketing

Having a bootstrap marketing plan is ideal for any agency looking to stay lean or make the best out of the current economic situation.

It’s making us realize that we need to be smarter with our money, investing, and business choices.

To recap, email marketing, content marketing, viral sharing, and customer segmenting are some of the strongest bootstrap marketing ideas you can deploy.

&lt;p&gt;That’s what we call &lt;em&gt;bootstrapping&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally strapping up your boots, rolling up your sleeves, and doing everything by hand with existing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does this save on expenses and keeps a company lean, but it also gives you first-hand insight into what a good job looks like if you decide to outsource later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping is also great for testing the waters. You may invest into some channels and campaigns but bootstrap others to see if they’re worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try out these powerful bootstrapping marketing ideas to see for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Build your audience with an email list&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine having a private audience you could tap into any time to promote content or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would drive traffic and revenue in the snap of a finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to bootstrap email marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. It’s decades-old but still works like brand new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, email marketing generates up to a 40x return on investment. Not too shabby, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step to build an email list is choosing an email marketing software. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HubSpot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aweber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active Campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try the free versions of these if they’re available to see if it suits your company. Then you can move onto the second step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, of course, need a way for users to opt-in to your email list. You can use popup, sidebar, or embedded forms to achieve this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, reel subscribers in with something called a &lt;em&gt;lead magnet&lt;/em&gt;. This is a free resource that you offer in exchange for their information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It significantly increases conversions while also allowing you to show authority, expertise, and promote your services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep the 80/20 rule in mind with email marketing: 80% of newsletters should be informational and value-driven while the remaining 20% can be promotional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to my next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Content marketing is a must&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not having content on a website in 2020 is like being a ghost town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Where are all the blogs?” your customers will think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not joking either. According to the Content Preferences Survey Report, 47% of consumers read up to 3–5 pieces of content before contacting a sales rep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers want to perform their due diligence on a company to trust them before buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where content bridges the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content comes in a million different forms too: blog posts, videos, podcasts, infographics, social posts, whitepapers, case studies; the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to choose a single channel and master it. Become the Tony Robbins of that content format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study what makes that type of content great, how to distribute it, and how to get users engaging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest researching topics with a free tool like AnswerThePublic. Plug in a keyword and hit “Search.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will display questions, prepositions, and questions related to your query. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export these and share them with your team to begin fleshing out a content calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Create a viral effect like Slack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack, the world’s most popular communication platform, grew with little to no marketing or advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did they do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making one hell of a free product that people couldn’t resist using. They also encouraged users to invite others and get their team on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are easily one of the best bootstrap marketing examples ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. How can your business take a similar approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, consider offering a free version or trial of your platform. If you aren’t a SaaS business, it can be a free consultation, audit, or lead magnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to get people into your funnel. A.K.A get their foot in the door and have them tell others about their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, treat them like your one and only customer. America Express discovered that 7 out of 10 consumers spend more money with a company that delivers great service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimize the heck out of the customer experience so much they can’t help but talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider offering an incentive for sharing your business with others such as affiliate commissions, extended trials, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Find your 1,000 true fans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin, the geeky marketer with funny glasses and author of 18 books like &lt;em&gt;This Is Marketing&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t believe you should market to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a surefire way to bore a lot of people and come off as generic. You need to have a distinct personality and please a very small group of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Seth calls your &lt;em&gt;1,000 true fans&lt;/em&gt;: a small group of buyers that love your product, rave about it, and become brand ambassadors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how can you find these people and delight them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend that you use an analytics segmenting tool such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotjar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morphio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HubSpot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will collect website and customer profile data to organize into reports and sheets. From there, it’s time to start digging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a hypersegment. A group so small you’ll need a magnifying glass to see them. (Not literally!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend that you break down the customer groups that are contributing the most to conversions, revenue, and your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up goals on Google Analytics and see what demographics are completing them the most for illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve discovered a profitable hypersegment, marketing campaigns, targeting, and messaging should be reworked to please this small group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Concluding bootstrap marketing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a bootstrap marketing plan is ideal for any agency looking to stay lean or make the best out of the current economic situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s making us realize that we need to be smarter with our money, investing, and business choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, email marketing, content marketing, viral sharing, and customer segmenting are some of the strongest bootstrap marketing ideas you can deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

Blink By Malcolm Gladwell 
 
 
 
 
When you pay attention to your intuition or what your gut is communicating, it becomes easier to make quick and effective decisions that can be, according to Malcom Gladwell’s Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, much more effective than decisions made after conscious deliberation. According to the author, “There can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.” 
 
 
 
 
The Premise Of The Book
 
 
Blink is about how to make intuitive, effective decisions, to listen to your gut and use it to make snap judgment calls all the while avoiding wrong assumptions.
 
 
“Blink” is about the moments when we know something without knowing why.”
 
 
In this book summary, we look at the main principles discussed in the book and more importantly, how you can apply these principles into your life right now to achieve amazing results immediately:
 
 
 
 
Lesson 1: Understand And Use The Power Of Intuition
 
 
One standout characteristic of being human is that we are capable of drawing accurate conclusions from small amounts of data; Malcolm Gladwell calls this thin-slice, our ability to combine small amounts of information with intuition and our experiences to make informed decisions.
 
 
“Anyone who has ever scanned the bookshelves of a new girlfriend or boyfriend – or peeked inside his or her medicine cabinet – understands this implicitly; you can learn as much – or more – from one glance at a private space as you can from hours of exposure to a public face.”
 
 
The concept of thin-slicing, using little information to make smart, intuitive decisions with minimal deliberation is a core principle Gladwell shares in the book.
 
 
Our subconscious mind is very intuitive and fast at filtering information. When presented with new information, the subconscious mind has the ability to sift through the information, toss out irrelevant and trivial factors, and rapidly analyze the main factors to present you with an intuitive decision. The subconscious mind has the ability to recognize connections and patterns long before the conscious mind does. 
 
 
“Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room, and we can’t look inside that room. Guided by experience a person can become expert.”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 2: Your Gut/Intuition Is Not Always Right  
 
 
While snap-second decisions tend to be more accurate than overanalyzed decisions–thanks to our subconscious ability to see patterns and relate them—they are not always correct. In some cases, untrained intuition can lead to stereotypes, prejudiced, and biased decisions. 
 
 
For example, because the subconscious mind connects patterns, when you get into a situation you have been in before, your subconscious mind can draw similarities from these experiences, thus leading to an ineffective decision. This makes experience and preconditioning very important aspects of intuitive decision-making.
 
 
“In the blink of an eye, a single expert can usually tell you more than a mountain of survey data.”
 
 
Some situations can also compromise your intuitive ability, the ability to make decisions in a blink. Take the example of high stress situations. When you are in a high stress situation, it compromises your ability to thin-slice through information–such as reading facial expressions. When this happens, your subconscious mind, the intuitive mind, focuses only on what it considers the most important, imminent bits of information. Often, concentrating on what it considers a threatening, imminent piece of information leads to prejudiced decisions. 
 
 
To ensure your intuition does not make prejudiced, snap-decisions, aim to minimize arousal. For instance, work to minimize stress so that the subconscious mind can recalibrate its internal filter and stop being on overdrive or concentrating on an impeding threat.
 
 
“Arousal leaves us mind-blind.”
 
 
Lesson 3: Calibrate Your Filter
 
 
At the center of our ability to make decisions in the blink of an eye is our subconscious mind’s ability to filter and relate information to and from our experiences. Stressful situations cause prejudiced intuition because they filter what information the subconscious mind considers important.
 
 
“[Research] suggests that what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act – and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment – are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.”
 
 
Other than stress, common experiences ingrained deeply in our subconscious mind can also jeopardize our intuitive ability. The best way to counter this is to create personal filters and screens that help ensure irrelevant information does not reach the subconscious mind in the first place. 
 
 
For instance, if you look into your life and notice areas where you make biased decisions, create screens and filters that reduce the amount of information reaching your subconscious mind—reduce the flow of information by up to 40%. It will significantly improve your intuition and decision making abilities.
 
 
“The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.”
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
Cultivate present mindfulness of yourself so that you can know when to trust your instincts–and use it to make intuitive, snap decisions—and when to give decisions deep conscious thought.  
 
 
 
I hope that was useful. Have a great day!

&lt;p&gt;Blink By Malcolm Gladwell &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you pay attention to your intuition or what your gut is communicating, it becomes easier to make quick and effective decisions that can be, according to Malcom Gladwell’s Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, much more effective than decisions made after conscious deliberation. According to the author, “There can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Premise Of The Book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blink is about how to make intuitive, effective decisions, to listen to your gut and use it to make snap judgment calls all the while avoiding wrong assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Blink” is about the moments when we know something without knowing why.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book summary, we look at the main principles discussed in the book and more importantly, how you can apply these principles into your life right now to achieve amazing results immediately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1: Understand And Use The Power Of Intuition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One standout characteristic of being human is that we are capable of drawing accurate conclusions from small amounts of data; Malcolm Gladwell calls this thin-slice, our ability to combine small amounts of information with intuition and our experiences to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anyone who has ever scanned the bookshelves of a new girlfriend or boyfriend – or peeked inside his or her medicine cabinet – understands this implicitly; you can learn as much – or more – from one glance at a private space as you can from hours of exposure to a public face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of thin-slicing, using little information to make smart, intuitive decisions with minimal deliberation is a core principle Gladwell shares in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our subconscious mind is very intuitive and fast at filtering information. When presented with new information, the subconscious mind has the ability to sift through the information, toss out irrelevant and trivial factors, and rapidly analyze the main factors to present you with an intuitive decision. The subconscious mind has the ability to recognize connections and patterns long before the conscious mind does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room, and we can’t look inside that room. Guided by experience a person can become expert.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2: Your Gut/Intuition Is Not Always Right  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While snap-second decisions tend to be more accurate than overanalyzed decisions–thanks to our subconscious ability to see patterns and relate them—they are not always correct. In some cases, untrained intuition can lead to stereotypes, prejudiced, and biased decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, because the subconscious mind connects patterns, when you get into a situation you have been in before, your subconscious mind can draw similarities from these experiences, thus leading to an ineffective decision. This makes experience and preconditioning very important aspects of intuitive decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the blink of an eye, a single expert can usually tell you more than a mountain of survey data.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some situations can also compromise your intuitive ability, the ability to make decisions in a blink. Take the example of high stress situations. When you are in a high stress situation, it compromises your ability to thin-slice through information–such as reading facial expressions. When this happens, your subconscious mind, the intuitive mind, focuses only on what it considers the most important, imminent bits of information. Often, concentrating on what it considers a threatening, imminent piece of information leads to prejudiced decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure your intuition does not make prejudiced, snap-decisions, aim to minimize arousal. For instance, work to minimize stress so that the subconscious mind can recalibrate its internal filter and stop being on overdrive or concentrating on an impeding threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arousal leaves us mind-blind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson 3: Calibrate Your Filter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of our ability to make decisions in the blink of an eye is our subconscious mind’s ability to filter and relate information to and from our experiences. Stressful situations cause prejudiced intuition because they filter what information the subconscious mind considers important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Research] suggests that what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act – and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment – are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than stress, common experiences ingrained deeply in our subconscious mind can also jeopardize our intuitive ability. The best way to counter this is to create personal filters and screens that help ensure irrelevant information does not reach the subconscious mind in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you look into your life and notice areas where you make biased decisions, create screens and filters that reduce the amount of information reaching your subconscious mind—reduce the flow of information by up to 40%. It will significantly improve your intuition and decision making abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultivate present mindfulness of yourself so that you can know when to trust your instincts–and use it to make intuitive, snap decisions—and when to give decisions deep conscious thought.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that was useful. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

After being frustrated with not being able to share and collaborate on links with friends and family, I created SeeLink, a platform to simplify sharing and collaborating on links with friends and family.  You can find it at [https://seelink.app](https://seelink.app/).

I've been running an asphalt company for 16 years. I recently took over, I own it with no partners. I have been running successfully for the last 2 years.

The times come that the guys that aren't dead have retired and there's 2 of us left.I was the youngest at 38 and I have 1 guy that is 74 that still works for me to ""get out of the house "" on occasion. i lost my best mate and my leading hand and head raker a year ago to lung cancer, and 3 more medical retirements. So now I'm doing the heavy lifting.
I'm at the yearly rush and I have more jobs to do than I can handle. I pay more than a fair wage %10 above and for the first time in 15 years of allocating im out of staff.

How would you source asphalt related labour 

How woul you find quality casual staff that would suit my situation.

Hours. 8 hours minimum but on busy weeks we can do 6 x 10 hours days. Penalty rates are x1.5 for any hours after 8 till 10 hours. Then its double time after that. Penalty rates on weekends. Work is up and down.

I'm trying to hire but the work is so spontaneous the only people that ever lasted were the people that could handle the spontaneous workload, 2 days this week, 4 days next week and we don't know what happens from there type thing.

I was wondering what the timeline of a successful entrepreneurial project timeline looks like. 

For projects with a more or less clear cut idea in place:
-What problems/aspects of a project should I be tackling first, and for how long?
-When should I know I should back out/stop?
-What red flags should I look out for in terms of my work habit? Or what are bad practices?
-How do I maintain motivation throughout the process, especially on top of all other things going on in my life?

For someone who feels like they have a yearning to create something:
-How do I turn my “entrepreneurial spirit” into a reality? Any exercises/practices that can help with this?

I created two separate categories, because they both apply to me. I have one idea I’m working in with a friend right now centered around a web app, but I also find my self wanting to create something new, but don’t have a concrete idea as to what quite yet.

Video 1 has 426 views with 72 hearts. | Video 2 has 112 views with 30 hearts. | Video 3 has 122 views and 6 hearts. Each was posted 1 day ago.

Now, let's understand the basics of algorithm of videos mentioned above. Conclusion: There is no logic at all. And yes, Video 2 has less views than Video 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using TikTok VIA THIS account(account that posted these 3 videos) for about 1 year. Highest rated video has 300k views and 10k likes(Calculate ratio by yourself for another proof, compare it to videos mentioned above). Lowest has 400 views and 2 hearts(also logical one). I've removed around 20 videos with about 10-20k views because later on I understood how bad they are, and I didn't want them to ruin my profile page, someone I actually know might see my profile(yup, they were that bad). Videos mentioned above are actually CATS videos, so there is no reason for TikTok system to block or prevent certain viewers from seeing it. I am not ugly, but anyways I haven't posted a single video ever showing my face. Idk what else to say.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall Conclusion: There is no Algorithm like many 'experts' would disagree with in comment section, or like many 'experts' have wrote on reddit before. Literally, it's nothing else but a JACKPOT. At least for amount of Views. Cheers!

We are a group of graduates from the University of Cambridge.

We’ve been working on building a self-management platform for skin conditions and started launching in some online communities. We had very encouraging and constructive feedback. However, given that we can't repost frequently, our current growth strategy is not sustainable and I feel like there is no logic in trying to come up with a viral element before having a substantial user base. 

Our platform is FREE and also supported by the University as a social venture. So we don't have an urgent time constraint. We also thought of reaching out to charities or support groups but no one takes you seriously before having ""that"" user base. How would you guys approach this problem?

,Entrepreneur,"Hey Team,

We developed the idea in 2013, our first investors in 2014 invested $100k. We raised $700k in the following years. $1m in 2018, $3m in 2019, and now this round.

I moderate this [Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/) community and have watched it grow from 160k to over 800k subscribers and I am the Entrepreneur in Residence at [www.Biocom.org](http://www.biocom.org/) a Life Science trade association in CA.

Fundraising sucks, and it's a brutal activity. This will be my 7th time going through the process. Here to speak my truth and share my experiences.**Here is my process:**

1. I find them on Linkedin and I cold message them using a [strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/iux9ld/let_us_share_business_development_best_practices/) I developed. We also apply to angel groups directly or via an online platform such as gust.com. Although, a warm intro is the best so I always internet stalk to see if we share connections.
2. My call to action is to get them to click this link - [https://linktr.ee/FITForceImpact](https://linktr.ee/FITForceImpact)
3. If they're interested they will respond or book a meeting.
4. Getting them to meet on Zoom is the goal, since we already provided the slide deck, we just move straight to live demos - we don't actually ""pitch them"" but more of an informal Q&amp;A4a. Example of the product - [https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17902722421599795/](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17902722421599795/)
5. This is where we part ways and they ""will let us know if they are interested"". We get a lot of soft ""no"", perpetual maybes, no one wants to be the first money in.5a. The goal of the first meeting is to simply have another meeting. That's a good sign when they want to talk again. An actual investment doesn't happen for several months.
6. So far we have about $150,000 committed to this round. We are offering a 20% discount in the first $1m, so they only pay 80 cents on the dollar for their shares to incentivize early participation.
7. Keep the pipeline full; investors are like cats, you have no control, and you hope for the best. You hope that they will stick with you as the round materializes.

We have changed our model and offer ""Safety as a Service"" for $25/month you get our hardware, the charging case, and a $25,000 out of pocket insurance policy.

We have working units in 5 countries and 8 sports. We have done about $40k in revenue this year and hope to grow rapidly next year.

&lt;p&gt;Fundraising sucks, and it&amp;#39;s a brutal activity. This will be my 7th time going through the process. Here to speak my truth and share my experiences.&lt;strong&gt;Here is my process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find them on Linkedin and I cold message them using a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/iux9ld/let_us_share_business_development_best_practices/""&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; I developed. We also apply to angel groups directly or via an online platform such as gust.com. Although, a warm intro is the best so I always internet stalk to see if we share connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My call to action is to get them to click this link - &lt;a href=""https://linktr.ee/FITForceImpact""&gt;https://linktr.ee/FITForceImpact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they&amp;#39;re interested they will respond or book a meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting them to meet on Zoom is the goal, since we already provided the slide deck, we just move straight to live demos - we don&amp;#39;t actually &amp;quot;pitch them&amp;quot; but more of an informal Q&amp;amp;A4a. Example of the product - &lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17902722421599795/""&gt;https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17902722421599795/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is where we part ways and they &amp;quot;will let us know if they are interested&amp;quot;. We get a lot of soft &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, perpetual maybes, no one wants to be the first money in.5a. The goal of the first meeting is to simply have another meeting. That&amp;#39;s a good sign when they want to talk again. An actual investment doesn&amp;#39;t happen for several months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far we have about $150,000 committed to this round. We are offering a 20% discount in the first $1m, so they only pay 80 cents on the dollar for their shares to incentivize early participation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the pipeline full; investors are like cats, you have no control, and you hope for the best. You hope that they will stick with you as the round materializes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have changed our model and offer &amp;quot;Safety as a Service&amp;quot; for $25/month you get our hardware, the charging case, and a $25,000 out of pocket insurance policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have working units in 5 countries and 8 sports. We have done about $40k in revenue this year and hope to grow rapidly next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASK me anything about fundraising, pitching, outreach, rejection, or early-stage start-ups!&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys!

There's a TON of content out there on SEO - guides, articles, courses, videos, scams, people yelling about it on online forums, etc etc..

Most of it, however, is super impractical. If you want to start doing SEO TODAY and start getting results ASAP, you'll need to do a TON of digging to figure out what's important and what's not.

So we wanted to make everyone's lives super easy and distill our EXACT process of working w/ clients into a stupid-simple, step-by-step practical guide. And so we did. Here we are.

*P.S:*  r/startups*, and* r/seo *loved the guide, so I thought you guys might like it too.* 

# A bit of backstory:

*If you guys haven't seen any of my previous posts, me and my co-founder own an SEO/digital marketing agency, and we've worked w/ a ton of clients helping them go from 0 to 200k+ monthly organic traffic. We've also helped some quite big companies grow their organic traffic (from 1M to over 1.8M monthly organic), using the exact same process.*

So without further ado, grab your popcorn, and be prepared to stick to the screen for a while, cause this is going to be a long post. Here's everything I am going to cover:

* Get your website to run and load 2x - 5x faster (with MINIMAL technical know-how)
* Optimize your landing pages to rank for direct intent keywords (and drive 100% qualified leads)
* Create amazing, long-form content that ranks every time
* How we get a TON of links to our website with ZERO link-building efforts
* How to improve your content’s rankings with Surfer SEO

# Step #1 - Technical Optimization and On-Page SEO

Step #1 to any SEO initiative is getting your technical SEO right.

Now, some of this is going to be a bit technical, so you might just forward this part to your tech team and just skip ahead to ""Step #2 - Keyword Research.""

If you DON'T have a tech team and want a super easy tl;dr, do this:

* Use WP Rocket. It's a WordPress plugin that optimizes a bunch of stuff on your website, making it run significantly faster.
* Use SMUSH to (losslessly) compress all the images on your website. this usually helps a TON w/ load speed.

If you’re a bit more tech-savvy, though, read on!

## Technical SEO Basics

**Sitemap.xml file.** A good sitemap shows Google how to easily navigate your website (and how to find all your content!). If your site runs on WordPress, all you have to do is install YoastSEO or Rankmath SEO, and they’ll create a sitemap for you. Otherwise, you can use an online XML Sitemap generation tool.

**Proper website architecture.** The crawl depth of any page should be lower than 4 (i.e: any given page should be reached with no more than 3 clicks from the homepage). To fix this, you should improve your interlinking (check Step #6 of this guide to learn more).

**Serve images in next-gen format.** Next-gen image formats (JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP) can be compressed a lot better than JPG or PNG images. Using WordPress? Just use Smush and it’ll do ALL the work for you. Otherwise, you can manually compress all images and re-upload them.

**Remove duplicate content.** Google hates duplicate content and will penalize you for it. If you have any duplicate pages, just merge them (by doing a 301 redirect) or delete one or the other.

**Update your ‘robots.txt’ file.** Hide the pages you don’t want Google to index (e.g: non-public, or unimportant pages). If you’re a SaaS, this would be most of your in-app pages. \]

**Optimize all your pages by best practice**. There’s a bunch of general best practices that Google wants you to follow for your web pages (maintain keyword density, have an adequate # of outbound links, etc.). Install YoastSEO or RankMath and use them to optimize all of your web pages.

If you DON’T have any pages that you don’t want to be displayed on Google, you DON’T need robots.txt.

## Advanced Technical SEO

Now, this is where this gets a bit more web-devvy. Other than just optimizing your website for SEO, you should also focus on optimizing your website speed.

Here’s how to do that:

Both for Mobile and PC, your website should load in under 2-3 seconds. While load speed isn’t a DIRECT ranking factor, it does have a very serious impact on your rankings.

After all, if your website doesn’t load for 5 seconds, a bunch of your visitors might drop off.

So, to measure your website speed performance, you can use Pagespeed Insights. Some of the most common issues we have seen clients facing when it comes to website speed and loading time, are the following:

* **Images being resized with CSS or JS.** This adds extra loading time to your site. Use GTMetrix to find which images need resizing. Use an online tool (there are a ton of free ones) to properly resize images (or Photoshop even), and re-upload them.
* **Images not being lazy-loaded.** If your pages contain a lot of images, you MUST activate lazy-loading. This allows images that are below the screen, to be loaded only once the visitor scrolls down enough to see the image.
* **Gzip compression** **not enabled.** Gzip is a compression method that allows network file transfers to happen a ton faster. In other words, your files like your HTML, CSS, and JS load a ton faster.
* **JS, CSS, and HTML not minified/aggregated/in-lined.** If your website is loading slowly because you have 100+ external javascript files and stylesheets being requested from the server, then you need to look into minifying, aggregating, and inlining some of those files.
* **Use Cloudflare + BunnyCDN** Why the combo? Why not just Cloudflare? Well, I won't get into details, I've experimented a bit with it, and if you are looking for something cheap and fast this is the best combo. Cloudflare you can opt in for the free account. BunnyCDN on the other hand is on a pay-as-you-go basis, and unless you are getting over 100K+ visits a month, you'll likely never go above their minimum monthly threshold of $1.

Want to make your life easier AND fix up all these issues and more? Use WP Rocket. The tool basically does all your optimization for you (if you’re using WordPress, of course).

Lastly, i*f you want to validate the website speed optimization changes you've made, or if you simply want to test how your current site is performing, you can use* ***Google Page Speed Insights***\*.\*

*In May 2020, Google rolled out its Core Web Vitals update, which in layman terms means starting next May (2021), the three most important website load speed metrics you will need to worry for ranking will be:*

1. *LCP - Largest Contentful Paint -&gt; under 2.5s*
2. *FID - First Input Delay -&gt; under 100ms*
3. *CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift -&gt; under 0.1*

# Step #2 - Keyword Research

Once your website is 100% optimized, it’s time to define your SEO strategy.

The best way to get started with this is by doing keyword research.

First off, you want to create a keyword research sheet. This is going to be your main hub for all your content operations.

You can use the sheet to:

1. Prioritize content
2. Keep track of the publishing process
3. Get a top-down view of your web pages

And here’s what it covers:

* **Target search phrase**. This is the keyword you’re targeting.
* **Priority**. What’s the priority of this keyword? We usually divide them by 1-2-3…
   * Priority 3 - Top priority keywords. These are usually low competition, high traffic, well-converting, or all 3 at the same time.
   * Priority 2 - Mid-priority keywords.
   * Priority 1 - These are low priority.
* **Status**. What’s the status of the article? We usually divide them by…
   * 1 - Not written
   * 2 - Writer has picked up the topic for the week
   * 3 - The article is being written
   * 4 - The article is in editing phase
   * 5 - The article is published on the blog
* **Topic cluster**. The category that the blog post belongs to.
* **Monthly search volume**. Self-explanatory. This helps you pick a priority for the keyword.
* **CPC (low &amp; high bid)**. Cost per click for the keyword. Generally, unless you’re planning to run search ads, these are not mandatory. They can, however, help you figure out which of your keywords will convert better. **Pro tip:** the higher the CPC, the more likely it is for the keyword to convert well.

Now that you have your sheet (and understand how it works), let’s talk about the “how” of keyword research.

## How to do Keyword Research (Step-by-Step Guide)

There are a ton of different ways to do that (check the “further readings” at the end of this section for a detailed rundown).

Our favorite method, however, is as follows…

Start off by listing out your top 5 SEO competitors.

The key here is SEO competitors - competing companies that have a strong SEO presence in the same niche.

Not sure who’s a good SEO competitor? Google the top keywords that describe your product and find your top-ranking competitors.

Run them through SEMrush (or your favorite SEO tool), and you’ll see how well, exactly, they’re doing with their SEO.

Once you have a list of 5 competitors, run each of them through “Organic Research” on SEMrush, and you'll get a complete list of all the keywords they rank on.

Now, go through these keywords one by one and extract all the relevant ones and add them to your sheet.

Once you go through the top SEO competitors, your keyword research should be around 80%+ done.

Now to put some finishing touches on your keyword research, run your top keywords through UberSuggest and let it do its magic. It's going to give you a bunch of keywords associated with the keywords you input.

Go through all the results it's going to give you, extract anything that’s relevant, and your keyword research should be 90% done.

At this point, you can call it a day and move on to the next step. Chances are, over time, you’ll uncover new keywords to add to your sheet and get you to that sweet 100%.

# Step #3 - Create SEO Landing Pages

Remember how we collected a bunch of landing page keywords in step #2? Now it’s time to build the right page for each of them! This step is a lot more straightforward than you’d think. First off, you create a custom landing page based on the keyword. Depending on your niche, this can be done in 2 ways:

1. Create a general template landing page. Pretty much copy-paste your landing page, alter the sub-headings, paraphrase it a bit, and add relevant images to the use-case. You’d go with this option if the keywords you’re targeting are very similar to your main use-case (e.g. “project management software” “project management system”).
2. Create a unique landing page for each use-case. You should do this if each use-case is unique. For example, if your software doubles as project management software and workflow management software. In this case, you’ll need two completely new landing pages for each keyword.

Once you have a bunch of these pages ready, you should optimize them for their respective keywords.

You can do this by running the page content through an SEO tool. If you’re using WordPress, you can do this through RankMath or Yoast SEO.

Both tools will give you exact instructions on how to optimize your page for the keyword.

If you’re not using WordPress, you can use SurferSEO. Just copy-paste your web page content, and it’s going to give you instructions on how to optimize it.

Once your new landing pages are live, you need to pick where you want to place them on your website. We usually recommend adding these pages to your website’s navigation menu (header) or footer.

Finally, once you have all these new landing pages up, you might be thinking “Now what? How, and when, are these pages going to rank?”

Generally, landing pages are a tad harder to rank than content. See, with content, quality plays a huge part. Write better, longer, and more informative content than your competition, and you’re going to eventually outrank them even if they have more links.

With landing pages, things aren’t as cut and dry. More often than not, you can’t just “create a better landing page.”

What determines rankings for landing page keywords are backlinks. If your competitors have 400 links on their landing pages, while yours has 40, chances are, you’re not going to outrank them.

# Step #4 - Create SEO Blog Content

Now, let’s talk about the other side of the coin: content keywords, and how to create content that ranks.

As we mentioned before, these keywords aren’t direct-intent (the Googler isn’t SPECIFICALLY looking for your product), but they can still convert pretty well. For example, if you’re a digital marketing agency, you could rank on keywords like…

* Lead generation techniques
* SaaS marketing
* SEO content

After all, anyone looking to learn about lead gen techniques might also be willing to pay you to do it for them.

On top of this, blog post keywords are way easier to rank for than your landing pages - you can beat competition simply by creating significantly better content without turning it into a backlink war.In order to create good SEO content, you need to do 2 things right:

1. Create a comprehensive content outline
2. Get the writing part right

Here’s how each of these work...

## How to Create a Content Outline for SEO

A content outline is a document that has all the info on what type of information the article should contain Usually, this includes:

* Which headers and subheaders you should use
* What’s the optimal word count
* What information, exactly, should each section of the article cover
* If you’re not using Yoast or Rankmath, you can also mention the SEO optimization requirements (keyword density, # of outbound links, etc.)

Outlines are useful if you’re working with a writing team that isn’t 100% familiar with SEO, allowing them to write content that ranks without any SEO know-how.

At the same time, even if you’re the one doing the writing, an outline can help you get a top-down idea of what you should cover in the article.

So, how do you create an outline? Here’s a simplified step-by-step process…

1. Determine the target word count. Rule of thumb: aim for 1.5x - 2x whatever your competitor wrote. You can disregard this if your competition was super comprehensive with their content, and just go for the same length instead.
2. Create a similar header structure as your competition. Indicate for the writer which headers should be h2, which ones h3.
3. For each header, mention what it’s about. Pro tip - you can borrow ideas from the top 5 ranking articles.
4. For each header, explain what, exactly, should the writer mention (in simple words).
5. Finally, do some first-hand research on Reddit and Quora. What are the questions your target audience has around your topic? What else could you add to the article that would be super valuable for your customers?

## How to Write Well

There’s a lot more to good content than giving an outline to a writer. Sure, they can hit all the right points, but if the writing itself is mediocre, no one’s going to stick around to read your article.

Here are some essential tips you should keep in mind for writing content (or managing a team of writers):

1. Write for your audience. Are you a B2B enterprise SaaS? Your blog posts should be more formal and professional. B2C, super-consumer product? Talk in a more casual, relaxed fashion. Sprinkle your content with pop culture references for bonus points!
2. Avoid fluff. Every single sentence should have some sort of value (conveying information, cracking a joke, etc.). Avoid beating around the bush, and be as straightforward as possible.
3. Keep your audience’s knowledge in mind. For example, if your audience is a bunch of rocket scientists, you don’t have to explain to them how 1+1=2.
4. Create a writer guideline (or just steal ours! -&gt; edit: sorry had to remove link due to posting guidelines)
5. Use Grammarly and Hemingway. The first is like your personal pocket editor, and the latter helps make your content easier to read.
6. Hire the right writers. Chances are, you’re too busy to write your own content. We usually recommend using ProBlogger or Cult of Copy Job Board (Facebook Group) to source top writing talent.

# Step #5 - Start Link-Building Operations

Links are essential if you want your content or web pages to rank.

If you’re in a competitive niche, links are going to be the final deciding factor on what ranks and what doesn’t.

In the VPN niche, for example, everyone has good content. That’s just the baseline. The real competition is in the backlinks.

To better illustrate this example, if you Google “best VPN,” you’ll see that all top-ranking content pieces are almost the same thing. They’re all:

* Well-written
* Long-form
* Easy to navigate
* Well-formatted (to enhance UX)

So, the determining factor is links. If you check all the top-ranking articles with the Moz Toolbar Extension, you’ll see that on average, each page has a minimum of 300 links (and some over 100,000!).

Meaning, to compete, you’ll really need to double-down on your link-building effort.

In fact, in the most competitive SEO niches, it’s not uncommon to spend $20,000 per month on link-building efforts alone.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Pro Tip**  
&gt;  
&gt;Got scared by the high $$$ some companies spend on link-building? Well, worry not!  
&gt;  
&gt;Only the most ever-green niches are so competitive. Think, VPN, make money online, health and fitness, dating, CBD, gambling, etc. So you know, the usual culprits.  
&gt;  
&gt;For most other niches, you can even rank with minimal links, as long as you have top-tier SEO content.

Now, let’s ask the million-dollar question: *“how do you do link-building?”*

# 4 Evergreen Link Building Strategies for Any Website

There are a TON of different link building strategies on the web. Broken link building, scholarship link building, stealing competitor links, and so on and so on and so on.

We’re not going to list every single link building strategy out there (mainly because Backlinko already did that in their link building guide).

What we are going to do, though, is list out some of our favorite strategies, and link you to resources where you can learn more:

1. **Broken link building**. You find dead pages with a lot of backlinks, reach out to websites that linked to them, and pitch them something like “hey, you linked to this article, but it’s dead. We thought you’d want to fix that. You can use our recent article if you think it’s cool enough.”
2. **Guest posting.** Probably the most popular link building strategy. Find blogs that accept guest posts, and send them a pitch! They usually let you include 1-2 do-follow links back to your website.
3. “**Linkable asset” link building**. A linkable asset is a resource that is so AWESOME that you just can’t help but link to. Think, infographics, online calculators, first-hand studies or research, stuff like that. The tl;dr here is, you create an awesome resource, and promote the hell out of it on the web.
4. **Skyscraper technique**. The skyscraper technique is a term coined by Backlinko. The gist of it is, you find link-worthy content on the web, create something even better, and reach out to the right people.

Most of these strategies work, and you can find a ton of resources on the web if you want to learn more.

However, if you’re looking for something a bit different, oh boy we have a treat for you! We’re going to teach you a link-building strategy that got us around:

* 10,000+ traffic within a week
* 15+ leads
* 50+ links

...And so much more, all through a *single* blog post.

# Link-Building Case Study: SaaS Marketing

*“So, what’s this ancient link-building tactic?”*

I hear you asking. It must be something super secretive and esoteric, right?

Secrets learned straight from the link-building monks at an ancient SEO temple…

*“Right?”*

Well, not quite.

The tactic isn’t something too unusual - it’s pretty famous on the web. This tactic comes in 2 steps:

1. Figure out where your target audience hangs out (create a list of the channels)
2. Research the type of content your audience loves
3. Create EPIC content based on that research (give TONS of value)
4. Promote the HELL out of it in the channels from step 1

Nothing too new, right?

Well, you’d be surprised how many people don’t use it.

Now, before you start throwing stones at us for overhyping something so simple, let’s dive into the case study:

**How we PR’d the hell out of our guide to SaaS marketing** (can't add a link, but it's on our blog and it's 14k words long), **and got 10k+ traffic as a result.**

A few months back when we launched our blog, we were deciding on what our initial content should be about.

Since we specialize in helping SaaS companies acquire new users, we decided to create a mega-authority guide to SaaS marketing (AND try to get it to rank for its respective keyword).

We went through the top-ranking content pieces, and saw that none of them was anything too impressive.

Most of them were about general startup marketing strategies - how to validate your MVP, find a product-market fit, etc.

Pretty “meh,” if you ask us. We believe that the #1 thing founders are looking for when Googling “saas marketing” are practical channels and tactics you can use to acquire new users.

So, it all started off with an idea: create a listicle of the top SaaS marketing tactics out there:

1. How to create good content to drive users
2. Promote your content
3. Rank on Google
4. Create viral infographics
5. Create a micro-site

...and we ended up overdoing it, covering 41+ different tactics and case studies and hitting around 14k+ words.

On one hand, oops! On the other hand, we had some pretty epic content on our hands. We even added the Smart Content Filter to make the article much easier to navigate.

Once the article was up, we ran it through some of our clients, friends, and acquaintances, and received some really good feedback.

So, now we knew it was worth promoting the hell out of it.

We came up with a huge list of all online channels that would appreciate this article:

1. r/ entrepreneur and r/ startups (hi guys!). The first ended up loving the post, netting us \~600 upboats and a platinum medal. The latter also ended up loving the post, but the mods decided to be assholes and remove it for being “self-promotional.” So, despite the community loving the content, it got axed by the mods. Sad. (Fun fact - this one time we tried to submit another content piece on r/ startups with no company names, no links back to our website, or anything that can be deemed promotional. One of the mods removed it for mentioning a link to Ahrefs. Go figure!)
2. Hacker News. Tons of founders hang out on HN, so we thought they’d appreciate anything SaaS-related. This netted us around \~200+ upvotes and some awesome feedback (thanks HN!)
3. Submit on Growth Hackers, Indie Hackers, and all other online marketing communities. We got a bunch of love on Indie Hackers, the rest were quite inactive.
4. Reach out to all personal connects + clients and ask for a share
5. Run Facebook/Twitter ads. This didn’t particularly work out too well for us, so we dropped it after 1-2 weeks.
6. Run a Quuu promotion. If you haven’t heard of Quuu, it’s a platform that matches people who want their content to be shared, with people who want their social media profiles running on 100% auto-pilot. We also got “meh” results here - tons of shares, next to no likes or link clicks.
7. Promoted in SaaS and marketing Facebook groups. This had awesome results both in terms of traffic, as well as making new friends, AND getting new leads.
8. Promoted in entrepreneur Slack channels. This worked OK - didn’t net us traffic, but got us some new friends.
9. Emailed anyone we mentioned in the article and asked for a share. Since we mentioned too many high profile peeps and not enough non-celebs, this didn’t work out too well
10. Emailed influencers that we thought would like the article / give it a share. They didn’t. We were heart-broken.

And accordingly, created a checklist + distribution sheet with all the websites or emails of people we wanted to ping.

Overall, this netted us around 12,000 page views in total, 15+ leads, 6,000 traffic in just 2 promotion days.

As for SEO results, we got a bunch of links. (I would have added screenshots to all of these results, but don't think this subreddit allows it).

A lot of these are no-follow from Reddit, HackerNews, and other submission websites, but a lot of them are also pretty authentic.

The cool part about this link-building tactic is that people link to you without even asking. You create awesome content that helps people, and you get rewarded with links, shares, and traffic!

And as for the cherry on top, only 2 months after publishing the article, it’s ranking on position #28. We’re expecting it to get to page 1 within the new few months and top 3 within the year.

# Step #6 - Interlink Your Pages

One of Google's ranking factors is how long your visitors stick around on your website.

So, you need to encourage users reading ONE article, to read, well, the rest of them (or at least browse around your website). This is done through interlinking.

The idea is that each of your web pages should be linked to and from every other relevant page on your site.

Say, an article on ""how to make a resume"" could link to (and be linked from) ""how to include contact info on a resume,"" ""how to write a cover letter,"" ""what's the difference between a CV and a resume,"" and so on.

Proper interlinking alone can have a significant impact on your website rankings. NinjaOutreach, for example, managed to improve their organic traffic by 40% through better interlinking alone.

So, how do you do interlinking “right?”

First off, make it a requirement for your writers to link to the rest of your content. Add a clause to your writer guidelines that each article should have 10+ links to your other content pieces.

More often than not, they’ll manage to get 60-70% of interlinking opportunities. To get this to 100%, we usually do bi-annual interlinking runs. Here’s how that works.

Pick an article you want to interlink. Let’s say, for example, an article on 'business process management'.

The goal here is to find as many existing articles on your blog, where ‘business process management’ is mentioned so that we can add a link to the article.

Firstly, Google the keyword ‘business process management’ by doing a Google search on your domain. You can use the following query:

*site:yourwebsite.com ""keyword""*

In our case, that’s:

site:example.com “business process management”

You’ll get a complete list of articles that mention the keyword “business process management.

Now, all you have to do is go through each of these, and make sure that the keyword is hyperlinked to the respective article!

You should also do this for all the synonyms of the keyword for this article. For example, “BPM” is an acronym for business process management, so you’d want to link this article there too.

# Step #7 - Track &amp; Improve Your Headline CTRs

Article CTRs play a huge role in determining what ranks or not.

Let’s say your article ranks #4 with a CTR of 15%. Google benchmarks this CTR with the average CTR for the position.

If the average CTR for position #4 is 12%, Google will assume that your article, with a CTR of 15% is of high quality, and will reward you with better rankings.

On the other hand, if the average CTR is 18%, Google will assume that your article isn’t as valuable as other ranking content pieces, and will lower your ranking.

So, it’s important to keep track of your Click Through Rates for all your articles, and when you see something that’s underperforming, you can test different headlines to see if they’ll improve CTR.

Now, you’re probably wondering, how do you figure out what’s the average CTR?

Unfortunately, each search result is different, and there's no one size fits all formula for average CTR.

Over the past few years, Google has been implementing a bunch of different types of search results - featured snippet, QAs, and a lot of other types of search results.

So, depending on how many of these clutter and the search results for your given keyword, you’ll get different average CTRs by position.

Rule of thumb, you can follow these values:

* 1st position -&gt; \~31.73% CTR
* 2nd pos. -&gt; \~24.71%
* 3rd pos. -&gt; 18.66%
* 4th pos. -&gt; 13.60%
* 5th -&gt; 9.51%
* 6th -&gt; 6.23%
* 7th -&gt; 4.15%
* 8th -&gt; 3.12%
* 9th -&gt; 2.97%

Keep in mind these change a lot depending on your industry, PPC competitiveness, 0-click searches, etc...

**Use a scraping tool** like Screaming Frog to extract the following data from all your web pages:

* Page title
* Page URL
* Old Headline

Delete all the pages that aren’t meant to rank on Google. Then, head over to Google Search Console and extract the following data for all the web pages:

* CTR (28 Day Range)
* Avg. Position

Add all of this data to a spreadsheet.

Now, check what your competition is doing and use that to come up with new headline ideas. Then, put them in the *Title Ideas* cell for the respective keyword.

For each keyword, come up with 4-5 different headlines, and implement the (seemingly) best title for each article.

Once you implement the change, insert the date on the *Date Implemented* column. This will help you keep track of progress.

Then, wait for around 3 - 4 weeks to see what kind of impact this change is going to have on your rankings and CTR.

If the results are not satisfactory, record the results in the respective cells, and implement another test for the following month. Make sure to update the *Date Implemented* column once again.

# Step #8 - Keep Track of Rankings &amp; Make Improvements On-The-Go

You’re never really “done” with SEO - you should always keep track of your rankings and see if there’s any room for improvement.

If you wait for an adequate time-frame after publishing a post (6 months to a year) and you’re still seeing next to no results, then it might be time to investigate.

Here’s what this usually looks like for us:

* **Audit the content**
   * Does your content have an adequate word count? Think, 1.5-2x your competitors.
   * Is the content well-written?
   * Do the images in your article add value? E.g. no stock or irrelevant images.
   * Is the content optimized for SEO? Think, keyword density, links to external websites, etc.
* **Audit internal links**
   * Does the content link to an adequate number of your other articles or web pages?
   * Is the article linked to from an adequate number of your web pages or blog posts? You can check this on Search Console =&gt; Links =&gt; Internal Links. Or, if you’re using Yoast or RankMath, you can check the # of internal links a post has in the WordPress Dashboard -&gt; Posts.
* **Audit the backlinks**
   * Do you have as many backlinks as your competitors?
   * Are your backlinks from the countries you want to rank in? If you have a bunch of links from India, but you want to rank in the US, you’d need to get more US links.
   * Are your links high quality? More often than not, low DA / PA links are not that helpful.
   * Did you disown low-quality or spam links?
* **Audit web page**
   * Does the web page load too slow? Think, 4+ seconds.
   * Did you enable lazy loading for the images?
   * Did you compress all images on the web page?

...And that's it.

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, grab your popcorn, and be prepared to stick to the screen for a while, cause this is going to be a long post. Here&amp;#39;s everything I am going to cover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your website to run and load 2x - 5x faster (with MINIMAL technical know-how)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize your landing pages to rank for direct intent keywords (and drive 100% qualified leads)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create amazing, long-form content that ranks every time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we get a TON of links to our website with ZERO link-building efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to improve your content’s rankings with Surfer SEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #1 - Technical Optimization and On-Page SEO&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step #1 to any SEO initiative is getting your technical SEO right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, some of this is going to be a bit technical, so you might just forward this part to your tech team and just skip ahead to &amp;quot;Step #2 - Keyword Research.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you DON&amp;#39;T have a tech team and want a super easy tl;dr, do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use WP Rocket. It&amp;#39;s a WordPress plugin that optimizes a bunch of stuff on your website, making it run significantly faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SMUSH to (losslessly) compress all the images on your website. this usually helps a TON w/ load speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a bit more tech-savvy, though, read on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Technical SEO Basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sitemap.xml file.&lt;/strong&gt; A good sitemap shows Google how to easily navigate your website (and how to find all your content!). If your site runs on WordPress, all you have to do is install YoastSEO or Rankmath SEO, and they’ll create a sitemap for you. Otherwise, you can use an online XML Sitemap generation tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper website architecture.&lt;/strong&gt; The crawl depth of any page should be lower than 4 (i.e: any given page should be reached with no more than 3 clicks from the homepage). To fix this, you should improve your interlinking (check Step #6 of this guide to learn more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve images in next-gen format.&lt;/strong&gt; Next-gen image formats (JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP) can be compressed a lot better than JPG or PNG images. Using WordPress? Just use Smush and it’ll do ALL the work for you. Otherwise, you can manually compress all images and re-upload them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove duplicate content.&lt;/strong&gt; Google hates duplicate content and will penalize you for it. If you have any duplicate pages, just merge them (by doing a 301 redirect) or delete one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update your ‘robots.txt’ file.&lt;/strong&gt; Hide the pages you don’t want Google to index (e.g: non-public, or unimportant pages). If you’re a SaaS, this would be most of your in-app pages. ]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimize all your pages by best practice&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s a bunch of general best practices that Google wants you to follow for your web pages (maintain keyword density, have an adequate # of outbound links, etc.). Install YoastSEO or RankMath and use them to optimize all of your web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you DON’T have any pages that you don’t want to be displayed on Google, you DON’T need robots.txt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Technical SEO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is where this gets a bit more web-devvy. Other than just optimizing your website for SEO, you should also focus on optimizing your website speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both for Mobile and PC, your website should load in under 2-3 seconds. While load speed isn’t a DIRECT ranking factor, it does have a very serious impact on your rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, if your website doesn’t load for 5 seconds, a bunch of your visitors might drop off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to measure your website speed performance, you can use Pagespeed Insights. Some of the most common issues we have seen clients facing when it comes to website speed and loading time, are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images being resized with CSS or JS.&lt;/strong&gt; This adds extra loading time to your site. Use GTMetrix to find which images need resizing. Use an online tool (there are a ton of free ones) to properly resize images (or Photoshop even), and re-upload them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images not being lazy-loaded.&lt;/strong&gt; If your pages contain a lot of images, you MUST activate lazy-loading. This allows images that are below the screen, to be loaded only once the visitor scrolls down enough to see the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gzip compression&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;not enabled.&lt;/strong&gt; Gzip is a compression method that allows network file transfers to happen a ton faster. In other words, your files like your HTML, CSS, and JS load a ton faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JS, CSS, and HTML not minified/aggregated/in-lined.&lt;/strong&gt; If your website is loading slowly because you have 100+ external javascript files and stylesheets being requested from the server, then you need to look into minifying, aggregating, and inlining some of those files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Cloudflare + BunnyCDN&lt;/strong&gt; Why the combo? Why not just Cloudflare? Well, I won&amp;#39;t get into details, I&amp;#39;ve experimented a bit with it, and if you are looking for something cheap and fast this is the best combo. Cloudflare you can opt in for the free account. BunnyCDN on the other hand is on a pay-as-you-go basis, and unless you are getting over 100K+ visits a month, you&amp;#39;ll likely never go above their minimum monthly threshold of $1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to make your life easier AND fix up all these issues and more? Use WP Rocket. The tool basically does all your optimization for you (if you’re using WordPress, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, i&lt;em&gt;f you want to validate the website speed optimization changes you&amp;#39;ve made, or if you simply want to test how your current site is performing, you can use&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Page Speed Insights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In May 2020, Google rolled out its Core Web Vitals update, which in layman terms means starting next May (2021), the three most important website load speed metrics you will need to worry for ranking will be:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;LCP - Largest Contentful Paint -&amp;gt; under 2.5s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;FID - First Input Delay -&amp;gt; under 100ms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift -&amp;gt; under 0.1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #2 - Keyword Research&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your website is 100% optimized, it’s time to define your SEO strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to get started with this is by doing keyword research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, you want to create a keyword research sheet. This is going to be your main hub for all your content operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the sheet to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of the publishing process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a top-down view of your web pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s what it covers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target search phrase&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the keyword you’re targeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority&lt;/strong&gt;. What’s the priority of this keyword? We usually divide them by 1-2-3…

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority 3 - Top priority keywords. These are usually low competition, high traffic, well-converting, or all 3 at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority 2 - Mid-priority keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority 1 - These are low priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status&lt;/strong&gt;. What’s the status of the article? We usually divide them by…

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 - Not written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 - Writer has picked up the topic for the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 - The article is being written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 - The article is in editing phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 - The article is published on the blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic cluster&lt;/strong&gt;. The category that the blog post belongs to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly search volume&lt;/strong&gt;. Self-explanatory. This helps you pick a priority for the keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPC (low &amp;amp; high bid)&lt;/strong&gt;. Cost per click for the keyword. Generally, unless you’re planning to run search ads, these are not mandatory. They can, however, help you figure out which of your keywords will convert better. &lt;strong&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/strong&gt; the higher the CPC, the more likely it is for the keyword to convert well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your sheet (and understand how it works), let’s talk about the “how” of keyword research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to do Keyword Research (Step-by-Step Guide)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of different ways to do that (check the “further readings” at the end of this section for a detailed rundown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our favorite method, however, is as follows…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start off by listing out your top 5 SEO competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here is SEO competitors - competing companies that have a strong SEO presence in the same niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure who’s a good SEO competitor? Google the top keywords that describe your product and find your top-ranking competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run them through SEMrush (or your favorite SEO tool), and you’ll see how well, exactly, they’re doing with their SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a list of 5 competitors, run each of them through “Organic Research” on SEMrush, and you&amp;#39;ll get a complete list of all the keywords they rank on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go through these keywords one by one and extract all the relevant ones and add them to your sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you go through the top SEO competitors, your keyword research should be around 80%+ done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to put some finishing touches on your keyword research, run your top keywords through UberSuggest and let it do its magic. It&amp;#39;s going to give you a bunch of keywords associated with the keywords you input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through all the results it&amp;#39;s going to give you, extract anything that’s relevant, and your keyword research should be 90% done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can call it a day and move on to the next step. Chances are, over time, you’ll uncover new keywords to add to your sheet and get you to that sweet 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #3 - Create SEO Landing Pages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how we collected a bunch of landing page keywords in step #2? Now it’s time to build the right page for each of them! This step is a lot more straightforward than you’d think. First off, you create a custom landing page based on the keyword. Depending on your niche, this can be done in 2 ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a general template landing page. Pretty much copy-paste your landing page, alter the sub-headings, paraphrase it a bit, and add relevant images to the use-case. You’d go with this option if the keywords you’re targeting are very similar to your main use-case (e.g. “project management software” “project management system”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a unique landing page for each use-case. You should do this if each use-case is unique. For example, if your software doubles as project management software and workflow management software. In this case, you’ll need two completely new landing pages for each keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have a bunch of these pages ready, you should optimize them for their respective keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this by running the page content through an SEO tool. If you’re using WordPress, you can do this through RankMath or Yoast SEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both tools will give you exact instructions on how to optimize your page for the keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not using WordPress, you can use SurferSEO. Just copy-paste your web page content, and it’s going to give you instructions on how to optimize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your new landing pages are live, you need to pick where you want to place them on your website. We usually recommend adding these pages to your website’s navigation menu (header) or footer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, once you have all these new landing pages up, you might be thinking “Now what? How, and when, are these pages going to rank?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, landing pages are a tad harder to rank than content. See, with content, quality plays a huge part. Write better, longer, and more informative content than your competition, and you’re going to eventually outrank them even if they have more links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With landing pages, things aren’t as cut and dry. More often than not, you can’t just “create a better landing page.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What determines rankings for landing page keywords are backlinks. If your competitors have 400 links on their landing pages, while yours has 40, chances are, you’re not going to outrank them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #4 - Create SEO Blog Content&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s talk about the other side of the coin: content keywords, and how to create content that ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned before, these keywords aren’t direct-intent (the Googler isn’t SPECIFICALLY looking for your product), but they can still convert pretty well. For example, if you’re a digital marketing agency, you could rank on keywords like…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead generation techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SaaS marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SEO content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, anyone looking to learn about lead gen techniques might also be willing to pay you to do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this, blog post keywords are way easier to rank for than your landing pages - you can beat competition simply by creating significantly better content without turning it into a backlink war.In order to create good SEO content, you need to do 2 things right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a comprehensive content outline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the writing part right&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how each of these work...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Create a Content Outline for SEO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A content outline is a document that has all the info on what type of information the article should contain Usually, this includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which headers and subheaders you should use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the optimal word count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What information, exactly, should each section of the article cover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re not using Yoast or Rankmath, you can also mention the SEO optimization requirements (keyword density, # of outbound links, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlines are useful if you’re working with a writing team that isn’t 100% familiar with SEO, allowing them to write content that ranks without any SEO know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, even if you’re the one doing the writing, an outline can help you get a top-down idea of what you should cover in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do you create an outline? Here’s a simplified step-by-step process…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the target word count. Rule of thumb: aim for 1.5x - 2x whatever your competitor wrote. You can disregard this if your competition was super comprehensive with their content, and just go for the same length instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a similar header structure as your competition. Indicate for the writer which headers should be h2, which ones h3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each header, mention what it’s about. Pro tip - you can borrow ideas from the top 5 ranking articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each header, explain what, exactly, should the writer mention (in simple words).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, do some first-hand research on Reddit and Quora. What are the questions your target audience has around your topic? What else could you add to the article that would be super valuable for your customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Write Well&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more to good content than giving an outline to a writer. Sure, they can hit all the right points, but if the writing itself is mediocre, no one’s going to stick around to read your article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some essential tips you should keep in mind for writing content (or managing a team of writers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write for your audience. Are you a B2B enterprise SaaS? Your blog posts should be more formal and professional. B2C, super-consumer product? Talk in a more casual, relaxed fashion. Sprinkle your content with pop culture references for bonus points!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid fluff. Every single sentence should have some sort of value (conveying information, cracking a joke, etc.). Avoid beating around the bush, and be as straightforward as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your audience’s knowledge in mind. For example, if your audience is a bunch of rocket scientists, you don’t have to explain to them how 1+1=2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a writer guideline (or just steal ours! -&amp;gt; edit: sorry had to remove link due to posting guidelines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Grammarly and Hemingway. The first is like your personal pocket editor, and the latter helps make your content easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire the right writers. Chances are, you’re too busy to write your own content. We usually recommend using ProBlogger or Cult of Copy Job Board (Facebook Group) to source top writing talent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #5 - Start Link-Building Operations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links are essential if you want your content or web pages to rank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a competitive niche, links are going to be the final deciding factor on what ranks and what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the VPN niche, for example, everyone has good content. That’s just the baseline. The real competition is in the backlinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better illustrate this example, if you Google “best VPN,” you’ll see that all top-ranking content pieces are almost the same thing. They’re all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-written&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to navigate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-formatted (to enhance UX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the determining factor is links. If you check all the top-ranking articles with the Moz Toolbar Extension, you’ll see that on average, each page has a minimum of 300 links (and some over 100,000!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meaning, to compete, you’ll really need to double-down on your link-building effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in the most competitive SEO niches, it’s not uncommon to spend $20,000 per month on link-building efforts alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got scared by the high $$$ some companies spend on link-building? Well, worry not!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the most ever-green niches are so competitive. Think, VPN, make money online, health and fitness, dating, CBD, gambling, etc. So you know, the usual culprits.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most other niches, you can even rank with minimal links, as long as you have top-tier SEO content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s ask the million-dollar question: &lt;em&gt;“how do you do link-building?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4 Evergreen Link Building Strategies for Any Website&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a TON of different link building strategies on the web. Broken link building, scholarship link building, stealing competitor links, and so on and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to list every single link building strategy out there (mainly because Backlinko already did that in their link building guide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are going to do, though, is list out some of our favorite strategies, and link you to resources where you can learn more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken link building&lt;/strong&gt;. You find dead pages with a lot of backlinks, reach out to websites that linked to them, and pitch them something like “hey, you linked to this article, but it’s dead. We thought you’d want to fix that. You can use our recent article if you think it’s cool enough.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest posting.&lt;/strong&gt; Probably the most popular link building strategy. Find blogs that accept guest posts, and send them a pitch! They usually let you include 1-2 do-follow links back to your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Linkable asset” link building&lt;/strong&gt;. A linkable asset is a resource that is so AWESOME that you just can’t help but link to. Think, infographics, online calculators, first-hand studies or research, stuff like that. The tl;dr here is, you create an awesome resource, and promote the hell out of it on the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skyscraper technique&lt;/strong&gt;. The skyscraper technique is a term coined by Backlinko. The gist of it is, you find link-worthy content on the web, create something even better, and reach out to the right people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these strategies work, and you can find a ton of resources on the web if you want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re looking for something a bit different, oh boy we have a treat for you! We’re going to teach you a link-building strategy that got us around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10,000+ traffic within a week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15+ leads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50+ links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...And so much more, all through a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Link-Building Case Study: SaaS Marketing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“So, what’s this ancient link-building tactic?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear you asking. It must be something super secretive and esoteric, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets learned straight from the link-building monks at an ancient SEO temple…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Right?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactic isn’t something too unusual - it’s pretty famous on the web. This tactic comes in 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out where your target audience hangs out (create a list of the channels)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research the type of content your audience loves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create EPIC content based on that research (give TONS of value)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote the HELL out of it in the channels from step 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too new, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you’d be surprised how many people don’t use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before you start throwing stones at us for overhyping something so simple, let’s dive into the case study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we PR’d the hell out of our guide to SaaS marketing&lt;/strong&gt; (can&amp;#39;t add a link, but it&amp;#39;s on our blog and it&amp;#39;s 14k words long), &lt;strong&gt;and got 10k+ traffic as a result.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back when we launched our blog, we were deciding on what our initial content should be about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we specialize in helping SaaS companies acquire new users, we decided to create a mega-authority guide to SaaS marketing (AND try to get it to rank for its respective keyword).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went through the top-ranking content pieces, and saw that none of them was anything too impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of them were about general startup marketing strategies - how to validate your MVP, find a product-market fit, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty “meh,” if you ask us. We believe that the #1 thing founders are looking for when Googling “saas marketing” are practical channels and tactics you can use to acquire new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it all started off with an idea: create a listicle of the top SaaS marketing tactics out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create good content to drive users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote your content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rank on Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create viral infographics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a micro-site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and we ended up overdoing it, covering 41+ different tactics and case studies and hitting around 14k+ words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, oops! On the other hand, we had some pretty epic content on our hands. We even added the Smart Content Filter to make the article much easier to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the article was up, we ran it through some of our clients, friends, and acquaintances, and received some really good feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now we knew it was worth promoting the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came up with a huge list of all online channels that would appreciate this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;r/ entrepreneur and r/ startups (hi guys!). The first ended up loving the post, netting us ~600 upboats and a platinum medal. The latter also ended up loving the post, but the mods decided to be assholes and remove it for being “self-promotional.” So, despite the community loving the content, it got axed by the mods. Sad. (Fun fact - this one time we tried to submit another content piece on r/ startups with no company names, no links back to our website, or anything that can be deemed promotional. One of the mods removed it for mentioning a link to Ahrefs. Go figure!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacker News. Tons of founders hang out on HN, so we thought they’d appreciate anything SaaS-related. This netted us around ~200+ upvotes and some awesome feedback (thanks HN!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit on Growth Hackers, Indie Hackers, and all other online marketing communities. We got a bunch of love on Indie Hackers, the rest were quite inactive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to all personal connects + clients and ask for a share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Facebook/Twitter ads. This didn’t particularly work out too well for us, so we dropped it after 1-2 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a Quuu promotion. If you haven’t heard of Quuu, it’s a platform that matches people who want their content to be shared, with people who want their social media profiles running on 100% auto-pilot. We also got “meh” results here - tons of shares, next to no likes or link clicks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoted in SaaS and marketing Facebook groups. This had awesome results both in terms of traffic, as well as making new friends, AND getting new leads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoted in entrepreneur Slack channels. This worked OK - didn’t net us traffic, but got us some new friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emailed anyone we mentioned in the article and asked for a share. Since we mentioned too many high profile peeps and not enough non-celebs, this didn’t work out too well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emailed influencers that we thought would like the article / give it a share. They didn’t. We were heart-broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And accordingly, created a checklist + distribution sheet with all the websites or emails of people we wanted to ping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this netted us around 12,000 page views in total, 15+ leads, 6,000 traffic in just 2 promotion days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for SEO results, we got a bunch of links. (I would have added screenshots to all of these results, but don&amp;#39;t think this subreddit allows it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of these are no-follow from Reddit, HackerNews, and other submission websites, but a lot of them are also pretty authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cool part about this link-building tactic is that people link to you without even asking. You create awesome content that helps people, and you get rewarded with links, shares, and traffic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for the cherry on top, only 2 months after publishing the article, it’s ranking on position #28. We’re expecting it to get to page 1 within the new few months and top 3 within the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #6 - Interlink Your Pages&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Google&amp;#39;s ranking factors is how long your visitors stick around on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you need to encourage users reading ONE article, to read, well, the rest of them (or at least browse around your website). This is done through interlinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that each of your web pages should be linked to and from every other relevant page on your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, an article on &amp;quot;how to make a resume&amp;quot; could link to (and be linked from) &amp;quot;how to include contact info on a resume,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;how to write a cover letter,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the difference between a CV and a resume,&amp;quot; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proper interlinking alone can have a significant impact on your website rankings. NinjaOutreach, for example, managed to improve their organic traffic by 40% through better interlinking alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do you do interlinking “right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, make it a requirement for your writers to link to the rest of your content. Add a clause to your writer guidelines that each article should have 10+ links to your other content pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, they’ll manage to get 60-70% of interlinking opportunities. To get this to 100%, we usually do bi-annual interlinking runs. Here’s how that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick an article you want to interlink. Let’s say, for example, an article on &amp;#39;business process management&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to find as many existing articles on your blog, where ‘business process management’ is mentioned so that we can add a link to the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Google the keyword ‘business process management’ by doing a Google search on your domain. You can use the following query:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;site:yourwebsite.com &amp;quot;keyword&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, that’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;site:example.com “business process management”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll get a complete list of articles that mention the keyword “business process management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all you have to do is go through each of these, and make sure that the keyword is hyperlinked to the respective article!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also do this for all the synonyms of the keyword for this article. For example, “BPM” is an acronym for business process management, so you’d want to link this article there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #7 - Track &amp;amp; Improve Your Headline CTRs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article CTRs play a huge role in determining what ranks or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say your article ranks #4 with a CTR of 15%. Google benchmarks this CTR with the average CTR for the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the average CTR for position #4 is 12%, Google will assume that your article, with a CTR of 15% is of high quality, and will reward you with better rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the average CTR is 18%, Google will assume that your article isn’t as valuable as other ranking content pieces, and will lower your ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s important to keep track of your Click Through Rates for all your articles, and when you see something that’s underperforming, you can test different headlines to see if they’ll improve CTR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you’re probably wondering, how do you figure out what’s the average CTR?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, each search result is different, and there&amp;#39;s no one size fits all formula for average CTR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Google has been implementing a bunch of different types of search results - featured snippet, QAs, and a lot of other types of search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, depending on how many of these clutter and the search results for your given keyword, you’ll get different average CTRs by position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb, you can follow these values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st position -&amp;gt; ~31.73% CTR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd pos. -&amp;gt; ~24.71%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd pos. -&amp;gt; 18.66%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4th pos. -&amp;gt; 13.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5th -&amp;gt; 9.51%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6th -&amp;gt; 6.23%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7th -&amp;gt; 4.15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8th -&amp;gt; 3.12%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9th -&amp;gt; 2.97%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind these change a lot depending on your industry, PPC competitiveness, 0-click searches, etc...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a scraping tool&lt;/strong&gt; like Screaming Frog to extract the following data from all your web pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old Headline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delete all the pages that aren’t meant to rank on Google. Then, head over to Google Search Console and extract the following data for all the web pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CTR (28 Day Range)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avg. Position&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add all of this data to a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, check what your competition is doing and use that to come up with new headline ideas. Then, put them in the &lt;em&gt;Title Ideas&lt;/em&gt; cell for the respective keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each keyword, come up with 4-5 different headlines, and implement the (seemingly) best title for each article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you implement the change, insert the date on the &lt;em&gt;Date Implemented&lt;/em&gt; column. This will help you keep track of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, wait for around 3 - 4 weeks to see what kind of impact this change is going to have on your rankings and CTR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the results are not satisfactory, record the results in the respective cells, and implement another test for the following month. Make sure to update the &lt;em&gt;Date Implemented&lt;/em&gt; column once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Step #8 - Keep Track of Rankings &amp;amp; Make Improvements On-The-Go&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re never really “done” with SEO - you should always keep track of your rankings and see if there’s any room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wait for an adequate time-frame after publishing a post (6 months to a year) and you’re still seeing next to no results, then it might be time to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what this usually looks like for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit the content&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your content have an adequate word count? Think, 1.5-2x your competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the content well-written?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the images in your article add value? E.g. no stock or irrelevant images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the content optimized for SEO? Think, keyword density, links to external websites, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit internal links&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the content link to an adequate number of your other articles or web pages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the article linked to from an adequate number of your web pages or blog posts? You can check this on Search Console =&amp;gt; Links =&amp;gt; Internal Links. Or, if you’re using Yoast or RankMath, you can check the # of internal links a post has in the WordPress Dashboard -&amp;gt; Posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit the backlinks&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have as many backlinks as your competitors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your backlinks from the countries you want to rank in? If you have a bunch of links from India, but you want to rank in the US, you’d need to get more US links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your links high quality? More often than not, low DA / PA links are not that helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you disown low-quality or spam links?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit web page&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the web page load too slow? Think, 4+ seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you enable lazy loading for the images?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you compress all images on the web page?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...And that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you guys had a good read and learned a thing or two :) HMU if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

One hack I’ve found is when I have a personal connection to someone I’m trying to sell to and they give me a warm introduction, I almost always close. Unfortunately, I have a limited network, so I struggle to find people who can introduce me to potential customers.”- *Account Executive at Software Company*

**Market Background**

Life is about who you know, not what you know. Whether that old adage resonates with you or not, I think we all can agree that your personal network is a powerful thing.

Before we get too deep, let’s first define two key terms we’ll be using a lot, warm introduction and finder’s fee. A warm introduction/referral occurs when person A introduces person B to person C. Typically, person A’s intro includes a recommendation of person B. A finder’s fee is the same as a warm introduction, but person A is compensated financially for doing so.

Here are some interesting stats published by Hubspot about the warm introduction -

* Buyers are 5x more likely to engage when they’ve been introduced to a salesperson in advance
* 84% of B2B decision-makers start the buying process with an introduction
* Referral leads convert 30% more than leads from other channels

While it’s clear that warm introductions work, it’s unclear how many companies have formalized a finder's fee program or are even giving incentives for warm introductions. This leaves room for innovation and opportunity. Let’s take a look at some major players.

**Major Players**

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

* Founded in 2002
* Roughly 16,000 employees
* Acquired for $26.2B

[Eventbrite ](https://www.eventbrite.com/)

* Founded in 2017
* Roughly 700 employees
* Raised $557.3M

[Hopin](https://hopin.com/)

* 2019
* Roughly 130 employees
* Raised 171.4M

*Note: These companies don’t specifically focus on solving the warm introduction problem, but they are majors players helping people network with one another and find connections.*

**The Opportunity**

Getting a warm intro can be challenging. First, you need to be well-connected, become well-connected, or leverage someone who is well-connected. Next, you need to endure the awkwardness of asking someone to risk their social capital to open a door on your behalf.

On the other side, the person making the connection needs to allow you to leverage their network, give the introduction (thus using their social capital), and unless there's a finders fee, they get nothing in return.

Here’s the idea - create a way to turn people’s social capital into cash. One way to do this is to build a marketplace to facilitate the buying and selling of warm introductions. On one side, you have people looking for warm introductions to specific companies, departments, and people. On the other side, you have people willing to make warm introductions to those companies, departments, and people for a fee.

For those seeking warm introductions, the marketplace solves the problem of having to build a network/find a person with a network and make an awkward ask. Conversely, the person giving the warm introduction is now rewarded monetarily for using their social capital on giving those introductions.

**Current Solutions**

* [Bravado](https://bravado.co/opportunities/intros)
   * Bravado brands itself as a community for sales professionals, but in Oct of 2020, they launched Warm Intros. This feature allows people to pay for introductions. This is very similar to the idea mentioned above, but, they are only focused on facilitating intros to B2B software engineering departments. **Also, this is the only solution that I’ve found that directly addresses the problem.**
* Private Online Communities (Slack, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc…)
   * There are thousands of networking groups that exist on platforms like Facebook and Slack. I can say from experience that some of these are great and others are junk. They can be effective ways of getting introduced to people who would otherwise be inaccessible, but you still face all the challenges listed above.
* Conferences
   * These are arguably the most effective ways to meet high-quality individuals and form lasting personal relationships. That said, the pandemic has left all conferences canceled, and even before that they were generally pretty expensive. Also, while these may be effective methods to grow your network you still have the challenges outlined above.

*Note: I did find three companies,* [*Just Mention*](https://justmention.co/)*,* [*Wintro*](https://www.wintro.io/)*, and* [*Finders Crowd*](https://finderscrowd.com/)*, that provide a solution for facilitating warm introductions. When trying to sign up for their services, I either couldn't get in or they didn't have any active deals. This tells me they are still in development or aren't in business any longer.*

**How to Execute**

If I were building this business, here’s what I would do -

* **Pick a Niche:** There are many different verticals and industries that this idea could apply to - which is a good long term. To start, rather than offering intros for any use case, I’d focus on a specific niche industry. This will make it easier to find relevant people on both sides and build the marketplace. One industry is venture capitalists and founders. I found dozens of articles talking about the difficulty of getting warm intros to VC.
* **Start with a Directory**: With two-sided markets, typically you need to make a hard decision on which side to build first. I’d scrape the web looking for companies who already offer finders fees and create a directory for a niche. You’ll easily have seeded one side of your market with little to no effort. Then you can focus on building your connector side.
* **Focus on Quality &gt; Quantity**: One of the challenges (which I’ll talk more about below) is sourcing high-quality customers on both sides. I’d implement a vetting process prior to accepting intro requests, or people claiming they can fulfill requests. This will keep bad actors out, and help you build a strong, reputable brand. Look to how freelance marketplaces vet their users - there is probably a lot of overlap.
* **Build a Community:** Because acquiring customers will be a challenge, I’d recommend taking a page out of Bravado’s playbook and creating a community. This will help you get high-quality, like-minded people together. If you provide value in the community, selling them on making introductions for each other will be much easier!

*Pro-tip: Rather than build a marketplace from scratch, check out* [*Sharetribe*](https://www.sharetribe.com/)*, an affordable white-labeled marketplace tool. This should make creating an MVP relatively easy.*

**Challenges**

I’m going to preface this section with this - I think this is a tough business to build, but could be massive if you get it right. Rather than list *all* the challenges, I’m going to give you what I consider the top three:

1. **Two-Sided Market:** Innately, two-sided markets are just harder. You have two different value propositions that you need to get right, two times the customer segments to grow, and this usually means two times the headaches. The upside is if you get it right, it makes your business valuable and defensible.
2. **High-Quality Connections/Asks:** A critical factor in getting this right is making sure you have great customers on both sides. If you have low-quality people asking for intros or connectors who can’t actually deliver on those intros, then your business will fall apart quickly. A review system could help increase customer retention rates and ensure the platform is healthy.
3. **Disintermediation:** People may try to circumvent your platform and go directly to the companies paying the finder's fee - resulting in you getting cut out of the deal. The best way to prevent this is to add enough value to both customers that cutting you out isn’t worth the lost value. Financial protection, quality guarantees, and smooth transaction processes are all great value propositions to keep your customers on your platform.

I am hoping for some advice/guidance for having someone take over a mostly built website.

,Entrepreneur,"Hello folks,

my family runs a business focused on car adaptations for disabled people in Europe. We are established in our country,  operating for more than 50 years,  have around 40 employees and approx. €4 Mio in annual revenue. So basically a small to medium enterprise. My father indicated that I will have to make a decision within the next 3 years if I want to become actively involved in the company.  Otherwise he will have to sell it. My problem is that I am very very undecided about it since I as the following aspects will show.

&amp;#x200B;

**Upside**

\- Established business long-term (recurring) customers 

\- Interesting field with social aspect 

\- Niche market with limited threat for new entrants

&amp;#x200B;

**Downside**

\- Revenue growth maxed out

\- Contribution margin is decreasing due to supplier pressure &amp; higher wages

\- Prices cannot be increased strongly, due to fierce price competition 

\- Mostly purchasing products from partners / competitors &gt; limited own product range

&amp;#x200B;

**My main question**

I am not sure if i am asking myself the right questions to make this decision. I am unsure how this industry will evolve in the long term (30+ years) as I don't want to put all my cards in this basket bearing in mind that it seems like the 'juicy' years have passed. To me it seems as one would have to make the processes as lean as possible to be successful or innovate more (which is currently quite limited in my opinion).

I am unsure how this industry will evolve in the long term (30+ years) as I don&amp;#39;t want to put all my cards in this basket bearing in mind that it seems like the &amp;#39;juicy&amp;#39; years have passed. To me it seems as one would have to make the processes as lean as possible to be successful or innovate more (which is currently quite limited in my opinion). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Has someone faced a similar situation of taking over his / her family business and can relate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hi,

The weather is getting worse here in Canada and COVID restrictions are once again increasing so I'm dreaming from my office. I've always wondered about something like this.

I work the gold mining industry doing geological data consulting. I've been on my own for about three years now. Currently, about half of my work is in Canada and the other half is in Latin America. Almost all of my clients are Canadian mining companies. The majority of my work is from my computer at home; although, I do week long site visits quite frequently (when the world is normal, that is).

I don't have any strong ties to Canada at the moment. I'm single and I don't own any property. I have my consulting company set up here and I have money in that account as well as a personal account and that's about it. It would possibly be fun to uproot for a while and go live somewhere else as long as I could travel back to visit my family every couple months.

Would it be possible to setup my consulting company in a Caribbean country with more favorable tax laws, live there and continue to do the same kind of work? Any resources with regards to this would be fantastic. Basically, I have my contact network. Would these (mostly Canadian companies) be able to retain my services and send the payment to XYZ Geological Panama without any implications for either of us?

In the last year, I've looked at over 1,000 businesses this year (not exaggerating), which has helped me develop a keen understanding of what makes a GREAT business and what makes a not-so-great business.

I thought it would be interesting for the members of this community to hear about a business that I've chosen to purchase so you can learn from our process:

In this thread, over time I will share:

1. how I found the business
2. what I like about this particular company
3. how we will finance and pay for the company
4. (after we buy it) how we plan to grow it
5. and results of our growth experiments

# This is the first post, so here are the High-Level details of the company I'm buying

* Industry - Landscaping
* Revenue - $6M
* EBITDA - $1M (Earning Before Interest Tax Deduction and Amortization)
* Client Type - Mostly commercial, some residential
* Date of Founding - 1990

# Why are we buying this business?

**We have a few simple ideas for investing:**

* we like businesses that we think will be around for a **long time, ideally forever.** People LOVE plants! Plants make people happy, so we don't think landscaping businesses are going anywhere in the next 50 years (unlikely to be ""disrupted"").
* we like **simple companies** that you can explain to your grandmother. Landscaping definitely fits that category.
* we like businesses with some type of **recurring revenue.** People need their lawns mowed every couple of weeks, so even if the world's financial systems melt-down, this business will keep going.
* we like businesses with **limited competition**. Each landscaping business competes only with a few local providers, which are usually mom &amp; pops operations.

Earlier this year, I had a potential client of my tech startup make me an acquisition offer.

We were still at a very early stage with product development and had only been around for nearly 2 years as a business with a super basic MVP.

,Entrepreneur,"All entrepreneurs want to be successful, but relatively few have done the work to know what that means.  In my work with entrepreneurs, one of the first things I look for (and if it doesn't exist, help them create) is a clear vision of what, specifically, would constitute success *for them*.  This vision, and the creative tension that having it creates, is an effective foundation of changing a business, and a life.

Here's how it works: 

Picture a rubber band. A big one, loose, about a foot in width and five feet in length. Picture it wrapped around your waist like a hula hoop.

Now picture something you want, which is not currently a part of your life. Something you want to build, something you want to be, something you want to have. Maybe you want your company to be the dominant company in the market. Maybe you want to be debt-free. Whatever it is, picture yourself having that thing. Like Michael Jordan, visualize yourself having what you want, as if it’s already real.

Got the image? Good.

Now remember that rubber band wrapped around your waist? Wrap the other end, in your mind, around the waist of your visualization, so that you have a taught, stretched rubber band, with one end wrapped around your waist in the here and now, and the other end wrapped around yourself when you have what you want. Feel the tension of the rubber band, the way it pulls the two versions of yourself together. Feel that tension in your body, your mind. Feel it’s texture, the way it yearns for resolution.

This is Creative Tension, which is one of the most powerful tools in a creator’s toolbox.

I’ve found visuals like the above to be helpful in creating this tension, but not always necessary. In essence, the minute you are clear about your vision, when you really feel what it would be like to have it and embrace that you want it, the fact that you don’t already have it creates Creative Tension.

We as humans hate tension. It’s uncomfortable, and everything in us wants to relieve that tension. Mostly, we choose to relieve that tension in the easiest, most straightforward way, which is to sacrifice on what we want. Be “realistic” about it. If our vision was to be the market leader, and that creates a ton of tension, maybe we change our vision to only being 10% bigger. It’s more “attainable,” which is another word for comfortable. You can almost see the slack being created in that rubber band when you lower your goals like that.

But there’s another option, which is to live with the discomfort. To stick to our vision for ourselves, the crazy, audacious one that scares us, even though the creative tension feels yucky. We can even do crazy things like repeat that vision to ourselves every day, burning it into our consciousness and not allowing it to be diluted. We can scare ourselves with our audacity to recreate that tension every day.

If we do this, if we refuse to dilute our vision, there’s only one option to relieve the tension. To take the actions necessary to get what we want. To be that market leader. To eliminate our debt. Doing anything else feels yucky.

People who wake up at five in the morning to exercise (raises hand) don’t do so because they’re disciplined. They wake up at five in the morning to exercise because they’ve cultivated a vision of themselves as one who exercises, and because of the clarity of this vision it feels better to wake up than to sleep in. Waking up and exercising relieves the tension.

Humans hate tension. I do, and you do. As creators, we can use this fact to drive radical change in our lives, if we’re only willing to be a little uncomfortable.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys - I thought I’d post today to tell you a little bit about my story. Hopefully, you’ll get something from it; not because we’ve done everything right or had no struggles, because who doesn’t, but because we’ve come out the other side and are growing every day!

For context, in January my business partner and I launched a link-building company called *Link City.* In our first month, we hit £5k in revenue - enough to pay my wage. In our second month, this increased to £7.5k and further to £10k in March. And then COVID hit…

I finally had some traction after years of trying and it was ripped away.

Our clients told us we’d have to put our campaigns on pause, so we were back down to £0 in revenue. Being a new company, we didn’t know where to turn - we had no support from the government, and I had to quickly think of a way to bring money back in in order to put food on the table.

With my SEO experience, I managed to pick up some consulting work which led me into stumbling into somebody that needed content writing. I had no choice but to take the opportunity - I was in a sink-or-swim situation, after all. My business partner was focusing on his own contracts but luckily found a solid writing gig, bringing that client with him to our new business. 

Fast forward to June: we had to write about 150,000 words a month.

So, what has this taught us?

# Cater to Demand

My first brand, *Link City*, was my baby. I was emotionally attached to it - and I was so hyped for the success we were seeing… so when we lost our clients it crushed me.

I had two options: sell a service that businesses clearly thought they could cut; or sell something that was in-demand. To be slightly more specific - we didn’t just write content, we wrote **optimised content** using Surfer SEO, to affiliate marketers. 

These marketers were still growing; local businesses weren’t. So, we doubled down on targeting affiliates and it worked… it allowed us to boom, and FAST. If you didn’t pivot quickly at the start, you were probably going to struggle…

# Sink or Swim

If you keep throwing sh\*t at a wall, something will stick. Seriously, I don’t think you can hustle and hustle and not find success. At some point you will find yourself an opportunity and when you do, grab it by the horns and don’t let go. 

# Don’t Get Hung Up On the Competition

This was a major roadblock for me. There are hundreds upon thousands of content writing services out there - so what would make me unique? How could I possibly start one from scratch and establish myself in the market?

Through branding. I found my USP - I niched myself as the Surfer-SEO-optimised Content Writing Guy, who had an edge in focusing on Affiliate Marketers.

I’m not a great writer, this post has gone through my quality and analysis team to ensure it's easy to consume. So it would take me longer to write and I would have to proof everything / correct a lot of mistakes. 

# Build Stability

We knew that stability was essential. So how could we achieve it? 

We took on two big contracts for three months, at a discounted rate. This gave us freedom to **ensure wages were paid**, but gave us the capacity to find more work and grow the business. 

Of course, it’s stressful to work on content where there’s no short-term earnings, but it was a good play - it was the right play. It gave us stability, humility, and some really good case studies! 

# Maintain Focus 

After we had some stability, we were really tempted to bring *Link City* back and make it better than ever. We took on some lower-maintenance clients, giving us extra money to plug into marketing for My Content Pal. After a few months, we let these clients go and focused purely on MCP. 

The man that chases two rabbits catches none, after all…

But the challenges were far from over, because in September…

# It Got Overwhelming.

In September I had a bit of a breakdown, in honesty. 

Given the nature of our clients and the fact they’re scattered all over, I had questions popping up at all hours - including 3-5 in the morning with our US-based clients. My Facebook messenger was constantly full of business-related messages; my Skype and Slack went off constantly. I couldn’t get away from it.

Naturally, having this messy work/life mix led us to make mistakes. The quality of our product slipped - our processes underwent heavy refinement, and at times our team didn’t feel like a team. One writer labelled it as a “content mill” - she wasn’t wrong. 

**Mental Health**

In June and July I worked all day, all night. I worked through lunch and dinner. I felt fine most of the time, but out of nowhere I’d have crashes - anxiety, depression, tiredness. They kept getting worse; each one lasting longer and taking longer to dissipate.

I took 3 weekends off over the last few months - they were hard resets for me, they were **essential.** I had weird physical symptoms at this point - even having ultrasounds and tests for unexplained lumps.

Of course, the lockdown didn’t help. I’d broken two bones on separate occasions during this period too - but that’s another story!

I had to make some changes - for the good of my mental wellbeing, and the good of my company. The two are linked…

* I split up with my girlfriend
* I focused hard on my mindset - I stopped beating myself up and realised I was doing my very best
* I started meditating - would recommend to any business owner 
* I worked on my communication - I’ve got a long way to go as a manager and as a person.

**A ‘Content Mill’**

There was a lack of a team ethos. We hired so many people so fast, there wasn’t enough time to add a structure or build any meaningful rapport. Your staff are just as important to have a good relationship with as your clients.

This lack manifested in our output: in tracking the number of words written a week, we noticed an exponential decline for about 2-3 weeks. Of course, this was amplified by the pandemic and local lockdowns. Our team was becoming depressed - we had to intervene. 

We sent out employee feedback forms and asked for their honest opinions. It was brutal; a shock. But it was necessary for us to see that we’d unintentionally let a toxic work environment grow. Not even to just help our business but to be a good person. Don’t be the reason people are miserable. 

So, I paused everything on my schedule and phoned each writer one by one - I spoke to them as people. Not as writers. 

**New Team Structure**

At this time, we had a few full-time writers, and a large group of freelancers. The team had around 60 writers in total. Massive, right? 

So, we streamlined a little. We split them into smaller groups, hiring three team managers - one for each group.

Writers found it daunting to ask questions in our original group channel - and who wouldn’t with 60 people you don’t know?

With the new structure, my managers were the next point of contact for questions, queries, and advice. They’d check in on campaigns, prepare them, and talk to me about team-specific or repeating problems. This helped so much!

We also added a Plugin, called *Donut*, which helped to build coworker friendships by pairing writers up for a morning coffee. I even created different channels: we have the DJ room, where writers can share their current playlists; we have Recipes &amp; Cooking, where people can chat about their food faves. 

We’re actually doing so well that we’ve got an online chess tournament organised after realising we all loved the Queen’s Gambit. 

I’ve learned that taking the time and effort to cultivate a healthy work atmosphere is **essential** \- it improves productivity, output, and the relationship with your team. Even more, it’s just a nice thing to do to provide some joy in such bleak times. 

**New Feedback Process**

Gone are the days of messaging a writer, with cumbersome lists of feedback and improvements. We became much more specific - we made sure there was a defined list of actionables, *and* that there was a positive message in there too.

With this in mind, I also learned that there’s no point in being anything other than **to the point** \- only say something’s good if it is. Or your message can get lost / overlooked. 

I'd recommend anyone building a business/brand to reach out to your customers. I would organise zoom calls / build rapport wherever I could. 

**Talk To Your Customers**

Even if the client wasn’t so keen on it, I'd still push it. To give you an example I’ve got one client who would reply with 1-3 word answers all the time. Very dry, virtually no brief but was always happy with the content we provided and kept paying us good money. 

Let’s call him Clint… If Clint wasn't a customer from the earlier days in the company, we would probably refuse to work with him. If you do not provide a thorough brief after being asked - we won’t work with you. Briefs are in your best interest- they give our writers the info they need to provide the quality content you deserve. 

Clint is probably just an exceptionally busy business owner so I’m conscious of not soaking up his time. Still, if he messaged me on a Saturday morning, I'd send him a picture of me walking up a hill. 

Bizarre? Maybe, but it seems to be working.

I've not lost a client yet, I’ve doubled some of my clients’ budgets and I’ve had quite a few referrals. 

My response time is getting slower though… it's certainly not a scalable tactic and probably contributed towards my moments of being overwhelmed. 

But I think it helps that **I actually enjoy talking to my clients and building friendships** essentially… I’ll end up meeting some of these guys at conferences down the line. 

# Find Your USP

After the wealth of growth we’d seen, we were still finding more pain points.

The first one was formatting and uploading content. A few of our larger clients hated this aspect, and wanted a service that could do it all. As a result, we built a graphics and affiliate team for our larger clients. It’s one of the best things we’ve done!

Moreover, we saw a need for keyword research (KWR). Even though it was trickier to implement, it’s made us around £60,000 over the last few months and has attracted a couple of **huge** clients. 

So, our USP is as easy as: *KWR + Content + Upload.* Take the time to find yours. 

Let's say you do copywriting too - you could be the funny copywriter or the technical copywriter who focuses on specific industries. 

# Find Your Customers

I knew affiliate marketers were my focus. So I purchased a few courses in affiliate marketing just so that I could get access to their private groups. It was a great move for My Content Pal.

I then commented, helped answer questions and built rapport wherever I could. 

# Never Underestimate Networking 

I messaged around 20-30 people a day, trying to build a rapport. I’d mention I sell SEO-optimised content, planting the seed whilst never trying to make it grow immediately…

After a while, they’d ask me for my help - and I’d be able to pitch!

If the conversation died off, I’d leave it for a few days and then try to re-ignite. Soon enough, people recognise your name popping up and the rest works out from there.

You know how you often get random friend requests from the Forex guy or the Dropshipping guy on Facebook? Their bio message often says what they do and their statuses are just sales, sales, sales. 

Don’t be that guy. Nobody likes that guy! 

It got to the point where our rapid growth became interesting enough that other high-profile brands and individuals in the community paid attention to our story. As a result, we have a few different initiatives in the pipeline ready to go, drip-fed over the next few months.

This would likely take us to over a million words a month, maybe more. This would be insane for My Content Pal’s growth, right?

So, moral of the story? Keep going - everything goes somewhere. 

Thanks so much for reading. 

I’m by no means an expert and I’m learning things the hard way but if you have any questions please feel free to ask, I'd be happy to help! 

PS. I’ve no courses to sell Lol.",t2_hccaj,False,,0,False,We Built a Six-Figure Company for The First Time (In a Pandemic),[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jx1v0q,False,dark,0.85,,public,40,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,40,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605817919.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys - I thought I’d post today to tell you a little bit about my story. Hopefully, you’ll get something from it; not because we’ve done everything right or had no struggles, because who doesn’t, but because we’ve come out the other side and are growing every day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, in January my business partner and I launched a link-building company called &lt;em&gt;Link City.&lt;/em&gt; In our first month, we hit £5k in revenue - enough to pay my wage. In our second month, this increased to £7.5k and further to £10k in March. And then COVID hit…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally had some traction after years of trying and it was ripped away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our clients told us we’d have to put our campaigns on pause, so we were back down to £0 in revenue. Being a new company, we didn’t know where to turn - we had no support from the government, and I had to quickly think of a way to bring money back in in order to put food on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my SEO experience, I managed to pick up some consulting work which led me into stumbling into somebody that needed content writing. I had no choice but to take the opportunity - I was in a sink-or-swim situation, after all. My business partner was focusing on his own contracts but luckily found a solid writing gig, bringing that client with him to our new business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to June: we had to write about 150,000 words a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what has this taught us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cater to Demand&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first brand, &lt;em&gt;Link City&lt;/em&gt;, was my baby. I was emotionally attached to it - and I was so hyped for the success we were seeing… so when we lost our clients it crushed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had two options: sell a service that businesses clearly thought they could cut; or sell something that was in-demand. To be slightly more specific - we didn’t just write content, we wrote &lt;strong&gt;optimised content&lt;/strong&gt; using Surfer SEO, to affiliate marketers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These marketers were still growing; local businesses weren’t. So, we doubled down on targeting affiliates and it worked… it allowed us to boom, and FAST. If you didn’t pivot quickly at the start, you were probably going to struggle…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sink or Swim&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep throwing sh*t at a wall, something will stick. Seriously, I don’t think you can hustle and hustle and not find success. At some point you will find yourself an opportunity and when you do, grab it by the horns and don’t let go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Don’t Get Hung Up On the Competition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a major roadblock for me. There are hundreds upon thousands of content writing services out there - so what would make me unique? How could I possibly start one from scratch and establish myself in the market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through branding. I found my USP - I niched myself as the Surfer-SEO-optimised Content Writing Guy, who had an edge in focusing on Affiliate Marketers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a great writer, this post has gone through my quality and analysis team to ensure it&amp;#39;s easy to consume. So it would take me longer to write and I would have to proof everything / correct a lot of mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Build Stability&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew that stability was essential. So how could we achieve it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took on two big contracts for three months, at a discounted rate. This gave us freedom to &lt;strong&gt;ensure wages were paid&lt;/strong&gt;, but gave us the capacity to find more work and grow the business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s stressful to work on content where there’s no short-term earnings, but it was a good play - it was the right play. It gave us stability, humility, and some really good case studies! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Maintain Focus&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we had some stability, we were really tempted to bring &lt;em&gt;Link City&lt;/em&gt; back and make it better than ever. We took on some lower-maintenance clients, giving us extra money to plug into marketing for My Content Pal. After a few months, we let these clients go and focused purely on MCP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man that chases two rabbits catches none, after all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the challenges were far from over, because in September…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;It Got Overwhelming.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September I had a bit of a breakdown, in honesty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of our clients and the fact they’re scattered all over, I had questions popping up at all hours - including 3-5 in the morning with our US-based clients. My Facebook messenger was constantly full of business-related messages; my Skype and Slack went off constantly. I couldn’t get away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, having this messy work/life mix led us to make mistakes. The quality of our product slipped - our processes underwent heavy refinement, and at times our team didn’t feel like a team. One writer labelled it as a “content mill” - she wasn’t wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June and July I worked all day, all night. I worked through lunch and dinner. I felt fine most of the time, but out of nowhere I’d have crashes - anxiety, depression, tiredness. They kept getting worse; each one lasting longer and taking longer to dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took 3 weekends off over the last few months - they were hard resets for me, they were &lt;strong&gt;essential.&lt;/strong&gt; I had weird physical symptoms at this point - even having ultrasounds and tests for unexplained lumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the lockdown didn’t help. I’d broken two bones on separate occasions during this period too - but that’s another story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to make some changes - for the good of my mental wellbeing, and the good of my company. The two are linked…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I split up with my girlfriend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I focused hard on my mindset - I stopped beating myself up and realised I was doing my very best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started meditating - would recommend to any business owner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked on my communication - I’ve got a long way to go as a manager and as a person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ‘Content Mill’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lack of a team ethos. We hired so many people so fast, there wasn’t enough time to add a structure or build any meaningful rapport. Your staff are just as important to have a good relationship with as your clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack manifested in our output: in tracking the number of words written a week, we noticed an exponential decline for about 2-3 weeks. Of course, this was amplified by the pandemic and local lockdowns. Our team was becoming depressed - we had to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sent out employee feedback forms and asked for their honest opinions. It was brutal; a shock. But it was necessary for us to see that we’d unintentionally let a toxic work environment grow. Not even to just help our business but to be a good person. Don’t be the reason people are miserable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I paused everything on my schedule and phoned each writer one by one - I spoke to them as people. Not as writers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Team Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, we had a few full-time writers, and a large group of freelancers. The team had around 60 writers in total. Massive, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we streamlined a little. We split them into smaller groups, hiring three team managers - one for each group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writers found it daunting to ask questions in our original group channel - and who wouldn’t with 60 people you don’t know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new structure, my managers were the next point of contact for questions, queries, and advice. They’d check in on campaigns, prepare them, and talk to me about team-specific or repeating problems. This helped so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also added a Plugin, called &lt;em&gt;Donut&lt;/em&gt;, which helped to build coworker friendships by pairing writers up for a morning coffee. I even created different channels: we have the DJ room, where writers can share their current playlists; we have Recipes &amp;amp; Cooking, where people can chat about their food faves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re actually doing so well that we’ve got an online chess tournament organised after realising we all loved the Queen’s Gambit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that taking the time and effort to cultivate a healthy work atmosphere is &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt; - it improves productivity, output, and the relationship with your team. Even more, it’s just a nice thing to do to provide some joy in such bleak times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Feedback Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days of messaging a writer, with cumbersome lists of feedback and improvements. We became much more specific - we made sure there was a defined list of actionables, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that there was a positive message in there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I also learned that there’s no point in being anything other than &lt;strong&gt;to the point&lt;/strong&gt; - only say something’s good if it is. Or your message can get lost / overlooked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend anyone building a business/brand to reach out to your customers. I would organise zoom calls / build rapport wherever I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk To Your Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the client wasn’t so keen on it, I&amp;#39;d still push it. To give you an example I’ve got one client who would reply with 1-3 word answers all the time. Very dry, virtually no brief but was always happy with the content we provided and kept paying us good money. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s really brilliant honestly and I didnt realize how easy it all actually was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Id like to get started too but Id love to hear everyone else’s stories on how they got started, how they decided what to sell, how they vetted suppliers, lessons you may want to impart or warnings/advice that I must know. Would really appreciate the help! :)&lt;/p&gt;

The Magic of Thinking Big by David J. Schwartz
 
 
If you desire a good life, a life where your dreams become part of your reality, you must think big. Thinking big is the premise of David J. Schwartz bestselling book, The Magic of Thinking Big: The True Secret of Success–How to Earn More, Lead Fearlessly, and Live a Happier Life.
 
 
“Look at things not as they are, but as they can be. Visualization adds value to everything. A big thinker always visualizes what can be done in the future. He isn't stuck with the present.”
 
 
 
 
The Premise Of The Book
 
 
The Magic of Thinking Big teaches exactly what the title proclaims: the importance of thinking big. From Schwartz’s perspective, our successes depend largely not on our intelligence but on our thinking capacity. 
 
 
“The thinking that guides your intelligence is much more important than how much intelligence you have.”
 
To create the life you want, you have to upgrade your thinking. You have to start thinking big. How do you start thinking big? How do you upgrade your thinking capacity and therefore your goals and your life? 
 
 
David J. Schwartz’s book outlines various effective strategies that can help upgrade your thinking, dreams/goals, and life. This book summary discusses the most profound lessons learned from The Magic of Thinking Big:
 
 
 
 
Lesson 1: Believe In Your Success
 
 
Believing in yourself and in your capabilities is the most profound lesson learned from The Magic of Thinking Big. As David Schwartz points out:
 
 
“Believe it can be done. When you believe something can be done, really believe, your mind will find the ways to do it. Believing a solution paves the way to solution.”
 
 
When you believe in your abilities, which means having a positive, can-do-attitude towards life and its many challenges, the result is an improved ability to find solutions to problems and the courage to take action in spite of fear. 
 
 
Always think success instead of failure. When you believe big, when you believe you are not your circumstances and are capable of directing your life, your thinking capacity improves. As Schwartz points out, 
 
 
“Think you are weak, think you lack what it takes, think you will lose, think you are second class - think this way and you are doomed to mediocrity.”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 2: Excuses and fear will doom you to a mediocre existence
 
 
Most of us are very fond of making excuses for our failures. Schwartz calls this Excusitis, the failure disease.
 
 
“…You will find that the more successful the individual, the less inclined he is to make excuses. The fellow who has gone nowhere and has no plans for getting anywhere always has a bookful of reasons to explain why. Persons with mediocre accomplishments are quick to explain why they haven’t, why they don’t, why they can’t, and why they aren’t…”
 
 
To upgrade your thinking and life, you must stop making excuses or letting fear keep you from taking action. How do you do that? How do you stop making excuses or letting fear and negative thinking control you?
 
 
David J. Schwartz offers the law of cause and effect as the ultimate solution. As he points out:
 
 
“Accept the law of cause and effect. Take a second look at what appears to be someone’s “good luck.” You’ll find not luck but preparation, planning, and success-producing thinking preceded his good fortune. Take a second look at what appears to be someone’s “bad luck.” Look and you’ll discover certain specific reasons. Mr. Success receives a setback: he learns and profits. But when Mr. Mediocre loses, he fails to learn.”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 3: Use The Power Of Positive Thinking
 
 
“Whether the psychological problem is big or little, the cure comes when one learns to quit drawing negative from one's memory bank and withdraws positive instead”
 
 
When negative thinking becomes habitual, our emotions are largely negative. David Schwartz illustrates the need to be cautious with the words we use to communicate with others as well as with ourselves. 
 
When you use negative words, the mind translates that into a negative mental movie that then influences how you feel and act. When you use positive words, the result is a positive mental picture. 
 
“The point is this: Big thinkers are specialists in creating positive, forward-looking, optimistic pictures in their own minds and in the minds of others. To think big, we must use words and phrases that produce big, positive mental images.”
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
Believe in your success, teach yourself how to deal with fear and excuses, and become a positive thinker. 
 
 
 
I hope that was useful, have a great day!

My days off are not guaranteed, my commute is minimum of an hour each way and am overall so stressed out that even on my days off I rarely do get, I find myself in a bad mood dreading the start of a new week. I’m still young only 25 years old and have been doing this for 3 years now. Before I started in law enforcement I had my own business and have continued to manage it and keep it going as much as I can while working my law enforcement job. I won’t get into specifics but my business I’m in would fall under a type of home improvement/service.

Here’s where thinks make my decision hard. I’ve recently been diagnosed with cancer and although I’m okay now after surgery there is a chance it could come back and I have steady doctor follow ups and tests every few months.

Recently I’ve been wanting to pull the trigger and leave more then ever as I have a business opportunity to open a storefront for a extremely affordable price. I do believe making this move could only increase business. 

Basically it’s, stay with my current job and get the benefits and money of both and live a miserable life waking up going to a job I hate everyday but be extremely comfortable money wise.

,Entrepreneur,"I have been researching for days and for the life of me I can not figure out an answer to this question. I started an Art's Collective in Brooklyn. I curate spaces and experiences for queer artists of color through different parties and events that are both physical (when safe) and virtual. Through my events I give opportunity to local DJs, musicians, and other performing artists to get paid and showcase their work while also using that entertainment to provide a safe space for other queer POC's to enjoy themselves and network with people like them. Currently all my energy goes into one specific party/event I curate monthly that is specifically designed to double as a fundraiser where proceeds are donated to different charities and foundations that serve our community.  


 
Virtual versions of this event are free and revenue comes from donations. Physical events are ticketed, but are also live streamed. Revenue comes from ticket sales as well as donations made from those who watch online. I fund the cost of putting on the events and send the money raised to charities that were pre-selected. This specific event is will always be a fundraiser. However, I am in the process of extending the roster of events we produce under the Art's Collective name and expanding into other parties and events that include music, culture, fashion, comedy etc. These events will still be produced with the explicit intention of curating space for queer people of color and giving platforms to artists, but they will be for profit events and revenue will not be donated to charity.  

 

Some of those profits will help produce the original event, but I ultimately want to be able to support myself comfortably off of this event curation (and be able to pay the 3 other artists who have come on to help produce the events). All that being said, what am I? Am I a non-profit? Am I an LLC? A mentor who works in nightlife and music has expressed confidence in me being able to grow this brand and has told me I need to establish the business as a legal entity - most importantly because I need to separate the Collective's revenue from my personal money. But I just have no idea what to file as.

Currently all my energy goes into one specific party/event I curate monthly that is specifically designed to double as a fundraiser where proceeds are donated to different charities and foundations that serve our community.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual versions of this event are free and revenue comes from donations. Physical events are ticketed, but are also live streamed. Revenue comes from ticket sales as well as donations made from those who watch online. I fund the cost of putting on the events and send the money raised to charities that were pre-selected. This specific event is will always be a fundraiser. However, I am in the process of extending the roster of events we produce under the Art&amp;#39;s Collective name and expanding into other parties and events that include music, culture, fashion, comedy etc. These events will still be produced with the explicit intention of curating space for queer people of color and giving platforms to artists, but they will be for profit events and revenue will not be donated to charity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those profits will help produce the original event, but I ultimately want to be able to support myself comfortably off of this event curation (and be able to pay the 3 other artists who have come on to help produce the events). All that being said, what am I? Am I a non-profit? Am I an LLC? A mentor who works in nightlife and music has expressed confidence in me being able to grow this brand and has told me I need to establish the business as a legal entity - most importantly because I need to separate the Collective&amp;#39;s revenue from my personal money. But I just have no idea what to file as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard conflicting recommendations so I am here to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey what’s up everyone!? I’ll keep this short and sweet. I recently ran Kickstarter for an instrument I created called the TheoryBoard. 

I raised $1,013,783 using primarily Facebook and Instagram Ads (along with pushing out PR and a little bit of influencer work). I screen captured the entire process. I just finished editing all 10 videos. 

I just uploaded the fifth video in the series. I plan on releasing the rest periodically during the month of November. They are free, I am just pushing some positive info back into the community.

,Entrepreneur,"Had the idea for a better way for independent artists to get their music heard about three weeks ago. It actually struck me as I was browsing Hacker News and saw a similar idea posted. Looked into it, people in the comments were raving about how something like this was needed but that the site posted wasn't very user friendly. I thought I could do a much better job in terms of UX by combining the initial concept (independent artist discovery) with another idea I had several months ago but never really pursued (discovering new music by swiping left/right on songs, like Tinder).

I mocked up some designs, posted them on my Twitter, and was almost instantly hit up by an independent artist talent agency interested in driving traffic to my app in exchange for some sort of partnership. I was shocked as it was barely a thing yet, just some mock-ups and an idea, but we talked over Zoom and stuff and it really inspired me to keep going with it.

I then grinded for two weeks building it out, thinking about core features, discarding the rest. Was inspired a lot by Y Combinator's Startup Schools videos about how it's preferable to launch as quickly as possible, to just get something out there and see if people want it.

I finished up right on time and **launched (**[**https://disco.so**](https://disco.so)**)**:

   * Got retweeted by the co-founder of a startup I was and currently still am working at

   * Probably got &lt; 5 from that, not much attention
* Got retweeted by that talent agency
   * Probably got another 10 or so sign-ups, mostly artists
* Posted on various music-focused Discord servers
   * Probably got a solid 20 or so sign-ups from there, people were very receptive
* Posted on [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/jskgtu/i_made_an_app_for_you_to_share_your_music_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [small](https://www.reddit.com/r/30secondvibes/comments/jsfi6y/i_made_an_app_called_disco_a_place_for_you_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) music-focused subreddits
   * Got the *vast* majority of sign-ups from this (50+)
   * Very well received, made sure to sound as humble and non-sales-y as possible and it worked

I received quite a few messages of just pure support which I made sure to showcase a little bit on my Twitter. It was such a beautiful feeling, having a complete stranger just message me about how much they believe in the idea and how excited they are to see it grow.

I immediately began setting up user interviews to better understand the problem space. I interviewed two artists who unsurprisingly found out about the product through my Reddit posts and gathered some incredible feedback which I'm implementing now.

**Lessons learned:**

* Launch as quickly as possible
   * It's said quite a lot, but for good reason. I think two weeks is a solid amount of time to spend on an MVP where if it doesn't work out, you haven't really lost much and can pivot to something else; at worst you have a cool side project to talk about in job interviews and stuff
* Tailor your messaging to the specific channels you're posting to
   * I made sure not to just copy/paste the same spiel on all the channels I launched on
   * In the Discord servers I manually typed out the message for each server to make sure it sounded as authentic and human as possible
   * On the subreddits I made sure to emphasize why I was posting to those subreddits and aimed to be as clear as possible
   * On Twitter I made sure to keep things short and sweet and utilized threads for longer spiels
* Validate, validate, validate
   * One of the reasons I really went all-in on this is because the idea was really born out of validation
      * People were commenting on a very similar product and how something like it was needed
   * That talent agency who hit me up just added fuel to the validation fire
   * Post launch, people were very receptive and it showed in the results: less than 24 hours after I made all those posts, the initial private beta limit I set (100 users) was already maxed out and the waitlist was just growing every day (currently at 46 sign-ups)

Moving forward, I'm going to absolutely continue talking to users, especially listeners/non-artists to figure out how to best cater towards them as the product is almost like this two-sided marketplace of artists and fans. I've also set another two week deadline for myself to launch the new features and bug fixes I'm working on. I've applied to several accelerators and early stage funds but I'm not sure how that'll pan out. I can survive off of my savings until next summer where I have an internship lined up, but that'd be cutting it real close and it'd be nice to get some funding (\~25k) as (1) it'd be a fairly decent vote of confidence, and (2) the money would really just help with living expenses and not having to worry about surviving the next year.

I've also been thinking a lot about building out a team. I'm just one guy working on this right now which is obviously unsustainable for the growth I'm looking to achieve. Currently the app is built on pure web technologies as it's what I'm best at, but a dedicated mobile app would be most ideal. I've looked into React Native but it's already quite different in terms of the ecosystem that I would spend most of my time learning how to deal with React Native than actually building product. So I'm thinking that if I'm going to build a dedicated mobile app, I should do it the ""best"" way which would mean going full native. I have next to no experience with native mobile development, though, which means I'll have to hire.

My **questions for the community** mainly revolve around the things I've mentioned above:

* How should I go about funding, if at all?
   * I feel reasonably confident that I could start generating revenue with either the next iteration or the iteration after that through a monthly subscription that an artist pays in exchange for two ""boosts"" that guarantee that artist appearing in a user's ""stack""
   * But I don't think the revenue from this will be enough to be able to full-on hire a mobile dev (most likely iOS first, Android later, though I really want to support both out of the gate, it seems unlikely)
   * The accelerators have yet to get back to me but it's been less than a week for the majority I've applied to and I'm fairly sure I'll get at least one interview; hopefully that goes well
* Should I keep the app in a ""private beta"" stage and just increase the maximum user count gradually?
   * I see some value in the product being ""exclusive"" and having to get an invite to join or whatnot, but at the same time the product kind of needs a lot of users to be valuable for both artists and fans
   * I've already announced to the people on the waitlist that I'll be increasing the max user count to 500 in two weeks when I push out the new features, but should I just go back on that and say I've thought it over and open it to the all?",t2_7rc5fljs,False,,0,False,"Went from idea to MVP in two weeks, 0 to 100+ users (and waitlist sign-ups) in &lt; 24 hours; some thoughts on what worked &amp; why along with some questions on how to move forward (x-post from /r/startups)",[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jxc4rg,False,dark,0.6,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605851471.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had the idea for a better way for independent artists to get their music heard about three weeks ago.

I have an industry specific online directory that I’m in the process of developing and I am trying strategize how best to monetize the platform. As a new start up with zero traffic I need to give particular consideration to NOT creating barriers for customers or vendors as traffic and subsequent brand recognition is what will fuel growth in the early stages.

That said, I’m considering a few options:

1. Vendor paid listings - vendor maintains a subscription to keep their listing on the directory. I don’t like this idea as it limits vendor sign ups and stunts growth, in-turn less reliable for customers. How have other subscription businesses overcome this? Free intro periods? Great sales/BD people?

2. Vendor premium listings - Free basic listing but vendors can pay to get better online real estate. This doesn’t really match up with the ethics of the idea which is to partner the customer with the best vendor.

3. Vendor commission based - Vendors create a free listing and only pay when an online lead is converted offline and is based on a reconciliation process. This will rapidly increase vendor sign-ups (as nothing to lose) needed to build a bigger directory which creates reliability and credibility amongst new customers.

4. Customer subscription - customers pay to access the platform. Either monthly or as needed basis. This would limit customer traffic. How would is be possible to make it free to begin with and add a fee later? How have other start-ups achieved this?

,Entrepreneur,"Hi,

I would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions:

**Business Model**: Selling low-maintenance wood plastic composite fences online (no installation)

We already have a warehouse that prepares the orders for us in a different state. They also do the installation but that is not our goal at the beginning. 

**Vision**: Create a system that sells without hiring/building Sales Teams. We will have a customer service team and chats available. What we are looking for is to create a website to allow customers to build orders within minutes. Basically, we will start with just a few colors (best-sellers) and a handful of modifications that can be made. Tesla sells cars within 5 minutes - I figured, we can sell fences for your home online. 

**Challenges**: 

1) How to build a website that allows creating a custom order as mentioned above? Where to host it? 

2) How to accept $10k+ payments without paying &gt;5% in fees? 

\- we can accept a deposit only and get paid via wire transfer before shipping out the product. That could work too.

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model&lt;/strong&gt;: Selling low-maintenance wood plastic composite fences online (no installation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have a warehouse that prepares the orders for us in a different state. They also do the installation but that is not our goal at the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a system that sells without hiring/building Sales Teams. We will have a customer service team and chats available. What we are looking for is to create a website to allow customers to build orders within minutes. Basically, we will start with just a few colors (best-sellers) and a handful of modifications that can be made. Tesla sells cars within 5 minutes - I figured, we can sell fences for your home online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) How to build a website that allows creating a custom order as mentioned above? Where to host it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) How to accept $10k+ payments without paying &amp;gt;5% in fees? &lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Greetings,

&amp;#x200B;

My father started a couple years ago a transport company (heavy carrier, 40 tons trucks).

I left my warm job in corporation and I joined him, took my license and start driving those monsters.

As a small company, you kinda never get to work directly with final customer, you always had a middle company, a shipping company.

&amp;#x200B;

I soon realised that in order to be more profitable, I must expand the activity and start doing both things.

I made all the legal arrangements and I moved from steering wheel back to desk.

Honestly, at first, I didn't had too much experience but it was pretty easy to figure out how the things works. You negociate with the customer for a price and give like 85-90% of that to the carrier. Risks are involved both ways but at bottom line you don't have too many expenses.

The competition for clients (like in any other business) is extremely agressive but i'm trying to figure out a plan to be more attractive to customers in order to move their freight.

So, why I made this post:

&amp;#x200B;

1) First of all I would like any feedback from anyone since i started doing this with 0 experience.

2) I would love to hear how this business works in other parts of the world (my company is in Eastern Europe).

3) Any idea or practices to reach out customers, at this moment i'm building a network on Linkedin and I will try to reach people.",t2_2i43xjyn,False,,0,False,Freight Transportation Company,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'How to Grow'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_jx0lsz,False,dark,0.67,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},How to Grow,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605811706.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings,&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

I'd like to help some friends and think of how they can win the clients, they are looking for. They studied Architecture and Interior Architecture.

**My advice is:**

1. Focus on one segment / target group: houses/appartements that need to be renovated! Don't try to acquire hospitality or office projects anymore... Target group: private, wealthy people, who are willing to spend &gt;$25k, because the profit on all the &lt;5k projects is too small. They have the skills to fit the needs of the (lower) luxury segment.
2. Develop a unique and on point corporate identity and build a fantastic website and brochure.
3. Sell like Hell.

My question is, how and where can they find their potential clients? Do wealthy people who plan to renovate their houses google search? I don't think so. Do they search for inspiration on instagram or Pinterest? Can Linkedin be a place to meet them? Do wealthy people search for consultants online, via books or just via personal referral? I don't know.

**Ideas:**

\- research a few hundred of real estate agents that fit the profile and contact them

\- try to win awards and get published in magazines/books (PR)

\- visit premium interior fairs and network (Salon Mobile, etc.)

Mainly I'm wondering how the hell the payments and stuff work. I know the whole process is probably too complicated for one thread, but I had a few general questions. 

Would you specify hourly rates of employees on the proposal or just a general number? As in, if you got a contract for year worth $1million, does your proposal simply list that number or does it say ""I need 5x engineers @ 100/hr"" (or whatever adds up to that total minus the other fees).

Then when you as the company get paid, is it all in a lump sum and it's up to you to pay the employees whatever hourly you gave them (say 50-60/hr each), then keep the rest for the company?

,Entrepreneur,"Hi, I'm a 19 y/o planning on starting my own e-commerce website which can host multiple vendors from my own home town, kind of like amazon but at a much smaller scale.

My suburb consist of a population of about 30,000, there's a huge physical marketplace with a whole variety of shops and stores, quite urban in my opinion.

But since the past few years I can't help but notice how most (if not all)  the businesses here don't truly have an online presence except for social media accounts for advertising their goods/services.

I see a huge gap that I think can fulfil by introducing a website that brings the whole market together by providing a place for all the vendors and customer to come onto and interact.

This idea can be attractive to both the vendors and their customer:

* for instance, the business owners want to expend their business by any means and beginning with an online presence is a great way to gain more exposure and leads because my business will provide them exposure and enable them to sell their products online without worrying about the whole tension of worrying about finding a platform and customers and then getting their products delivered.
* what's in it for the customers is that they get to purchase whatever they want from whichever shop they prefer the most at the comfort of their home and get it delivered to them for a minimal delivery fee.

I'm planning on making money by charging a certain amount of monthly operating free and also taking about a 5%-10% cut from their sales through my website, meanwhile using the delivery fee to cover the cost of delivery itself.

,Entrepreneur,"I made a big mistake.

It was at the end of December of 2019 and I started working right away on my idea. A platform to send newsletters.

I spent six months working on it, every day, from Monday to Sunday until I had an MVP. I was very proud of what I created and I wanted to share it with the world.

The results: Zero clients.

I was expecting people to try it, at least, out of curiosity or to think about using it. But no one did.

Is the project a failure because I have zero clients?

1 - The site only had around 4K visits so far, that's not enough.  
2 - 99% were visits from places like Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, BetaList, etc. Are they my clients?

I have two big reasons to consider this a failure:

**I still need to put six or twelve more months**.

My two biggest competitors are ConvertKit and Substack.

When I look at these two solutions, I prefer the one I created. It's easier and simpler to use. And I like that.

ConvertKit is adding more and more features, so that's beyond want I wanted to create. And Substack is simpler but I found it a bit confusing. And they take around 10% of what you make.

**The problem is...**

Substack has more features. Paid newsletters, static pages, a better writing editor, and other things. If I want to create those I need to spend at least another 6 months. Or more!

And for what? Adding more features is not going to help with finding clients, because they won't see them.

**Finding Clients**.

I am sure that you can make a lot of money from a service like this. TinyLetter is going to disappear someday and Substrack charges a lot to have paid subscribers.

The problem is, if I code, I can't do sales or marketing. It seems to me that there are at least 3 full-time jobs to do at the same time and that's too big for me.

I was naive when I started.

**What was my big mistake?**

I wanted to create a Micro-Saas. I wasn't looking to be a big company. I thought to have 500-1000 clients and make 10/20K per month.

I wanted to create a family business. Pay salaries for a couple of people and flying low. I didn't want to be the greatest entrepreneur.

My big mistake was to think that creating a SaaS business was easy. At least, easier. I was expecting to have 50/100 clients in the first couple of months. I thought: ""Internet is big, they will come"".

And there is some truth to that, but I learned after that you need and go find them. Or spend money on ads. Or both.

And I don't know how to do it and I don't have a budget for that or the experience.

**What do I mean by ""I quit""?**

When I said that I quit, I meant: big projects that keep me attached to my desk for years and infinity hours. Projects that you can never say: done. A SaaS is never done.

If you are starting today, you should start small. You need to learn first. Starting by creating a SaaS is too big and risky in time, money, and effort.

Last week I created and launched a small project. It took me a week to create it. It had some visits and no sales, but it doesn't matter. No risks were taken, and very little effort.

And that's why you should think about quitting too. You should quit trying to create a big project or even Micro-SaaS. I think that the ""micro"" doesn't reflect the effort that you need to put in anyway.

So, I quit creating big projects and everyone who starts should do the same.

Create something small in less than a month and try to sell it. You will see how hard it is and how many people tell you: ""nice! I will take a look later"" And they will never do. So then you learn, and you keep trying small things until you have enough experience.

Even enough experience to realize that creating a SaaS is NOT for you. Like I learned.

**Know yourself and your goals**

I started this to be free. And being free involves, of course, having more money.

But how much?

There are two things that we should acknowledge: the ideal and the good enough.

If I dream big, the ideal would be around 10K per month. That's a good amount of money but nothing too crazy. But I did the maths, I don't need more. Plane tickets, hotels, travels, mental peace, rent in a nice place, beautiful food and restaurants, and saving some money, of course.

I don't want to buy a fancy car or a big house. With that amount of money, I will be rich for my lifestyle.

But, there is also the good enough. And it is around 5K per month. With that, I can do pretty much the same things but less often. Like if I travel to New York and I want to stay there for a month I can't, but I could do it for a week. Things like that.

**Do I need to create a SaaS for that?**

Probably not. The problem with a SaaS is that I was giving my freedom away by doing things that I wasn't enjoying. I like to create. But I didn't like spending every single hour of the day adding more features and at the same time trying to find clients.

If that's what you want, that's fantastic, go ahead and start a SaaS. But that's not what I wanted.

I romanticized the idea of travel and writing. And that's what I want. I wanted to make money to write, to share lessons on the things that I think are valuable for people to have a better and more balanced life.

*Know yourself.*

If I wanted to write. Why was I spending my time creating a SaaS?

**What's next for me**

I realized thanks to the [article](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/after-losing-38676-as-an-indie-hacker-i-cant-do-it-anymore-i-quit-8673223598) I published on Indie Hackers that I may not have to create a SaaS to start living the life I want.

People paid me for it and I made a good amount of money. It paid my rent for the month, and that blew my mind.

So I decided:

* To only create small projects that take between one week and a month.
* Learn more about launching products, hoping to help other people avoid my struggles.
* To start a newsletter to share my learnings from past and future experiences.

The newsletter is called [Balance](https://joseleon.substack.com/). The first one is about the effects of writing a viral article (it went to the front page of Hacker News) and I will send it next Sunday.

Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!",t2_10xzjq,False,,0,False,After Losing $38676 I Decided to Quit Entrepreneurship and This is Why you Should Consider it Too,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Lessons Learned'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_jx3oln,False,dark,0.45,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Lessons Learned,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605825082.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at the end of December of 2019 and I started working right away on my idea. A platform to send newsletters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent six months working on it, every day, from Monday to Sunday until I had an MVP. I was very proud of what I created and I wanted to share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results: Zero clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting people to try it, at least, out of curiosity or to think about using it. But no one did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the project a failure because I have zero clients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 - The site only had around 4K visits so far, that&amp;#39;s not enough.&lt;br/&gt;
2 - 99% were visits from places like Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, BetaList, etc. Are they my clients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two big reasons to consider this a failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still need to put six or twelve more months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My two biggest competitors are ConvertKit and Substack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at these two solutions, I prefer the one I created. It&amp;#39;s easier and simpler to use. And I like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ConvertKit is adding more and more features, so that&amp;#39;s beyond want I wanted to create. And Substack is simpler but I found it a bit confusing. And they take around 10% of what you make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substack has more features. Paid newsletters, static pages, a better writing editor, and other things. If I want to create those I need to spend at least another 6 months. Or more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for what? Adding more features is not going to help with finding clients, because they won&amp;#39;t see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Clients&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure that you can make a lot of money from a service like this. TinyLetter is going to disappear someday and Substrack charges a lot to have paid subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, if I code, I can&amp;#39;t do sales or marketing. It seems to me that there are at least 3 full-time jobs to do at the same time and that&amp;#39;s too big for me.&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hello. I don't know if these type of questions is appropriate but here I go.

I'm 21 yo CS student in middle east. I got into game development (software) 3 years ago and last year I got accepted into an ""entrepreneur center for game developers"" I don't know the real word for it. Basically they give you free office, free equipment and networking opportunities so you can form up a company and make digital games.

So I did and we are currently 5 person team, 3 programmer and 2 artists working for almost 6 months together. While we worked those 6 months we didn't get paid for any of it, basically it was trying to learn together to work as a team and make some game prototypes to attract game publishers.

Recently we found a publisher that wants to work with us, so we are now forming a company. It's going to be equal equity for all 5 members, 20% each of us.

My main doubt is that deciding for something that requires all of us to come together might be hard in the future. Even though we get along really well and everybody is reasonable, my goals for the future are a bit different from the team. For example, I want to switch to making PC games as soon as possible even if other areas are more profitable, so you can see I'm not much of a business person.

I've been recently searching in the internet and there are varying opinions about having partners. So I thought maybe I'd share my specific condition and get your thoughts on it.

Do you think should I go along with this decision or are there better alternatives?

Deep Work by Cal Newport
 
 
 
 
If you are looking for a book that will drastically shift your way of thinking regarding getting stuff done, Deep Work by Cal Newport is the book for you. 
 
 
 
 
The Premise of the Book
 
 
Would you like to know the formula for success in your life? The secret is ‘Deep Work’, a concept introduced in Cal Newport’s bestselling book “Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World”.
 
 
 
Deep work is “the ability to exercise extreme concentration on important activities that help you achieve your personal and professional aims, and to perform these activities fast and effectively.” The ability to perform deep work is so important to your success—and to all success for that matter—that Cal Newport describes it as a superpower.
 
 
To quote Cal Newport,
“What we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore—plays in defining the quality of our life.”
 
 
To utilize the concept of deep work, you also need to be aware of shallow work, the opposite of deep work. Cal Newport defines shallow work as tasks of less importance or that have no real impact on your productivity. 
 
 
Engaging in shallow work (instead of deep work) is a productivity killer that will see you only appear to be productive with nothing to show for it. When a large portion of your day’s work consists of shallow work—emailing, meetings, social media, etc.–the results are reduced productivity and ineffectiveness in your undertakings.
 
 
“If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.”
Cal Newport
 
 
The premise of Deep Work is that when you start scheduling uninterrupted periods of work into your daily work routine, you will experience increased focus on the things that matter the most to you, and an immense amount of productivity, motivation, and grit. 
 
 
Here is a summary of the key lessons you can expect to learn from reading and implementing the productivity strategies discussed in Deep Work. Cal Newport’s book provides the following strategies as the best way to perform deep work:
 
 
 
 
Lesson 1: Engage in deep work
 
 
Here is the secret to productivity: “to become productive, you have to commit to being productive; you have to commit to doing productive work. To perform deep work and get into a state of productive flow, create habits and rituals that make you effective and productive. 
To get into deep work, whenever you have an important task to complete, one that is productive and helpful to achieving your aims, immerse yourself in monastic work by creating distraction-free work periods—you can work in 25-minute blocks (Pomodoro technique) and dedicate as many as four hours to deep work per day or week). 
Cal Newport puts it this way: “If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you're taking away time you could be spending on higher-impact activities. It's a zero-sum game.”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 2: Create routines around your success and completing deep work
 
 
Cal Newport puts it this way “The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transform into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.”
 
 
Jim Ryun once said, “Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.” Therefore, to get into a state of deep work Cal Newport was referring to above, your routines or habits must be complementary to “unbroken concentration” or deep work.
 
 
The best way to turn your work into routines and habits is by scheduling blocks of deep work into your daily work routine. The more focused you become, the more deeply and productively you will work. To create deep work routines, embrace “scheduled timeouts from social media” and keep at bay all manners of distractions—consistently checking your phone, email, online videos, etc.—by batching similar tasks into an effective routine. Aim to work through all tasks and problems in blocks of time and to develop the ability to discern the important from the not so. 
 
 
“To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli.”
Cal Newport
 
 
 
 
Conclusion
 
 
This summary doesn’t discuss everything that Newport talks about but the concept he talks about is literally life changing if implemented. But to summarize it all; start scheduling your time appropriately, first to tasks that matter and engaging in deep work, and then to other, less important things, shallow work. That is how you shall master your time and achieve personal and professional success.
 
 
As Cal Newport even points out:
 
 
“Treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. This type of work is inevitable, but you must keep it confined to a point where it doesn’t impede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact.”
 
 
I hope that was useful, have a great day!

,Entrepreneur,"Platforms don't care about you (or your brand)

They care about the money you give to them.

They will eventually keep decreasing your reach to the audience you built. Why? Because they can, and they don't want to show your posts to your audience, they want to show more ads to them.

The point of building an audience is to make them part of your ""community/brand/etc"", but if they don't see your messages, what's the point of building it?

So the earlier you realise that you need to build your own fort and get people inside it, the better results you'll see.

Some common/uncommon ways to build your fort:-
- Create an E-mail list:- Hit the ""send"" button and everyone in your list will get that mail, now atleast it's their choice if they want to open it or not.

- Create a WhatsApp Broadcast:- You remember all those SMS's we used to get from different companies? I feel WhatsApp can replace that. If done in a non-annoying way, you can reach to everyone who choose to subscribe your ""Broadcast List"".

- Use Discord:- Discord is like one powerhouse to keep your community alive.

“Well, there are two completely different (unrelated) classes of Indian immigrants.

***Not-so-educated communities***, mostly Punjabi entrepreneurs, that is who you see with all the convenience-stores and gas-station-owners. These guys migrated in the 60s and 70s and brought family with them, they are very business-like and support each other.

***Engineers etc*** who are recent first-gen immigrants who are non-business folks, mostly South-Indian. These are the folks who generally stay away from each other, stay away from business etc that I described. We wouldn't even think of pooling money for anything. In fact I guess I can even extend this correllation ""back home"". There are plenty of less-educated families who support each other and spin up businesses, but the professional working classes seem to prefer living in isolation, almost to the point of not knowing who your extended family is beyond a cousin or two”

\[End Quote\].

In a nutshell they loan money/support each other. Sure a single man with no family support CAN be successful however it is TEN TIMES easier if a family becomes an entrepreneur. While Lonely Luigi is slaving away, uncle Bob of the Punjabi family hires or loans money to his Nephew and then he later earns enough money to buy a franchise. (ie the stereotype of Punjabis owning gas stations/minimarts). I am Italian American myself. We USED to be a lot like the Punjabis in NYC we owned delis or in San Francisco we owned fishing boats and would share/pool money. However as the generations passed we stopped doing what worked, became office workers/lawyers, moved to the suburbs, Now like our American counterparts we are atomized “wantrepreneurs” who struggle in silence as our businesses fail. This is COMMON among WASP America as well.

During the customer consultations you should present your original business idea. 

How does the consumer satisfy these needs now? 
How often do they purchase, where, what purchase criteria do they use?
How much do they spend, how satisfied are they currently?
Does your business idea offer added value? 
How much (i.e. what is the consumer willing to pay for it? Does it seem realistic? 
What changes could enhance its value?  How strong is their interest?


The businessperson consultations should be used to obtain their perspective (potential suppliers, distributors and competitors all represent   good interview candidates).     The consultation  should focus less on the product itself (don’t ask them the same questions as the consumers) and more on the broader issues facing you as an entrepreneur (for example: what are the key challenges facing you (i.e. the student) with respect to your business startup, business operations and overall business viability?  what advice does the entrepreneur offer in addressing them?).

,Entrepreneur,"I had an incredible call with a new client last week, and she said something that stuck.

""I wasn't actually sure what you did, because I mostly see you talking about podcasts."" Which was fantastic feedback, because I feel like I talk about funnel design a lot. (I also talk about my podcasts a LOT.) However, she's pretty new to my audience, so it's a good barometer for how I'm doing.

I could have gotten defensive about this. But I value curiosity. So I did some research. And, as a matter of fact, a check of my Notion tags indicates that I talk about funnel development less than 18% of the time these days.

Whoops. 🤷🏽‍♀️

That could be a problem when it's the thing that pays my bills.

And it's likely to be even less than that in the near future, because I've been working on putting out regular content about rituals and joy, which obviously has nothing at all to do with funnels.

So, how do you keep people interested in buying when you do lots of things???

You have to develop throughlines.

If you're not familiar with the term, it's the connecting plotlines or themes in a book or film. In TV, we often call them ""mythology"" episodes, versus throwaway ""monster of the week"" episodes.

I use the word mythology deliberately, because it's EXACTLY what you want to cultivate.

If you do a lot of shit, you are going to need a whole lot more touchpoints than the average business. I can come into contact with 7-10 iPhone ads, and know pretty definitively that I'm buying a phone. Actually, in this case, I probably only need 2-3 ads.

But if you are a personality-driven business, or have a large suite of products or offers, then you have to constantly work on telling the story of who you are and what you do over the long term.

This ALSO means that the majority of your customers are going to be long tail. They aren't going to buy from you until they've been in your orbit for at least three months. In fact, an estimated 80% of a single product business's customers come between the 3-18 month mark, and that number is undoubtedly higher for us polymath types.

Which means that you have to create your own personal brand mythology.

For me, that's pretty easy.

My personal story is inextricably linked to the work I do. I build systems because I had to learn them the hard way after my son’s death. So even if I'm talking about loss or joy, or systems that are unrelated to funnels, I can (and regularly do) tie them back to the work that I do.

That's harder to do if say, you build cars and rockets to Mars AND have ideas about microchips for the human brain.

But even Elon Musk has throughlines.

He regularly brings you back to the more unusual parts of his work, and makes you pay attention to what HE wants your attention on.

Admittedly, sometimes his tactics are bad, unless you enjoy being pursued by the SEC for fraud. But as a marketing tactic, they're occasionally pretty fucking brilliant.

And whatever else you may think of him, Elon has cultivated one the most well known brands of our time.

We know his name, what he does, and what motivates him.

That's a brand.

So, how do you do this with *your* funnel?

Well first, you gotta have a brand identity.

Mine is always slightly in development, but I have a logo, a color palette, and a couple of consistent fonts.

I paid and bartered for mine, so it's pretty refined now, but this is absolutely something you can DIY if you don't have one yet. Websites like Coolers will help you put together a color palette that doesn't suck, and you can pick fonts you like. Don't make it complicated.

The advantage to having a defined brand identity is that I can slap a specific shade of purple on something, use one of two fonts, add my logo somewhere, and I'm done. That automatically saves me a shitload of time.

Because even if it's got nothing to do with whatever else it is I'm doing, you visually know it's mine.

Next, you want some thematic elements.

This is different from your brand identity in that you can use your themes in a multitude of creative ways.

One of mine is Van Gogh's Starry Nights. I have a wall tapestry that hangs behind me in all my videos, and I use those swirls in a variety of places. I have a dress too, and next year I'm planning some branding photos wearing it. Then the association will be present every time you see my picture.

It's something that helps you fix me in your mind over time. And, because it's not unique to me, it's like free advertising. Van Gogh is everywhere, especially Starry Nights. And the next time you see it, you might just think of me.

Want another example of thematic myth-creation?

Netflix just released The Queen's Gambit, which is a masterpiece of storytelling. And one of the reasons is that it weaves in the visual elements of chess everywhere.

It's in the patterns of the hotel carpets. The bedspreads. Beth's remodeled home.

It's especially visible in Beth's clothes, which feature not a single flower—instead, she wears black, checks, plaids. In the closing sequence, she's wearing a white coat and a beret. She literally looks like a queen. (The piece, not royalty, although she looks pretty fucking regal here, too.)

All of these visual elements weave together the show's mythology so that it becomes a sensory experience.

And your throughlines should ALWAYS be a sensory experience.

It's in the sound of my voice. Starry Nights. The color purple in my photos.

And that's just scratching the surface—imagine what you can do with physical packaging or in-person events.

Tiffany blue tissue paper.

The smell of a specific essential oil or perfume.

High-end dark chocolates or coffee.

Chimes, fountains, or simply the quiet of the outdoors.

Look, your customers aren't stupid. They know you're selling something.

And as I keep saying, that means you can choose. You can choose between creating an emotionally predatory purchasing environment with conventional marketing tactics. Or you can design a sensory experience meant to entice and delight, based on awareness and consent.

&lt;p&gt;He regularly brings you back to the more unusual parts of his work, and makes you pay attention to what HE wants your attention on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, sometimes his tactics are bad, unless you enjoy being pursued by the SEC for fraud. But as a marketing tactic, they&amp;#39;re occasionally pretty fucking brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whatever else you may think of him, Elon has cultivated one the most well known brands of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know his name, what he does, and what motivates him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do you do this with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; funnel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well first, you gotta have a brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine is always slightly in development, but I have a logo, a color palette, and a couple of consistent fonts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paid and bartered for mine, so it&amp;#39;s pretty refined now, but this is absolutely something you can DIY if you don&amp;#39;t have one yet. Websites like Coolers will help you put together a color palette that doesn&amp;#39;t suck, and you can pick fonts you like. Don&amp;#39;t make it complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage to having a defined brand identity is that I can slap a specific shade of purple on something, use one of two fonts, add my logo somewhere, and I&amp;#39;m done. That automatically saves me a shitload of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because even if it&amp;#39;s got nothing to do with whatever else it is I&amp;#39;m doing, you visually know it&amp;#39;s mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you want some thematic elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is different from your brand identity in that you can use your themes in a multitude of creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of mine is Van Gogh&amp;#39;s Starry Nights. I have a wall tapestry that hangs behind me in all my videos, and I use those swirls in a variety of places. I have a dress too, and next year I&amp;#39;m planning some branding photos wearing it. Then the association will be present every time you see my picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s something that helps you fix me in your mind over time. And, because it&amp;#39;s not unique to me, it&amp;#39;s like free advertising. Van Gogh is everywhere, especially Starry Nights. And the next time you see it, you might just think of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want another example of thematic myth-creation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix just released The Queen&amp;#39;s Gambit, which is a masterpiece of storytelling. And one of the reasons is that it weaves in the visual elements of chess everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the patterns of the hotel carpets. The bedspreads. Beth&amp;#39;s remodeled home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s especially visible in Beth&amp;#39;s clothes, which feature not a single flower—instead, she wears black, checks, plaids. In the closing sequence, she&amp;#39;s wearing a white coat and a beret. She literally looks like a queen. (The piece, not royalty, although she looks pretty fucking regal here, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these visual elements weave together the show&amp;#39;s mythology so that it becomes a sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your throughlines should ALWAYS be a sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in the sound of my voice. Starry Nights. The color purple in my photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s just scratching the surface—imagine what you can do with physical packaging or in-person events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiffany blue tissue paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smell of a specific essential oil or perfume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-end dark chocolates or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chimes, fountains, or simply the quiet of the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, your customers aren&amp;#39;t stupid. They know you&amp;#39;re selling something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I keep saying, that means you can choose. You can choose between creating an emotionally predatory purchasing environment with conventional marketing tactics. Or you can design a sensory experience meant to entice and delight, based on awareness and consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but I know which I&amp;#39;d choose.&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

I recently started working on a service that is able to find and validate 200+ founder leads every week from recently funded startups. The report includes verified emails, LinkedIn profiles, company information, and funding data which makes it a very valuable tool to a variety of businesses and consultants for sending personalized email and LinkedIn outreach.

Normally for a project like this I would just blast the link all over the internet(ProductHunt, Hackernews, Facebook, IndieHackers, etc) and hope for the best but this time I was set on getting at least a few customers first. Having customers before launch lets you add good reviews, case studies, and other forms of ""social proof"" to your landing page which can greatly increase conversions when you get that big bump in traffic from the actual launch which I wanted to get the maximum advantage from.

So instead of doing a big open launch my website link became a closely guarded secret. I made posts on Facebook and LinkedIn in groups that I know would be interested but instead of posting the link I required them to message me with the details of what they would be pitching to the list as well as their experience with email outreach. The idea was that our perfect customer would be someone with a great offer for the list(something that matches perfectly with the needs of a growing startup) as well as the email outreach experience to get amazing results. We could then use those results as a case study for the list's effectiveness. But now after getting 5 customers in a single week I've found that this method can be seen as a sales technique in its own right and I'd like to share with you why.

Firstly, by requiring the potential customers to qualify themselves before being able to sign up it flips the sales experience on its head. The customer becomes the one trying to sell YOU on whether or not they can buy your product and this creates a sense of genuine scarcity in their mind that wouldn't otherwise be there if you had just posted the link to everyone at once.

Secondly, by getting the potential customer to message you before the link is sent they are now much more open to asking questions and engaging in a dialogue that can alleviate their doubts which raises their chances of buying significantly. From the experience of running multiple online businesses I can tell you that 95% of people don't read much of what is on a website. I get asked every ""frequently asked question"" from my website's FAQ section on a regular basis so being in chat conversation already while the potential customer skims through the site lets you catch their doubts and answer their questions quickly. Meanwhile if they had followed the link on their own they most likely would have just bounced with the question in their mind and never returned.

So obviously $400 MRR is nothing to brag about on this sub but I just wanted to share this technique as I kind of stumbled into it and have seen very interesting results with it. I definitely think its worth a shot if you have a compelling hook for your product that can get people interested enough to reach out to you for access.

TLDR: Exclusive, invite-only prelaunch can flip the script on the normal sales dynamic and be a super effective tool for selling to your target customers

Meanwhile if they had followed the link on their own they most likely would have just bounced with the question in their mind and never returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So obviously $400 MRR is nothing to brag about on this sub but I just wanted to share this technique as I kind of stumbled into it and have seen very interesting results with it. I definitely think its worth a shot if you have a compelling hook for your product that can get people interested enough to reach out to you for access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Exclusive, invite-only prelaunch can flip the script on the normal sales dynamic and be a super effective tool for selling to your target customers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If any of you have similar tricks or advice for launching I&amp;#39;d love to hear them as I&amp;#39;m planning on a full launch of this business fully in another week or two!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Anyhoo,

I have heard that one reason that many gas stations are owned by Arabs or South Asians is due to large familial networks that will support them. In the 1800's Chinese/Italians/Irish were like that as well. However it seems most americans especially Anglo america is very atomized and lonely and do not have that bond that many immigrant families have. (look at the opiod epidemic, drug abuse etc). Is one reason that businesses fail in america is because most people are too lonely and doing too much work? If you had an army of relatives supporting you would most businesses be doing better lol. A lot of yuppie types say: ""i want to be an entrpreneur bro!"" they either get into ""investing"" or set up some sports bar, vegan restaraunt or dopey smoothie shop that fails in a year or two. The Arabs/South Asians on the other hand seem to never have this problem and even manage to buy other franchizes such as Hotels or Gas stations. Since they have large familial networks they can hire out among their relatives. I am Sicilian american myself and we italians used to be a lot like the Arabs in the sense that we would stick together, support family and own delis/restaraunts. (We Southern Italians have some Arab admixture as well due to the Silk Road). However today most Italian Americans are indistinguishable from their Anglo counterparts and set up ""wantrepreneur"" businesses. It seems now most Americans are too individualistic (heck I can't even get my acquaintance to go out for some beers let alone manage a conveninence store with me lol).

,Entrepreneur,"I  summarized the COVID-19 advice of 5 founders/investors, hope it  helps. Also please give me some feedback on how we can improve our blog  posts and give you guys more value.

Jonathan Hung, a Co-Managing Partner (MP) at Unicorn Venture Partners (UVP) and also an experienced entrepreneur:

**Jonathan the COVID-19 outbreak and how it affects business**:   This is a new reality now which every business is impacted by. We   should be social distancing and at the same time trying to survive.   Jonathan is now sending e-mails to his portfolio companies asking about   their cash situation and a current plan (which is the most important!   Whatever their plan was in January or February it’s no longer the same   and many companies have had to pivot). The main difficulty is that «we   have no idea of when the bottom is» but we will have to come back to   normal some day (probably not until another 3-6 months). **Advice:**   If the company is just starting to raise money they should definitely   look at their valuations because they must have changed. The company  may  have to take down-rounds in order to survive. **Example:**   The valuation of one of UVP's portfolio companies, Lime, the electric   scooter rental company was 2.4 billion dollars a year and a half ago.   Now there are less  scooters on streets because they have taken them   away (because of social distancing) and a lot of people don't want to   use those scooters because of fears of contracting COVID. So you can’t   justify a valuation of 2.4 billion. Jonathan is hoping that it will not   fall to 400 million dollars as he was told. 

Adrian Druzgalski, a Co-founder and CTO at Radius Intelligence and a VP of Engineering at AirTM:

In  the current crisis our banks are fine so we do not have  fundamental  banking crisis. Adrian notes that there is still a lot of  room to see  what happens next, so we must wait a bit to see how things  develop. **Advice:**  As a suggestion to people who are  starting their companies right now  and want to fundraise, and just need  money right now to survive, and to  get their companies on their feet,  Adrian suggests not to give up and  keep trying to raise.He suggests to  try as many sources of funding  available. So if VC's do'nt want to fund  your company, try grants,  angel investors, traditional banks, private  equity, crowdfunding,  soverign wealth funds, friends and family etc.  This piece of advice  holds true even when there is no deadly pandemic  raging around the  world. **Advice 2**: One  more piece of  advice will be to learn to bootstrap for as long as  possible, if you are  unable to get funding. Many times it is very  attractive to raise money,  but being able to bootstrap in very creative  ways for as long as  possible and not having to reach out for money is  still Adrian’s number  one piece of advice to fledgling entrepreneurs.

Jason Scharf, the Associate Director at Illumina and a Co-Fund Manager at San Diego Angel Conference:

Speaking  of choosing one of the major sources of capital in order to  fundraise  nowadays. Jason states that generally speaking (and depending  on their  state) all of them work. However if you want to go to a VC you  need to  have a very clear position, vision, and plan. Especially  right now  you need to have a plan on how your business will navigate,  thrive, or  just survive during COVID and how it will succeed after  COVID, when  things have gone back to normal.To conclude he advises that  you need to  choose one of the sources and try it in order to understand  if it is  right for your company(especially right now). 

Phin Upham, the Managing Partner at Haymaker Capital:

Before  the COVID-19 outbreak there used to be a different level of  intimacy  between investors and founders: they knew each other in person  and  could meet. However now you already know them or you don't which is a   great advantage for people with a developed network. So currently Phin   mostly reinvests in companies he already knows and has only coompleted   one new investment. Fundraising during COVID: COVID has further   separated winners from losers. It is more difficult for people to build   new relationships, which means that those who had been doing well  before  are still doing well. The current situation is unfavorable for   companies with complex strategies or new companies. **Advice for early stage founders**:   The main goal is not to build more startups but to build good  startups,  so now is a great time for those who are very dedicated and  have some  new interesting ideas, that are able «add value» and  execute. 

Roberto Machado, the CEO at BetaBlocks and a member of Tech Coast Angels.

Robert believes that it is a tough moment to raise money because there is just less money out there. **Advice:**   Roberto highly recommends to be cautious and wise on how your company   spends its money, during COVID. He does not see getting better in the   short term, it is going to take some time for people to gain confidence   again.  In essence, he suggests to weather the storm and  not go  broke,  don't use your personal finances and assets, break the bank or  sell  your house in order to survive or you are going to be in  deeper   problems. Robert advises «When there's a storm just save energy. When   you come out of that storm. A lot of your competitors will be dead. So   you are gonna be hopefully in a better situation than before».",t2_7adsaolj,False,,0,False,How to survive COVID-19,[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jwlvxe,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605754743.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I  summarized the COVID-19 advice of 5 founders/investors, hope it  helps.

## The ten best sales books

## [1) Spin Selling by Neil Rackham](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SPIN%C2%AE-Selling-Neil-Rackham/dp/0566076896/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=spin+selling&amp;qid=1605524787&amp;sr=8-1)

📷

Based on 12 years of research and 35,000 sales calls, Neil Rackham distilled the lessons into a single powerful sales technique. It’s pretty simple and can be boiled down to a sales methodology where you just ask the right questions instead of focussing on closing.

* **S:** Situation
* **P:** Problem
* **I:** Implication
* **N:** Needs payoff

By asking the right questions you demonstrate empathy for the prospect, build trust and get to the bottom of what they want.

&gt;Successful people ask a lot more questions during sales calls than do their less successful colleagues. We found these less successful people tend to do most of the talking.

Situation questions are there to provide you with the background information you’ll need to properly assess the prospect’s needs. Problem questions are designed to get to the pain points of the prospect and the issues they face daily when trying to operate their business. They’re designed to get to the core needs of the prospect.

Implication questions are as the title would imply the consequences for the prospect of the problems. By asking them you want to impress upon the prospect that the problem(s) are significant and in need of being redressed.Needs payoff questions on the other hand focus the prospect’s attention on your solution. By asking these questions you get the prospect to understand that your solution can alleviate the problem and get them to parrot back the benefits.

## [2) Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion By: Robert B. Cialdini](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Influence-Psychology-Robert-Cialdini-PhD/dp/006124189X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Influence%3A+The+Psychology+of+Persuasion+By%3A+Robert+B.+Cialdini&amp;qid=1605526198&amp;sr=8-1)

📷

This classic sales book and New York Times Best Seller has sold over 3 million copies and been translated into thirty languages, not bad for a book that seeks to influence and persuade people.

The book can be broken down into six principles:

1. Reciprocity
2. Scarcity
3. Authority
4. Consistency
5. Liking
6. Consensus

Dr. Cialdini dives into each one with what they are, the power of each principle and real world examples of how they work to persuade and get something from people whether it be how the Hare Krishnas exploded their donations to this little gem from the chapter on reciprocity from a student of Dr. Cialdini:

&gt;About one year ago, I couldn’t start my car. As I was sitting there, a guy in the parking lot came over and eventually jump-started the car. I said thanks, and he said you’re welcome; as he was leaving, I said that if he ever needed a favor to stop by. About a month later, the guy knocked on my door and asked to borrow my car for two hours as his was in the shop. I felt somewhat obligated but uncertain, since the car was pretty new and he looked very young. Later, I found out that he was underage and had no insurance. Anyway, I lent him the car. He totaled it.

## [3) How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0091906350/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=How+to+win+friends+and+influence+people+By%3A+Dale+Carnegie&amp;qid=1605527314&amp;sr=8-1)

📷

&gt;So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

This is one of the first best selling self improvement books, it discusses how to use people’s desires and ego to move them to your advantage, it’s a classic of the genre and with the best title of any book on this list.

Part of persuasion and sales isn’t simply having the best pitch in substance but it’s about style too, to be able to flatter and move people with charm is a huge advantage over the charmless.

It describes the various techniques to get people to like you, how to handle people and win people over to your way of thinking and change people without giving offense or breeding resentment.

## [4) The Challenger Sale by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/0670922854/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Challenger+Sale&amp;qid=1605528059&amp;sr=8-1)

📷

Challenger sales were developed by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson in 2011, they looked through thousands of sales reps and found that there were five common profiles:

* **The Hard Worker:** A self motivated striver who puts in the work and loves feedback.
* **The Relationship Builder:** Is great at building a rapport with clients and is generous with the amount of time they give each prospect.
* **The Lone Wolf:** An independent type that follows their own instincts
* **The Problem Solver:** A reliable and details oriented type.
* **The Challenger:** Focused on the end goal, loves to debate and doesn’t mind pushing the customer out of their comfort zone

Out of these five profiles the challengers represented 40% of the top performing reps in Dixon and Adamson’s analysis.

Challengers win by understanding the way the prospect works and seeing the flaws and drawbacks and pointing out a better way, to get the prospect out of their comfort zone and see a new way of doing things. The challenger sales method is especially useful in complex sales situations where taking charge can be more beneficial in moving things along.

## [5) The Little Red Book of Selling by Jeffrey Gitomer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Red-Book-Selling-Principles/dp/1885167601)

📷

What are the 12.5 principles?

1. Kick your own ass.
2. Prepare to win, or lose to someone who is.
3. Personal branding IS sales: It’s not who you know, it’s who knows you.
4. It’s all about value, it’s all about relationship, it’s not all about price.
5. It’s NOT work, it’s NETwork.
6. If you can’t get in front of the real decision maker, you suck.
7. Engage me and you can make me convince myself.
8. If you can make them laugh, you can make them buy!
9. Use CREATIVITY to differentiate and dominate.
10. Reduce their risk and you’ll convert selling to buying.
11. When you say it about yourself it’s bragging. When someone else says it about you its proof. 1
12. Antennas up! 12.5. Resign your position as general manager of the universe.

This little book is a must read for entrepreneurs and business owners as it gives you a crash course into selling, from finding the decision maker to being able to pitch in a way that is both understandable and excites the guy who cuts the cheques.

The book is relationship driven, referral orientated and finding out what the core buying motives of the customer are and then taking the right actions to get the sale.

## [6) Predictable Revenue by Aaron Ross and Marylou Tyler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Predictable+Revenue+by+Aaron+Ross+and+Marylou+Tyler&amp;qid=1605531650&amp;sr=8-1)

📷

If you generate leads through outbound sales then Predictable Revenue is a must read for you. It provides a how-to guide to create a repeatable and scalable lead generation process without cold calling.

Instead of making cold calls to get in touch with prospects, they recommend sending cold emails to generate referrals to the decision-makers first, who then are likely to expect your call.

The next stage involves setting up the qualification call to figure out whether there’s a mutual fit between the prospect and sales rep, then from there you can focus on “selling the dream”. It’s a process that allows you to measure your effectiveness at every stage and then over time hone it to become a successful sales conversion machine.

## [7) How to master the art of selling by Tom Hopkins](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Master-Art-Selling-Hopkins/dp/0586058966/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=How+to+master+the+art+of+selling+By%3A+Tom+Hopkins&amp;qid=1605532257&amp;sr=8-1)

📷

Tom Hopkins earned himself over one million dollars in his first three years as a salesman, and he distills the lessons learned in this excellent guide to selling. He examines every stage of sales and selling, from sales calls to initial meetings, follow-ups and long-term strategies providing useful tools and tips to level up your sales skills.

He also goes into “money study”, the learning to earn fivesome which when mastered allows you to acquire new knowledge quickly and thoroughly.

1. Impact
2. Repetition
3. Utilization
4. Internalization
5. Reinforcement

Take impact for example the more you’re interested in a subject the more details you’ll remember about it and the better you’ll be able to talk about it. This applies in sales, if you can motivate yourself to master your pitch and speak with enthusiasm it’ll help you when dealing with prospects. If you can psych yourself up to learn you can do it more effectively and faster.

## [8) To Sell is Human by Daniel H. Pink](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sell-Human-Surprising-Persuading-Influencing/dp/1786891719/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=To+Sell+is+Human+By%3A+Daniel+H.+Pink&amp;qid=1605535083&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1)

📷

Everyone is always selling, you’re trying to move someone to do something that you want them to do. You’re selling them on it, and there are no natural born sales people. It doesn’t matter if you’re an extravert you can still be a terrible salesperson because you talk too much and listen too little, and if you’re an introvert you’re too shy and timid to close; ambiverts make the best sales people.

Daniel offers great exercises to hone your skills and tips to make your offering more clear from offering less choices to empathising the potential of the product, not the achievements. He also covers how to approach clarifying the motives of others so you can then proceed to move them in the direction you want.

## [9) Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Pitch+Anything+By%3A+Oren+Klaff&amp;qid=1605535587&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1)

📷

In this book Oren Klaff uses the latest developments in neuroeconomics to hack the brain and take advantage of how the brain reacts to make sure you stay in control of every stage of the pitch process.

The three processes to help you pitch and sell anything are:

Your pitch must speak to your audience’s neanderthal brain. Make yourself the prize. Use multiple so-called frames to trigger a gut decision in your favor

Let’s take number 3, there are multiple ways to create a gut decision such as a time frame i.e. we’re likely to sell out next month which creates a fomo (fear of missing out) reaction in the prospect.

## [10) Ultimate Sales Machine by Chet Holmes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Sales-Machine-Turbocharge-Relentless/dp/1591842158/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Ultimate+Sales+Machine+By%3A+Chet+Holmes&amp;qid=1605536132&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2)

📷

Chet Holmes was a selling master. He doubled sales for nine divisions of a Charlie Munger company, in the book he goes over the 12 key strategies you need to implement to succeed:

1. Effective time management
2. Instituting higher standards and regular training
3. Effective meetings
4. Becoming a brilliant strategist by taking a strategic approach by educating your prospective customers so that you set the buying criteria.
5. Hiring superstars.
6. Targeting your best buyers
7. The seven musts of marketing - You can't rely on just using one marketing method to attract new customers.
8. Better presentation skills
9. Winning the best buyers
10. Sales skills
11. Follow-up and client bonding
12. Goals and measures - Standard material done well.

It’s a really thorough book that focussed on continued action and maintaining focus in order to succeed in sales.

&lt;p&gt;Based on 12 years of research and 35,000 sales calls, Neil Rackham distilled the lessons into a single powerful sales technique. It’s pretty simple and can be boiled down to a sales methodology where you just ask the right questions instead of focussing on closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; Situation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P:&lt;/strong&gt; Problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I:&lt;/strong&gt; Implication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N:&lt;/strong&gt; Needs payoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By asking the right questions you demonstrate empathy for the prospect, build trust and get to the bottom of what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful people ask a lot more questions during sales calls than do their less successful colleagues. We found these less successful people tend to do most of the talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situation questions are there to provide you with the background information you’ll need to properly assess the prospect’s needs. Problem questions are designed to get to the pain points of the prospect and the issues they face daily when trying to operate their business. They’re designed to get to the core needs of the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implication questions are as the title would imply the consequences for the prospect of the problems. By asking them you want to impress upon the prospect that the problem(s) are significant and in need of being redressed.Needs payoff questions on the other hand focus the prospect’s attention on your solution. By asking these questions you get the prospect to understand that your solution can alleviate the problem and get them to parrot back the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

Cialdini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classic sales book and New York Times Best Seller has sold over 3 million copies and been translated into thirty languages, not bad for a book that seeks to influence and persuade people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book can be broken down into six principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reciprocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scarcity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consensus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cialdini dives into each one with what they are, the power of each principle and real world examples of how they work to persuade and get something from people whether it be how the Hare Krishnas exploded their donations to this little gem from the chapter on reciprocity from a student of Dr. Cialdini:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one year ago, I couldn’t start my car. As I was sitting there, a guy in the parking lot came over and eventually jump-started the car. I said thanks, and he said you’re welcome; as he was leaving, I said that if he ever needed a favor to stop by. About a month later, the guy knocked on my door and asked to borrow my car for two hours as his was in the shop. I felt somewhat obligated but uncertain, since the car was pretty new and he looked very young. Later, I found out that he was underage and had no insurance. Anyway, I lent him the car. He totaled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0091906350/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=How+to+win+friends+and+influence+people+By%3A+Dale+Carnegie&amp;amp;qid=1605527314&amp;amp;sr=8-1""&gt;3) How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first best selling self improvement books, it discusses how to use people’s desires and ego to move them to your advantage, it’s a classic of the genre and with the best title of any book on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of persuasion and sales isn’t simply having the best pitch in substance but it’s about style too, to be able to flatter and move people with charm is a huge advantage over the charmless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It describes the various techniques to get people to like you, how to handle people and win people over to your way of thinking and change people without giving offense or breeding resentment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Challenger-Sale-Control-Customer-Conversation/dp/0670922854/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Challenger+Sale&amp;amp;qid=1605528059&amp;amp;sr=8-1""&gt;4) The Challenger Sale by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenger sales were developed by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson in 2011, they looked through thousands of sales reps and found that there were five common profiles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hard Worker:&lt;/strong&gt; A self motivated striver who puts in the work and loves feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Relationship Builder:&lt;/strong&gt; Is great at building a rapport with clients and is generous with the amount of time they give each prospect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lone Wolf:&lt;/strong&gt; An independent type that follows their own instincts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem Solver:&lt;/strong&gt; A reliable and details oriented type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Challenger:&lt;/strong&gt; Focused on the end goal, loves to debate and doesn’t mind pushing the customer out of their comfort zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of these five profiles the challengers represented 40% of the top performing reps in Dixon and Adamson’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challengers win by understanding the way the prospect works and seeing the flaws and drawbacks and pointing out a better way, to get the prospect out of their comfort zone and see a new way of doing things. The challenger sales method is especially useful in complex sales situations where taking charge can be more beneficial in moving things along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Red-Book-Selling-Principles/dp/1885167601""&gt;5) The Little Red Book of Selling by Jeffrey Gitomer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the 12.5 principles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kick your own ass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare to win, or lose to someone who is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal branding IS sales: It’s not who you know, it’s who knows you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s all about value, it’s all about relationship, it’s not all about price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s NOT work, it’s NETwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can’t get in front of the real decision maker, you suck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage me and you can make me convince myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can make them laugh, you can make them buy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use CREATIVITY to differentiate and dominate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce their risk and you’ll convert selling to buying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you say it about yourself it’s bragging. When someone else says it about you its proof. 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antennas up! 12.5. Resign your position as general manager of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little book is a must read for entrepreneurs and business owners as it gives you a crash course into selling, from finding the decision maker to being able to pitch in a way that is both understandable and excites the guy who cuts the cheques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is relationship driven, referral orientated and finding out what the core buying motives of the customer are and then taking the right actions to get the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Predictable+Revenue+by+Aaron+Ross+and+Marylou+Tyler&amp;amp;qid=1605531650&amp;amp;sr=8-1""&gt;6) Predictable Revenue by Aaron Ross and Marylou Tyler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you generate leads through outbound sales then Predictable Revenue is a must read for you. It provides a how-to guide to create a repeatable and scalable lead generation process without cold calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of making cold calls to get in touch with prospects, they recommend sending cold emails to generate referrals to the decision-makers first, who then are likely to expect your call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage involves setting up the qualification call to figure out whether there’s a mutual fit between the prospect and sales rep, then from there you can focus on “selling the dream”. It’s a process that allows you to measure your effectiveness at every stage and then over time hone it to become a successful sales conversion machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Master-Art-Selling-Hopkins/dp/0586058966/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=How+to+master+the+art+of+selling+By%3A+Tom+Hopkins&amp;amp;qid=1605532257&amp;amp;sr=8-1""&gt;7) How to master the art of selling by Tom Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Hopkins earned himself over one million dollars in his first three years as a salesman, and he distills the lessons learned in this excellent guide to selling. He examines every stage of sales and selling, from sales calls to initial meetings, follow-ups and long-term strategies providing useful tools and tips to level up your sales skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also goes into “money study”, the learning to earn fivesome which when mastered allows you to acquire new knowledge quickly and thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repetition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinforcement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take impact for example the more you’re interested in a subject the more details you’ll remember about it and the better you’ll be able to talk about it. This applies in sales, if you can motivate yourself to master your pitch and speak with enthusiasm it’ll help you when dealing with prospects. If you can psych yourself up to learn you can do it more effectively and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sell-Human-Surprising-Persuading-Influencing/dp/1786891719/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=To+Sell+is+Human+By%3A+Daniel+H.+Pink&amp;amp;qid=1605535083&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1""&gt;8) To Sell is Human by Daniel H. Pink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is always selling, you’re trying to move someone to do something that you want them to do. You’re selling them on it, and there are no natural born sales people. It doesn’t matter if you’re an extravert you can still be a terrible salesperson because you talk too much and listen too little, and if you’re an introvert you’re too shy and timid to close; ambiverts make the best sales people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel offers great exercises to hone your skills and tips to make your offering more clear from offering less choices to empathising the potential of the product, not the achievements. He also covers how to approach clarifying the motives of others so you can then proceed to move them in the direction you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Pitch+Anything+By%3A+Oren+Klaff&amp;amp;qid=1605535587&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1""&gt;9) Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book Oren Klaff uses the latest developments in neuroeconomics to hack the brain and take advantage of how the brain reacts to make sure you stay in control of every stage of the pitch process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three processes to help you pitch and sell anything are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your pitch must speak to your audience’s neanderthal brain. Make yourself the prize. Use multiple so-called frames to trigger a gut decision in your favor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take number 3, there are multiple ways to create a gut decision such as a time frame i.e. we’re likely to sell out next month which creates a fomo (fear of missing out) reaction in the prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Sales-Machine-Turbocharge-Relentless/dp/1591842158/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Ultimate+Sales+Machine+By%3A+Chet+Holmes&amp;amp;qid=1605536132&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-2""&gt;10) Ultimate Sales Machine by Chet Holmes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chet Holmes was a selling master. He doubled sales for nine divisions of a Charlie Munger company, in the book he goes over the 12 key strategies you need to implement to succeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective time management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instituting higher standards and regular training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming a brilliant strategist by taking a strategic approach by educating your prospective customers so that you set the buying criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring superstars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting your best buyers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seven musts of marketing - You can&amp;#39;t rely on just using one marketing method to attract new customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winning the best buyers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sales skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow-up and client bonding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goals and measures - Standard material done well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a really thorough book that focussed on continued action and maintaining focus in order to succeed in sales.  &lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hi Everyone!

I hope you feel the same as I do when it comes to schedule a meeting with your prospect. If you do it right away it's OK else you may skip it and the whole presentation or sales call will take a different turn tomorrow.

While having a chat with prospects in LinkedIn we often agree to meet on a call to discuss further about the proposition in detail. So I ask them for their convenient date &amp; time and email address to schedule a meeting either on Google Meet or Zoom.

Although LinkedIn has its default ""create a meeting"" option in chat but for me it looks like adding one more another step to book a meeting and sharing it with the prospect. 

You create a meeting in LinkedIn via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Blue Jeans. It creates a meeting link with a message and adds it to text box in your chat. You hit enter and the prospect with whom you are having a chat will receive a link for the scheduled meeting.

No event entry to calendar that means no notification, no reminders. Consequently at the day of the call, both needs to check the meeting link (if both could recall it) in LinkedIn message and join the call. Higher chances of missing it, don't you think so.

So I built Pigeon - right mouse click to book a video meet.  
A Google chrome extension that allows users to book video meetings on Google Meet &amp; Zoom directly from LinkedIn chat.

1. Books video meeting in 15 seconds.
2. Notifies you &amp; your guests prior to the schedule.
3. Adds guests automatically from the chat room
4. Allows you to add guests manually
5. Dashboard view for your meetings &amp; Guests.
6. Export your guests to schedule follow-up sequences.

I would love to get your feedback and suggestions on it. If you book a meeting via Pigeon and help me with your feedback, I will be happy to enable your account to book unlimited meetings from Pigeon for a month. As of now free accounts can only schedule 10 meetings a month.

,Entrepreneur,"How can you design such an app that is standing out and making its mark? Are there any such ways that can elevate your app building game to a pro level app developer?

Let's find out!

Before jumping into the **mobile app design** process context, I would like to discuss some mobile application statistics.

* By 2024, the mobile count user might reach up to 7 billion roughly worldwide.

## Why Is it Important to Have Perfect App Design Process Steps?

The characteristics of mobile designs are changing the way we interact with any application around us.  It seems like they can guess our thoughts. This is only possible because app/ UX developers and [**web designing companies**](https://www.softwarefirms.co/directory/top-web-designing-companies) are working amazingly together to develop interactive Apps.

Let me relate this by giving an example -Think of a time you itself have read the guidelines or user manual for an application on your phone. I think it’s hard for you to recollect. Right?

It sounds irritating if someone tells us to follow user manuals’ long pages to find out how something works. No one likes to put their precious time reading such pages; instead, they want to use handy apps that are easy to understand and convenient to use.

If you are thinking about how to develop such a handy app? Let me give you the magical secret behind it.

While making an app, make sure your navigations, buttons, and icons are clear and precise.

Why?

Because these spots of an app make the base stronger, making it stronger with perfect app design process steps. These steps make your applications more accessible and convenient for use. So, as a mobile app developer, it’s our responsibility to make something user-friendly and engaging so that clients feel comfortable when they use it.

## What Are the App Design Process Steps You Should Follow?

As an app developer, there is something new consistently changing, whether talking with clients, making personas, portraying different forms of wireframes, or testing a model. These are classic pieces of the app design and development process.

As far as the UI/UX design process is considered, it significantly gets changed for different projects. Typically, it is partition into four key stages:

* Research
* Plan
* Implementation
* Testing

However, different developers have their own basic timetables and strategies for their own projects. It gets on changing as per new **mobile app trends** and depending upon what phase of the cycle you are in.

The app design process for any project has a beginning and end. It starts with an idea, research, planning, and ends up with implementation, testing, feedback, and maintenance.

But do you know what the one necessary topic is among those steps? No! It’s the **client**.

Yes, you heard it right. Yet designers’ responsibilities may differ day-to-day, but their main goal is to deliver a promising user experience application.

Now, it’s time to jump on the steps of the mobile app UI design process.

## Some Glimpse At the Critical Phases of An App Design Process

### 1. Research

The scope of having a better app starts with research. Why I am saying, this is because it can oversee the competitors, analyze a business, or speak to targeted clients. Having a conversation with expected clients at this stage can give you some benefits like:

* You can easily spot their trouble and issues.
* You can also get to know what type of features they are searching for in your project?

Having a research part in your project permits:

* To interpret what type of problem you should attempt to resolve with your project.
* Moreover, research permits you to understand the problem areas of the audience.
* It permits you to test your assumptions.
* Even, it becomes easy to discover similarities between your objectives and the audience you are targeting.

This type of analysis will help you in understanding the client’s necessities.

### 2. User Personas

Personas can assist developers with remarkable parts of the UI/UX plan. As far as the user persona is concerned, it gives an idea of who will use your product.

Remember, an organization earns maximum profits from their product if they know what they feel and want? Making a client persona dependent on research makes it simpler for the organization to include the clients in their plans.

The most important device in the UX design process is the client persona. This client persona is a steady suggestion to app designers that, at last, they are intended for genuine individuals.

Before you hurry out to do any plan or start prioritizing your app’s features, it’s important to understand the user persona.

Analyzing user persona helps you in understanding a few  things like:

* How would they like to use the web?
* How long do they go through connecting with your site right now?
* How long are they spending time on mobile phones?
* What features are attracting them to use web applications?
* What features of your apps are disappointing them?
* You will have answers to all these questions if you have a better analysis of the user persona.

So, get out and explore patterns in your industry and, more importantly, what’s trendy on the mobile web.

### 3. Design Phase

* **Wireframe**

Wireframes can be characterized as diagrams that show the plans’ format and capacities. Commonly, it starts with extremely fundamental, simple sketching of outlines and gradually gets advanced into the highest standard  Mockups.

You should start using testing and reviews actions at this phase because these Mockups will imitate the last plan.

Wireframing is likely the principle that goes to individuals’ minds when they consider UX plans, and it’s right to say wireframes are the most striking part in the planning of an app. They are screen captures of what the item will resemble. Utilizing all the examinations that we have done, start outlining into different forms of what the screen will resemble and what steps/moves a client will make to achieve any task.

Generally, the first sketch that we create is never great, so you can draw new ones and repeat the plans dependent on testing, input, and progressively including more subtleties of the wireframe. Before the end, we have exceptionally nitty gritty models that look precisely like the eventual outcome.

* **Prototyping**

A prototype is a downsized adaptation of the final outcome. It permits you to test your thoughts and plans before you get them created.

Thus, after finishing the wireframes and highly point-by-point Mockups that resemble a final outcome, a prototype is a must.  Prototyping is helpful when it comes time to test the plans.

### 4. Implementation Phase

The working of a UX designer with a development team is a vital factor in the whole cycle. This helps in making a decent app. The mobile app development team can transform your vision into the real world, which requires parallelism and cooperation.

I attempt to make the documentation cycle genuinely nitty-gritty and have the group included before on. When the engineers are included, they will analyze any perplexing plan segments from a specialized stance.

### 5. Testing Phase

Client testing is a fundamental part of the mobile app design process. Without testing an item, features, or plan, you won’t have a chance of knowing whether your project will address their issues or not.

Testing should be done at each stage of development, regardless of whether it is right now many portrayals on a table. The previous you begin testing the item, the additional time and cash you will spare.

By testing early, you can recognize the plans’ issues early, and also you can look after the new arrangements rapidly by drawing out the new forms of the plans that execute these fixes.

UX designers use convenience testing, an ordinarily utilized method that assesses how smooth and easy it is to understand a plan. In the wake of testing a few times, you will improve the project and adjust the models dependent on the outcomes.

Thus, you should test once more; this whole cycle of testing at different points of improvement is called iteration. Think of it as an experimentation cycle. When the item is in its last stages, there may be a need to roll out minor improvements as most serious issues have just been managed. This cycle permits you to spare time and costs related to rolling out a minute ago improvements.

The Power of Intention by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer


We are responsible for designing our lives. As Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, one of the most revered motivational speakers and self-help author once noted:
“The more you see yourself as what you'd like to become, and act as if what you want is already there, the more you'll activate those dormant forces that will collaborate to transform your dream into your reality.”

Your intention, what you choose to do or pursue, is the most powerful form of universal energy; it allows you to create the life you want to live and see. Wayne Dyers book, The Power of Intention: Learning to Co-Create Your World Your Way, is an actionable book on how to use intention to design the life you want.
If you’re interested in this book you can get 2 audiobooks for free with a trial of audible using the link in the description of this video. Subscribe and turn on the notification bell so you don’t miss any future summaries.
 
 
 
 
The premise of the book


The premise of the book is to use the power of intention to co-create or design our lives. Dyer discusses intention not as something you are or do, but as a form of universal energy that we are all part of and can tap into to create the lives we want to live.
To tap into the power of intention, Dyer outlines specific steps and strategies. This book summary discusses the most prominent lessons in Dyer’s book The Power of Intention.
 
 
 
 
Lesson 1: Success Follows Intention 
 
 
Success is not a happenstance; it follows intention, which is why no one has ever gone to bed poor and awoken to success patiently awaiting him/her by the door in the morning. Success is a result of intention, preparation, passion, consistent hard work, and determination. Success follows intention. 
To achieve success in your life, you need to “intend to achieve” and then create a plan that outlines the steps that allow you to tap into the power of intention–wanting to do, achieve, or be something—to create an extraordinary life.
To tap into the universal power of intention, a power that connects us all, start by making a conscious decision to be a certain way to or to achieve something, a certain aim. 
 “Our intention creates our reality.”

When your intention to achieve (or be) is strong, nothing will keep you from living an empowered, rich life. Taking action (responsibility for yourself) towards your intentions/purpose is the main principle taught in Dyer’s book The Power of Intention.
“You'll see it when you believe it.”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 2: When Fearful Or Uncertain, Consciously Tap Into Your Intention
 
 
Whenever you are fearful, low of energy, anxious or unsure, tap into your intention by visualizing a trolley hanging above your head and then yourself floating up to it and allowing it to carry you forth to your in-built intention. You can also reconnect to your intention by turning it into a mantra that you can repeat whenever you are feeling anxious.
According to Dyer, when you become a ‘connector,’ someone capable of consciously tapping into the universal power of intention, you stop hoping for success and instead become certain of what you need to do to achieve success.  
“Heaven on Earth is a choice you must make, not a place you must find.”
 
 
 
 
Lesson 3: Act As If 
 
 
“Act as if everything you desire is already here… treat yourself as if you already are what you’d like to become.”

“Acting as if” is one of the most profound lessons you will learn from The Power of Intention. Dyer uses very captivating language to describe the power of believing in yourself and acting as if you are what you want to become or have what you want to achieve.
“With everything that has happened to you, you can either feel sorry for yourself or treat what has happened as a gift. Everything is either an opportunity to grow or an obstacle to keep you from growing. You get to choose.”

The concept shared here is similar to the modern day concept of “faking it till you make it.” To start acting as if, your intention needs to be clear, which is why the first step is to clarify your aim or intention. Whom do you want to become? What do you want to achieve? The easier it is to visualize–with clear detail—what you want, the easier it shall be to feel confident enough about achieving it. Feeling confident and deserving will help you act as if what you want is already part of your life. 
 
 
 
 
Lesson 4: The Seven Faces Of Intention
 
 
“Seven Faces of Intention: Creativity, Kindness, Love, Beauty, Expansion, Unlimited Abundance, and Receptivity.”

Intention has seven faces, each of which Dyer goes out of his way to explain, expound on, and turn into actionable information for all readers.


Conclusion 
To tap into the power of intuition, be creative, kind, loving, appreciative of the beauty in everything, expansive, abundant, and receptive to the universe. 
 “If you knew who walked beside you at all times, on the path that you have chosen, you could never experience fear or doubt again.”

Problem: Many entrepreneurs are looking for a business problem, potentially in an industry they are not hugely familiar with, and thus generally have many calls with potential customers to understand the market prior to even honing in on the specific problem they want to  validate and then solve. This is a process which each entrepreneur repeats from square zero because the community doesn’t have an incentive to share.

Solution: The Business Problem podcast.  Every month I will choose an industry and interview the people who work there. I will collate the information and give an overview of where money and time is spent and describe recurrent specific business problems. Each industry will have two episodes: one for the customer side, and the second for the solution space, aka competition-analysis. For this second episode I will interview startups as well as larger established service providers and present their methods for solving the problems mentioned in the customer episode.

An app that people get to have someone chase them while they're running to give that little boost and excitement of actually running from something. 

Basically how it works (daydreamed idea so bare with me) is you download the app, draw out your route on the map and go about your run. At some point during the run you'll hear someone shout ""chaser."" And its game on, full sprint. It would last for a selected amount of time or you could opt to evade to end of route. Here's the catch, if you're *caught* you forfeit like 3 to 5 bucks through the app which is incentive to be faster and well...suck less. Safe words would be implemented to abort the chase if you have an injury or feel unsafe.

,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone! I post regularly about business ideas and opportunities. If you want to see more well-researched ideas, you can do so [here](http://brainstorms.io/).

Today, I’ve got 3 solid, albeit not well-researched, ideas that I think you could turn into pretty sweet businesses or side projects. Here’s what I’ve been thinking about -

1. **Donut App for FB, Telegram, or Whatsapp Groups** \- As we continue to shift to a more virtual world, the need for online communities is increasing. One of the most challenging parts of building a community is having active and engaged members - this is especially difficult if the community is online.One Slack app, [Donut](https://www.donut.com/), helps facilitate connections between members in a light-weight, automated way. With thousands of communities being built on platforms beyond Slack - e.g. Telegram, Whatsapp, FB, Memberful, etc... Anecdotally, I've found it super helpful in connecting with people on Slack. I think there is an opportunity to build a similar app for other platforms.
2. **Software Trial Management** \- As someone who signs up for TONs of software trials, there’s nothing worse than forgetting to cancel it before I get charged - which happens pretty often. A study showed 48% of people forget to cancel their trials before auto-renewal kicks in. While there are a few apps that help manage your software subscriptions, most don’t track your free trials. A simple chrome extension could solve this problem for me. Ideally, it could cancel my trial automatically, but I’d also be fine if it sent me a reminder to cancel.
3. **ISAs for Trade Occupations** \- Income Share Agreements (ISAs) have been picking up steam lately. With an ISA, an education program waives upfront costs in exchange for a percentage of the graduate’s income for a specified number of years. This works well because as a student you only have to pay for the program if you’re able to find a job post-graduation. Lambda School has raised over $100M using this model but operates exclusively to train programmers. Taking that same idea and applying to it welders, carpenters, plumbers, and other trade occupations could be a big win. The demand for these jobs has been steadily increasing and they can easily pay $50k+/year.

Thanks for reading! I may write longer versions of these at some point - especially if people are digging one idea in particular.

,Entrepreneur,"Hi all, I hope this may be a good place to ask this question. If not, my sincere apologies and kindly point me somewhere more appropriate...

I have set up a private membership site for community support and learning in the relationships/personal growth area. 

My challenge is that I want it to be an all-female community, so I am looking for effective ways to verify that people are who they say they are.

Because it is a site where women are sharing intimate conversations about sex, I sometimes find men curious and trying to apply to the site, saying they are women. 

But because of the nature of the conversations, the women there are also keen to protect their identity e.g. most of them would be too shy to go on video chat, for example.

I am not taking payments for anything at the moment although I plan to in future. 

I was thinking that if I set up a payment portal, people could provide their credit card details into a secure system, maybe paying a small fee for lifetime membership, and also serve as a type of identity/gender verification.

BUT I need to know... if you accept online payments e.g. via Stripe, do you see the actual name on the person's credit card, or just the card number?

Do you think this could work as a means to verify whether someone is female or not?

If not, can you think of a better way?

I have just come across this online - [https://www.trulioo.com/product/identity-verification#pricing](https://www.trulioo.com/product/identity-verification#pricing) which looks interesting - it seems like the free service will allow you to take someone's name and DOB and check them against Government records. But that seems very easy for someone to fake (give their friend's details). I suppose asking for the National ID Number as well would make it harder to fake, but that is a lot of information to ask people to give away, don't you think? It seems to me it would feel more comfortable to simply make a payment into a recognised card processing service....

Thank you for any help or ideas you may have from your time and experience.

If not, my sincere apologies and kindly point me somewhere more appropriate...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set up a private membership site for community support and learning in the relationships/personal growth area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My challenge is that I want it to be an all-female community, so I am looking for effective ways to verify that people are who they say they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is a site where women are sharing intimate conversations about sex, I sometimes find men curious and trying to apply to the site, saying they are women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because of the nature of the conversations, the women there are also keen to protect their identity e.g. most of them would be too shy to go on video chat, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not taking payments for anything at the moment although I plan to in future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking that if I set up a payment portal, people could provide their credit card details into a secure system, maybe paying a small fee for lifetime membership, and also serve as a type of identity/gender verification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT I need to know... if you accept online payments e.g. via Stripe, do you see the actual name on the person&amp;#39;s credit card, or just the card number?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think this could work as a means to verify whether someone is female or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, can you think of a better way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just come across this online - &lt;a href=""https://www.trulioo.com/product/identity-verification#pricing""&gt;https://www.trulioo.com/product/identity-verification#pricing&lt;/a&gt; which looks interesting - it seems like the free service will allow you to take someone&amp;#39;s name and DOB and check them against Government records. But that seems very easy for someone to fake (give their friend&amp;#39;s details). I suppose asking for the National ID Number as well would make it harder to fake, but that is a lot of information to ask people to give away, don&amp;#39;t you think? It seems to me it would feel more comfortable to simply make a payment into a recognised card processing service....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any help or ideas you may have from your time and experience. &lt;/p&gt;

// I imagine that after reading this some people might have questions regarding why we're doing this, why to do it here, and others. I'll try to answer the most important ones below.

Q: Why the f are you guys doing this on reddit and HN? Why not tap into your network of engineers? *Internet disrupted reach. The reach we'll have here is far greater than our networks. Based on the 400 to 1 rule there is a lot of talent here, we may get lucky and find one. If you're not familiar with the 400 to 1 rule: research shows that if we compare the number one student from the best college (let's say MIT/Stanford?) with people spread all around the world we would find 400 people that are better than him, they are unknowns just because they don't have the same credentials.*

Q: Why a side project? Why don't you just vet the guy and put a 1-year cliff in place? *I don't know if you have ever been part of a high growth startup before, but I've seen this happen first hand: if a cofounder leaves on a cliff everybody else that owns equity gets scared (early employees owns % of our 10% talent pool), can demotivate, we can lose trust, things may break, we can't afford the risk. Bottom line: We can assess technical skills with an interview but it is very hard to assess someone's work ethic, desire to win, commitment, learning curve speed and so on without actually working with that person.*

Q: To assess this better it would be important to know the last round's valuation. Can you share that? *Yes, $5.5m. Investors own 10% and our talent pool is also set to 10%.*

Q: There's no information about the entire tech stack you guys are using. Can you share that? *No, we did that on purpose. We want to avoid people telling us that they are a good fit because they have experience in each part of our tech stack — that's highly unlikely. So we will talk about our tech stack after we ask you about yours. Besides, you will not be excluded if you don't know it, I bet you can learn it.*",t2_6loi915t,False,,0,False,We raised $550k and we want to add a 3rd technical co-founder,[],r/Entrepreneur,False,6,,0,,False,t3_jvxlf4,False,dark,0.62,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605664214.0,text,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the startup:&lt;/strong&gt; incorporated 4 months ago, raised $550k pre-seed, b2b, currently in stealth mode, working with 3 fortune 1000 early customers.

I'm in the process of paying a web developer to help me with a business idea that I've been contemplating for a few years. Over time, the original idea has changed, developed, and grown. I need help strategizing, seeing the bigger picture and potential pitfalls, and conceptualizing the fundamentals.

As I'm writing everything down below (I've written and jotted this down 100x and it's never the same) I'm realizing how jumbled and untargeted my thoughts are. I'm wasting money on the web developer because nothing that is detailed below is 100% concrete. It's just TOO MANY ideas and not enough focus to be a successful business.

I'd like advice on which apects of the business sound most appealing and which ideas I should focus the most attention on. Definitiely interested in hearing where to trim it down.

**The Backstory:**

I was into e-commerce really big. Just like everybody else on earth, I was making a load of money selling on platforms like Amazon and eBay. I was able to sustain a living and the idea of e-com was appealing to me and I saw a future in it. The driving force behind my success was that I had (essentially) $0.00 in overhead. I would go out to affluent communities on ""bulk trash day"" and collect furniture, electronics, and anything else saleable. These items would be posted and sold, and I made 100% of the profits (minus shipping fees, eBay fees, PayPal fees, gas from driving to the affluent communities etc, cost of storage.)

Last may I was banned from Amazon and eBay. I broke the rules as laid forth in their TOA and lost my selling privileges. For a long time I wanted to get back on those platforms by being sneaky, but after numerous failed attempts, I see that brute force entry into a club that doesn't want you in attendance is not a good strategy. If I want to continue my e-com endeavors, I must adapt. 

**The Ideas:** All of the ideas below are intended to be built into the website somehow.

**A. BUYBACK STORE**

I really like the idea of these buyback websites. They are self-sustaining and offer cash upfront for (insert niche market here.) They are focused and targeted and have high conversion rates. If you sell printers on the back end, you buy used printers from your patrons on the front end of your website, for a reasonable (but discounted) offer. You see this business model with textbooks, ink toner, and high end electronics etc.

My site would offer to buy used merchandise from our patrons and shop around for the best deal from the stores that already exist and do this. You'd be able to sell various items back to my company. My company would be middle manning between 5-6 already established vendors while taking the cream off the top of the cake. 

How it works

1. Log In to Your Profile
2. Upload a picture of your item and a brief description of what it is through a template our site offers
3. I see that it's an old toner that is no longer being used the ABC company. I look up the value for this toner on a competators website
4. Competators website offers me cash for the toner.
5. I offer 10% markdown on competator's offer to me and pass along to customer
6. Customer ships me the toner/gets paid
7. I ship toner to competator/get paid

*""Hey you! Ready to recycle your stuff for cash?*

*We will make you an offer for your gently used furniture, ink, toner, electronics, (etc etc) and pay you cash flat out!""*

**B. E-Commerce Dropship Merchant**

Everybody wants to dropship for other people....but I want to have people dropship my stuff

Offering a percentage of ""trash merchandise"" in a storefront for other re-sellers to sell for us. Because there is no overhead on the high end items that we find in the trash (we literally found a rolex one time and sold it for 5k), and we no longer are in front of a large audience, we would like to offer our items, pictures, and product description to other resellers. They then can use our images and sell our merchandise for us. If they make the sale, we dropship to their customer for them. We would essentially be a dropship vendor in an enviorment where everybody wants to be a dropshipping merchant. 

The categories would be laid out by platform or product catergory. IE Amazon (New Goods) Amazon (Used Goods) Poshmark (Clothes). Or ""Electronics"" ""Clothing"" ""Car Parts"" etc.

Our sellers would have a member profile that they can log into. They can then view the products that are available for sale from our ""product store"" and view a list of items that they have ""claimed"" and want to see on our behalf. 

How it works:

1. Resellers Log Into Their Profile
2. Source Items that Look Appealing and fit the general theme of their personal ecom store
3. Somehow the reseller claims the product so that it becomes unavailable for others to sell(most products are 1 offs)
4. Customer sells product in their store
5. Customer sends me the money
6. Either I ship direct to reseller or I ship to end user (havent figured it out yet.

*""MYCOMPANY is a privately owned reCommerce site that gives established e-commerce vendors the opportunity to list and sell merchandise without having to go through the hassle of storing, taking photos, or writing descriptions for the goods that we provide. NO CASH DOWN. We want to make the selling process easy for you. After a brief screening process, you’ll have access to hundreds of products, their descriptions, and their photos. All you have to do is post them in your store, and when the merchandise sells, we will ship it for you! MYCOMPANY makes it easy for you to source, sell, and profit.""*

**C.  Online Store**

Basically you can just flat out buy our merchandise if you want it. The store would probably be laid out in conjuntion with the ""Dropship reseller catalogue"" (*section B*) but instead of a ""sell this item"" button that our regular customers would see, there would be a button that says, ""buy this item"". This doesnt require much explaniation. It's just a regular online store that has a little of everything (terrible business model) and has no focus. It's essentially an online pawn shop full of odds and ends.

*“There's no mystery when you buy from MYCOMPANY. We pay close attention to the condition of every item that we list for sale. We guarantee that.""*

**D. Partner / Donate**

I deal with a lot of people who are into scrapping, demolition, house cleanouts, real estate, and several other businesses. A lot of times people offer me free stuff or just give me things to sell for them. I'd like to feature a ""Partner With Us"" section for businesses that would like to work out deals with my company on a regular bulk basis. We also would make a pledge to donate to charity, plant trees, or some other green/philanthropic initiative. Each donation would result in 1 tree planted or 10$ towards the gofund me of your choice. ETC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It's really not that complicated but without a real focus, it'll be hard to market and hard to convert clicks. What do you guys think.

If I'm going problem vs. solution....I've reversed engineered the question that all entreprenuers ask. ""what problem do I solve for my customer"" has turned into ""ive got a problem selling my merchandise online...how do I solve it."" The snowball just ended up turning from there.

As I was making all this money it dawned on me that my true passion was slipping away. Sure making all this money was great, but it felt like stress, and I felt like I wasn’t serving my true purpose. 

When you make all that money you begin to feel guilty because you’re watching people around you struggle. My true passion is helping people through content and through music. Nothing feels more fulfilling than getting multiple messages a day from people letting you know how you’re changing their lives. 

How do you guys deal with choosing whether you want to do something you hate and make 300k per year vs something you love and make 100k per year. 

Should we spend our lives being happy or chase money and feel depressed and unfulfilled? Let’s not forget there’s also the possibility to make more money by doing what you love as opposed to just doing what works. 

These days people watch gurus on YouTube speaking about how they made millions and they immediately try it themselves without realize that it might not be your calling. I’m realizing too many people lack self-awareness and too many become depressed as a result. 

What would the world be without people who love their craft? What would the world be without talented people?

,Entrepreneur,"My partner and I were always into kink, but it wasn't until we specialized that we started seeing some success. (Over $300,000 in sales our first year!) Although now I'm worried we've saturated the market too quickly... Our kink- *Moose bursting through screen door play ;)*

The Market: The online kink play market is near completely saturated. Being a relatively private consumer experience, kink play and sex toys transitioned early and effortlessly to online retail.  By finding a small, growing and currently underserved niche, we were able to rise to the top our our market segment very quickly. In fact, we are still the ONLY *moose bursting through screen door play* dedicated retailer.

The Opportunity: Our current customers are very reliable, with each ordering over $1K in equipment an accessories per year. Reaching this customer base allowed us to grow to just over $300K in sales in our first fiscal year, and we're on track for roughly the same numbers this year.. Although now it feels like we've reached a plateau.

The Dilemma: How we expand our market- Maybe we went a little too niche?? It feels like most of our customers at at there spending limit, each already busting nearly two screen doors per year, and we'll need to draw more consumers into the market segment in order to grow our sales revenue.

Yet, as with any kink play, it takes a very specialized interest, and it's a different for everyone. Just because you're into one kink, doesn't mean you're into others. It's not like some broad marketing strategy is going to help us! (not to mention we can't advertise everywhere).

We've discussed holding conferences, or meet-ups, as the community is already very connected, and most come from the same geographical community in Canada. This would help us gain more exposure and hopefully attract more players who have been curious but haven't taken the first leap (or screen bust!). The primary concern with conferences is primarily the fear of being connected with the Furry community, who seem to have gathered a lot of negative attention in recent years, and through our market research (most of us are pen pals) it's important to the community to maintain themselves as a 'Wholesome kink"".

So where do we go from here? How do we expand our market without alienating our current customer base? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I'd post our website if you wanted to check it out but I think that's against the rules?

,Entrepreneur,"I recently read Malcolm Gladwell's bestseller 'Blink', and I got curious as to how our own brains trick us into making choices that are neither sound nor what we truly want to choose.

Everything we do every day is either directly or indirectly packed in a simple, yet complicated task: making decisions.  More often than not, however, we rely on the trust we place in other people to help us with tasks we might not be well versed in or have no time to do ourselves. “Trust your guts,” they say, and there goes trouble. 

Several kinds of research proved that what we think is the right choice is often our brain manipulating us into believing so. We make preferences of people over others **not** based on facts but on years of stereotypes deeply embedded in our minds.

On a conscious level, for instance, we don’t think we treat tall people differently from how we treat shorter people. Plenty shreds of evidence, however, proved otherwise. Height — particularly in men — does trigger a certain set of very positive unconscious associations.

Another example is how people tend to agree more with someone who talks more frequently or has the most impressive title in a meeting, even at the expense of someone with the most constructive and innovative ideas.

We’ve been falling for false expertise in our life, and at our workplace in particular, for a really long time, and it all began with heeding to mindlessly trust our guts, or as said by the books. The consequences of the decisions we all make are our responsibility, despite our inability to directly control our unconscious minds.

Don’t fake results, mend the process.

I used to jump right into coding - and totally skip the discovery phase - the one where you listen to your users and communities. I recently started looking at how the communities I am interested in behaved on Facebook, which gave me **interesting insights**.

I want to keep practicing, so I offer **analysis** for content (max 100 posts) on any **public Facebook group** or **public Facebook page** \- (so that you can spend more time coding 😅) for a [coffee ☕️](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/buymeacoffee.com/bencotte).

➡️ If you are interested - just **comment below**

**Details**

* Offer available until the end of this WEEK for the 5 first requests
* ~~5~~ 4 available (EDIT on Nov 16th)

**What you can expect**

* Human classification of posts by topics and subtopics (I'll do my best - I promise 🙏)
* Pivot table showing the total of posts per topic/subtopic, an average of comments, likes, and shares
* Raw data as a Google Sheet

**Why am I doing this?**

I am currently doing it for the niche I am interested in, and I would like to stretch this muscle a bit.

&lt;p&gt;I used to jump right into coding - and totally skip the discovery phase - the one where you listen to your users and communities. I recently started looking at how the communities I am interested in behaved on Facebook, which gave me &lt;strong&gt;interesting insights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep practicing, so I offer &lt;strong&gt;analysis&lt;/strong&gt; for content (max 100 posts) on any &lt;strong&gt;public Facebook group&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;public Facebook page&lt;/strong&gt; - (so that you can spend more time coding 😅) for a &lt;a href=""https://www.indiehackers.com/post/buymeacoffee.com/bencotte""&gt;coffee ☕️&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;➡️ If you are interested - just &lt;strong&gt;comment below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Human classification of posts by topics and subtopics (I&amp;#39;ll do my best - I promise 🙏)&lt;/li&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

I've seen so many advertisers think that they need to perfect their targeting, ad sets, etc to improve their results.

Which to an extent is true, but it can only take you so far.

There's one variable that truly impacts your ad performance, i.e. your messaging/creatives and copy.

I run a marketing agency in India, and I've started working with international clients as well.

Many of these clients have seen a drop off with their results over the years, when they come to me, they say that their ads are not working, and they think it's Facebook's fault, or they need better targeting options.

But the truth is most of the times their businesses need only little improvement with their ad strategy and targeting.

The main improvement comes from working on their messaging and creatives. As soon as we changed their creatives, they've seen amazing growth with their ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), sometimes even more that 150%.

(We also helped improve their targeting, which can be a contributor to this growth as well)

But the question is, why are the results dropping off?

- It's no secret that Facebook/Instagram Ads is getting saturated day-by-day, and the more advertisers there are, the more expensive CPC you'll get.
- People are also getting numbed to the same old/average ads, so having good creatives and messaging helps you stop their scroll.

So as you move forward, I implore you to focus more on creatives as well.

Some tips to improve your creatives:-
- Make it more simple: People have less time to watch what you're selling, so keep it quick and respect their time 
- Focus on your copy:- The image will stop the person, but the copy is what truly will sell your ad, and make them click on your link.
- Keep it fresh:- When you see your results drop off, change your creatives and messaging again-n-again.

If you guys are getting good results, chances are that you have good creatives and copy, kudos to you, keep improving :)",t2_1uf9artg,False,,0,False,Ads are much more than Targeting Options.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'How to Grow'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_jvrm04,False,dark,0.43,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},How to Grow,False,0,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605642215.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

Upvoty are currently bringing in $6.6k ([Verified](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/upvoty/revenue)) Monthly Recurring Revenue as of today. 

They provide 3 services: Feedback boards, product roadmaps &amp; change-logs. 

&gt;For obvious reasons, we will not deal with “how to build the product” because that’s a founder’s call to take. But we will look at how to get started from a marketing &amp; growth POV.

## Domain Names

Finding a domain name can be daunting, especially if you are thinking of .com. 

So, here is a list of available .com domains you can use for this product. 

All of them are priced at $13 or lower.

#### [Download List of Domains](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=157tcrk4jp3sVpvnNPbVZ9cC084KsZ4zZ)

## SEO Keywords &amp; PPC

The SEO keywords shared in the report are based on current competition. The websites that I considered for this list were Upvoty &amp; Canny.io

There are 2 lists of Keywords here:

1. Intent based keywords
2. Context based keywords (LSI)

Intent based keywords are phrases that you’ll want to rank for on Google search. Keywords like “product roadmap tool“, “user feedback tools” etc will fall under this category. 

To get the most out of Intent based keywords use them in important places like Titles, H1s and subheadings. 

In short, build your web pages around these keywords. 

Also, if you want to be more aggressive in acquiring customers, you can use “Intent keywords” in your PPC campaigns for search and GDN (Google Display Network) ads.

#### [Download the list of intent-based keywords](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1pSIXt3xA0ehTYdZTDSO3VlguBemRaeua)

Context based keywords (LSI) on the other hand are used to indicate to search engines that a particular webpage is about a certain topic. For example a page about feedback tools will likely have LSI keywords like users, survey, features, roadmaps, products etc. 

To get the most out of LSI keywords use them in the body text. Keep the density of these keywords to about 1-2% of the total keywords on the page.

In short, add these to your paragraphs and other less important locations.

#### [Download the list of context based keywords](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1Wm1Yl5qiQS47bG-f4RJWSHvEMkQtqaDr)

## Blog Content Ideas

With respect to the blog content this is not an exhaustive list by any means. There are a lot of content opportunities that you can exploit.

I would focus on tent pole content instead of short 300 word posts initially to build healthy backlinks to the site.

Also, when you are thinking of content creation think of how you can get people into the top of your funnel first and then get them to convert instead of making a sales pitch from the start. *(AARRR Framework -* [*resource*](https://medium.com/@ms.mbalke/aarrr-framework-metrics-that-let-your-startup-sound-like-a-pirate-ship-e91d4082994b)*)*

If you manage to stay on top of your prospective customer’s mind, they will likely remember you when they are making a buying decision. So make sure that you get in front of them often even if the topics are not necessarily directly related to your core product. 

Topics like product strategy guide, product roadmap guide etc will get more people to notice your brand. 

Lastly, there is only so much you can write about “user feedback tools” so it is a good idea to expand your content marketing scope to include supplementary content that does not directly involve your product.

#### [Download list of tentpole content](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1ddeQGmTrkmWJUJqG3IaqDhX-XFbu1VgP)

## Quora Marketing (Short Q&amp;As)

Apart from doing tent pole content, it is also important to establish authority on short form content. 

This can be as simple as answering questions on Quora.com.

I’ve added this section for primarily 2 reasons. 

1. There is significant Q&amp;A interest from prospects. 
2. A lot of long tail keyword opportunities. 

Here are some nuances to keep in mind.

Start by answering 5-6 questions everyday and slowly increase the amount of answers. 

Do not add links on your first few answers. Quora might end up shadow banning or even worse completely banning you. You can start adding the links gradually once you have been on the site for 2 weeks or more.

Add your job title preferably as “Co-founder” or “Entrepreneur” and add your domain name as your employer. Example, Steven Smith, Co-Founder at feedbackbro.com

Ignore “answer requests”; they usually have low ROI.

Give legitimate answers and avoid copy-pasting templated answers initially so that the system doesn’t flag you. 

I’ve compiled a list of questions and their Quora links. Just click on them and start answering. 

#### [Download list of Quora questions and their links](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-4qyI4cAGh1YqAv-in_cX1-WP3OLJOH9/view?usp=sharing)

## Influencers, Communities &amp; Affiliates

Products like this grow faster with recommendations and good word of mouth. But again, it is important to choose your audience/referral partner carefully. 

&gt;Use blogs and newsletters to advertise or sign up as an affiliate brand. 

#### [Download list of blogs and newsletters](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1BBxXAf0CZC4p4Y_BO8wCLSCdT6NPmu1b)

&gt;Use influencers as product evangelists, affiliates and advertisers

#### [Download list of influencers](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1DSkgiZZEA_u8jABIxTdaLQUcxh_Yptcz)

&gt;Use podcasts as publishers and affiliates (Sponsored content, ads etc)

#### [Download list of podcasts](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1TSAIY2zX9zsvVyHKJ8-rQIFu_ZbSP44g)

&gt;Use groups for user feedback, soft promotion and support.

&lt;p&gt;In short, build your web pages around these keywords. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you want to be more aggressive in acquiring customers, you can use “Intent keywords” in your PPC campaigns for search and GDN (Google Display Network) ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context based keywords (LSI) on the other hand are used to indicate to search engines that a particular webpage is about a certain topic. For example a page about feedback tools will likely have LSI keywords like users, survey, features, roadmaps, products etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of LSI keywords use them in the body text. Keep the density of these keywords to about 1-2% of the total keywords on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, add these to your paragraphs and other less important locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;amp;id=1Wm1Yl5qiQS47bG-f4RJWSHvEMkQtqaDr""&gt;Download the list of context based keywords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blog Content Ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the blog content this is not an exhaustive list by any means. There are a lot of content opportunities that you can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would focus on tent pole content instead of short 300 word posts initially to build healthy backlinks to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, when you are thinking of content creation think of how you can get people into the top of your funnel first and then get them to convert instead of making a sales pitch from the start. &lt;em&gt;(AARRR Framework -&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=""https://medium.com/@ms.mbalke/aarrr-framework-metrics-that-let-your-startup-sound-like-a-pirate-ship-e91d4082994b""&gt;&lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you manage to stay on top of your prospective customer’s mind, they will likely remember you when they are making a buying decision. So make sure that you get in front of them often even if the topics are not necessarily directly related to your core product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics like product strategy guide, product roadmap guide etc will get more people to notice your brand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is only so much you can write about “user feedback tools” so it is a good idea to expand your content marketing scope to include supplementary content that does not directly involve your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;amp;id=1ddeQGmTrkmWJUJqG3IaqDhX-XFbu1VgP""&gt;Download list of tentpole content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quora Marketing (Short Q&amp;amp;As)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from doing tent pole content, it is also important to establish authority on short form content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be as simple as answering questions on Quora.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve added this section for primarily 2 reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is significant Q&amp;amp;A interest from prospects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of long tail keyword opportunities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some nuances to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by answering 5-6 questions everyday and slowly increase the amount of answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not add links on your first few answers. Quora might end up shadow banning or even worse completely banning you. You can start adding the links gradually once you have been on the site for 2 weeks or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your job title preferably as “Co-founder” or “Entrepreneur” and add your domain name as your employer. Example, Steven Smith, Co-Founder at feedbackbro.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore “answer requests”; they usually have low ROI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give legitimate answers and avoid copy-pasting templated answers initially so that the system doesn’t flag you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve compiled a list of questions and their Quora links. Just click on them and start answering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Influencers, Communities &amp;amp; Affiliates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Products like this grow faster with recommendations and good word of mouth. But again, it is important to choose your audience/referral partner carefully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use blogs and newsletters to advertise or sign up as an affiliate brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use influencers as product evangelists, affiliates and advertisers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use groups for user feedback, soft promotion and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea is to interview as many people as possible who have managed to start a business and make a living from it, about their work habits. For example how many hours they work per day, what tools they use, etc... From the answers, I will make a dataviz to try to highlight some patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the gist:

# Building a community

Focus on your Superfans (1000 core fans). Consolidate your community and ban the trolls. He spends time on Twitter talking with his fans and he eliminates trolls on the spot. Focus on being positive. He also talked about having millions of followers but no fans - it's a vanity metric and nothing more.

# You cannot sell a shit sandwich twice

Whatever you build, IT HAS TO WORK. It doesn't have to be sexy (unless that's your product). It just has to work so people find value in it. Build for value, maximize for distribution.

# Building is never easy

Whenever you hear that ""this is very easy to build because XYZ"", is bullshit. Building a product that provides value is very hard. Don't kid yourself. This is not an easy way to make money. 

# Becoming successful in one thing opens the doors into being successful in **everything** 

It is all about work ethic. Work on being able to work more. Working ""efficiently"" comes later.

# You don't guide life. You **ride** life

You can plan as much as you want but you need to ride with the flow. Or flow with the ride. As an Entrepreneur you have to understand that you CANNOT control a single thing. You can prepare but you cannot control.

,Entrepreneur,"I've seen quite a few Reddit'ers talking about being scammed, left empty handed and not paid on-time. I want to share my learnings on how you can eradicate that problem.

I've been burnt numerous times during my early days of freelancing. Either my client's were reluctant to pay me until they were paid by their customers or I got tired of their constant changes and refunded the entire project amount to get them off my back.

Since then I've been able to scale my operation  (which sadly I took a step away as of this month - [shared the story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jsihp9/after_generating_2900945_i_called_it_quits_to/)). During this time I haven't had an unpaid invoice and most clients have been me promptly.

In retrospective, I think I stand true to this statement. **It's not the client, it's us**. During the early days, I was in-experienced and couldn't foresee what might happen. I also didn't know how to communicate my expectations clearly. As time went on and I understood what was happening, I realised there were controls I could put into place that would help me mitigate these situations from happening.

**Here are some tips to help you get paid on-time every-time:**

1. Focus on working with registered businesses if you can. The law generally will cover you in these situations. Sending a cease and desist letter is practically free and it scares the sh\*t out of them. Did this with one of my larger clients back in 2018. Suggested by my solicitor and it worked like a charm. If you work with solo-founders, without a business - you legally can't do much to them to get you to pay you back. They're not a registered entity.
2. Always take a deposit payment. It's 2020, I'd be surprised that anyone even works without taking a deposit now.
3. Have a clear proposal which marks out all the payment milestones. When you go through the proposal stage, focus on this. Plant the seed about how the payment structure works and that no work starts until a payment milestone is cleared. This will vary depending on the scale of your clients. Larger enterprises work strictly on a NET15/30 payment cycle.
4. Get your legals right. Don't forget to have a late payment clause. It works like a charm. However to be honest, I've never slapped on this fee with any client even if they're late. It's just a scare tactic.
5. Break up your project into smaller chunks and take a milestone payment at the completion of each stage.  

   1. Deposit (Pays for first chunk of work) &gt; Complete first chunk of work &gt; Take milestone payment (Technically this is a payment that covers the second chunk of work)
   2. If you follow this process, you will always be covering your ass!

Last but not least. Be confident. Know when to be friendly and when to be firm. Remember you are a service provider, domain expert and industry know-how. Stay in control of the engagement at all times.

Hopefully this helps you in working with payments moving forward.

I want to share my learnings on how you can eradicate that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been burnt numerous times during my early days of freelancing. Either my client&amp;#39;s were reluctant to pay me until they were paid by their customers or I got tired of their constant changes and refunded the entire project amount to get them off my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve been able to scale my operation  (which sadly I took a step away as of this month - &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jsihp9/after_generating_2900945_i_called_it_quits_to/""&gt;shared the story here&lt;/a&gt;). During this time I haven&amp;#39;t had an unpaid invoice and most clients have been me promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospective, I think I stand true to this statement. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the client, it&amp;#39;s us&lt;/strong&gt;. During the early days, I was in-experienced and couldn&amp;#39;t foresee what might happen. I also didn&amp;#39;t know how to communicate my expectations clearly. As time went on and I understood what was happening, I realised there were controls I could put into place that would help me mitigate these situations from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some tips to help you get paid on-time every-time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,Entrepreneur,"Ever heard of shadow powers?

They're people closest to the most powerful people in the world - Presidents, Billionaires, and Celebrities. Shadow powers spend years with these high performing individuals, learn tons of stuff, and yet are rarely known outside their own circles.

Ben Casnocha was Reid Hoffman's shadow, for close to 2 years. And you better believe he was powerful. I spent last night reading [this](https://casnocha.com/reid-hoffman-lessons) amazing article Ben wrote, sharing all he learned from Reid.  I've just recently started taking notes on what I read and thought I'd share my notes on the article. Here we go ...

**1)** **Tradeoffs**

Every Decision has Tradeoffs. When you choose 1 thing. You choose not to do some other thing.

Think about the number of choices Reid has. When he chooses to do attend 1 conference, he ignores hundreds of others. We don't face so many complex choices but it's interesting to remind ourselves time and again - when we choose Netflix, we choose not to work on something, or when you chose to read this post, you also chose not to spend the next 15 minutes browsing Instagram.

**2) False Choices**

Should entrepreneurs set plans or be ready to adapt? False Choices. The answer is - Both.  

Should you have a small number of intimate friends or a large number of looser ties. Again, false choices. You need both.

**3)  People are complicated. Root for their better angels.**

Reid Hoffman is widely known as the ultimate connector. He understands the full spectrum of strengths and weaknesses of a person. Flaws that cause us to disengage are navigable to Reid. 

**4)  The best way to get powerful people's attention - offer to help them**

""I reviewed thousands of requests for Reid's time/attention/money. It was stunning how few offered to help him."" 

Most people think there's no way to help Bill Gates or Reid Hoffman.  But what Bill or Reid craves is information. A unique perspective. An insight into something happening in your corner of the universe. They can't buy that off the shelf.

Help first. It's key to building relationships - even with the most powerful people.

**5) Keep it simple and move fast  When faced with a set of options**

Reid Hoffman will frequently make a provisional decision instinctually based on current information.   Then he will note what additional information he would need to disprove his decision.  

The key for startups is moving fast. On the other hand, big companies like LinkedIn are not to pursue speed. Instead, they need to devise strategies where their slowness can become a strength.

**6)  Simplicity**  

When there's a complex list of pros and cons for a decision, Reid seeks a single decisive reason.  

There should be 1 strong reason to do something. When you come up with a list of many reasons, it is usually you trying to convince yourself. 

**7)  Empowerment** 

How do you know you have A-players on your team?  

You know if they don't just accept the strategy you handed them.  

**8) Every weakness has a corresponding strength.** 

 If you try to mitigate a weakness, you might also eliminate the corresponding strength. 

 Example - unorganized ( weakness) -&gt; creative ( corresponding strength)

**9) Values that shape a culture has both upside and downside**

Example - In the early days PayPal had the culture of ""let the best ideas win""  

Upside - Analytic rigor tends to produce better ideas 

Downside - Confrontational culture undermines collaboration. A harder place for experienced people to work. 

**10) Reason is the steering wheel. Emotion is the gas pedal**  

You need emotions to be decisive. But that needs to be directed in the right direction. 

**11)  Trade up on trust. Even if it means you trade down on competency.**   

Should you start a company with friends?   All things being equal, Reid says yes. Because you can move quickly.  

( Friends + fast learner ) &gt; ( qualified + stranger ) 

**12) Make people partners. They'll work harder.** 

Give Equity 

Share the Co-founder title 

Be generous 

**13) People you spend the most time with will change you in ways you cannot anticipate.**  

The most important choice of all is who you choose to surround yourself with.

,Entrepreneur,"So recently Instagram made changes to their algorithm. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t playing anymore games he wants us all to pay to reach our followers. It’s either you pay or you enslave yourself to the platform. It could get really frustrating when you know you have a shit load of active followers yet you’re only able to reach 1% of them. So here’s how I’m getting around this. 

1. You need multiple accounts. 

2. Let your fans know you’re controlling all those accounts and they can reach out to you on either one of these accounts. 

3. Instagram allows you to control up to 5 accounts from the same device. You can control more account if you know how, but 5 should be enough to start. 

4. Learn how to get followers and engage with them. You can engage by writing stuff in your stories, or going live. You can even do videos speaking about random topics because often times live videos don’t get as much views as actual stories. 

5. Don’t forget to factor in Snapchat stories and Facebook stories. 

6. Personally I have 2 personal facebook accounts and they both average 70 views per story. I have Snapchat account that averages 60 views. My Facebook page averages 110 views per story. I have a main Instagram account that averages 120 views per story. I have 2 other Instagram accounts which both average 30 views per story. 

I hope you guys get the picture stop worrying about how much views your main page gets, you have to spread it across multiple accounts and multiple platforms. You have to engage with your fans everywhere. 

Side note:
I get around 500 views per video I post on twitter. 200 views per TikTok video currently. Stop worrying about having a million fans on one account. The game is volume. Post a couple times a day across 20-30 accounts. That’s how you get around this crazy system created by Mark Zuck. 😂

Hope y’all enjoyed this read. 🖤

Edit: I also have a Facebook messenger list that I created. It’s at 1300 contacts at the moment. My list currently has a 90% open rate. Facebook messenger is a platform too.

Here’s a hack that can help you sleep well at night.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'How to Grow'}]",r/Entrepreneur,False,6,blacknwhitesmall,0,,False,t3_jveak4,False,dark,0.63,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},How to Grow,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605586879.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.Entrepreneur,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So recently Instagram made changes to their algorithm. Mark Zuckerberg isn’t playing anymore games he wants us all to pay to reach our followers. It’s either you pay or you enslave yourself to the platform. It could get really frustrating when you know you have a shit load of active followers yet you’re only able to reach 1% of them. So here’s how I’m getting around this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need multiple accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let your fans know you’re controlling all those accounts and they can reach out to you on either one of these accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram allows you to control up to 5 accounts from the same device. You can control more account if you know how, but 5 should be enough to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how to get followers and engage with them. You can engage by writing stuff in your stories, or going live. You can even do videos speaking about random topics because often times live videos don’t get as much views as actual stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to factor in Snapchat stories and Facebook stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
